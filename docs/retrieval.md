# Retrieval

Large language models are trained on massive datasets, but they don't know everything. That's where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in, and LangChain has you covered with all the basics to Advanced bulding blocks:

1. **Document loaders:**
   Learn how to put your own information into the training mix.

2. **Text Splitters:**
   Find out how to tweak your data to make the model understand better.

3. **Text Embedding Models:**
   Discover ways to seamlessly include your information within the model.

4. **Vector Stores:**
   Explore ways to save these tweaks for quick and efficient retrieval.

5. **Retrievers:**
   Learn how to ask the model for the information you stored.

LangChain breaks down each step, making it easy for you to make the most of RAG with your language models.
