<h1>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</h1>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="22">Chapter 22</h2><h3>The Scientific
Method</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Something, somewhere, somewhen,
must have happened differently...</i></p>
<p>PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of
Biochemistry at Oxford.</p>
<p>HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the
brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a
logarithm was. He's read <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i> and <i>Judgment
Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases</i> and volume one of
<i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics.</i> And despite what everyone
who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next
Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the
laws of magic and become a god.</p>
<p>HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except
broomstick riding.</p>
<p>DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old
boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.</p>
<p>PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching
Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class,
Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go
wrong with the Defense Professor this time.</p>
<p>DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game
which involved setting fire to a chicken.</p>
<p>DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere
private and scream for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Presenting:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF
RATIONALITY</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">You ain't guessin' where this one's
going.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Some notes:</i></p>
<p>The opinions of characters in this story are not necessarily
those of the author. What warm!Harry thinks is <i>often</i> meant
as a good pattern to follow, especially if Harry thinks about how
he can cite scientific studies to back up a particular principle.
But not everything Harry does or thinks is a good idea. That
wouldn't work as a story. And the less warm characters may
sometimes have valuable lessons to offer, but those lessons may
also be dangerously double-edged.</p>
<p>If you haven't visited <b>HPMOR DOT COM</b>, don't forget to do
that at some point; otherwise you'll miss out on the fan art, how
to learn everything Harry knows, and more.</p>
<p>If you haven't just enjoyed this fic, but learned something from
it, then please consider blogging it or tweeting it. A work like
this only does as much good as there are people who read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>And now, back to your regularly
scheduled fic...</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The key to strategy is not to choose <i>a</i> path to J. K.
Rowling, but to choose so that <i>all</i> paths lead to a J. K.
Rowling.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A small study room, near but not in the Ravenclaw dorm, one of
the many many unused rooms of Hogwarts. Gray stone the floors, red
brick the walls, dark stained wood the ceiling, four glowing glass
globes set into the four walls of the room. A circular table that
looked like a wide slab of black marble set on thick black marble
legs for columns, but which had proved to be very light (weight and
mass both) and wasn't difficult to pick up and move around if
necessary. Two comfortably cushioned chairs which had seemed at
first to be locked to the floor in inconvenient places, but which
would, the two of them had finally discovered, scoot around to
where you stood as soon as you leaned over in a posture that looked
like you were about to sit down.</p>
<p>There also seemed to be a number of bats flying around the
room.</p>
<p>That was where, future historians would one day record -
<i>if</i> the whole project ever actually amounted to anything -
the scientific study of magic had begun, with two young first-year
Hogwarts students.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, theorist.</p>
<p>And Hermione Jean Granger, experimenter and test subject.</p>
<p>Harry was doing better in classes now, at least the classes he
considered interesting. He'd read more books, and not books for
eleven-year-olds either. He'd practiced Transfiguration over and
over during one of his extra hours every day, taking the other hour
for beginning Occlumency. He was taking the worthwhile classes
<i>seriously,</i> not just turning in his homework every day, but
using his free time to learn more than was required, to read other
books beyond the given textbooks, looking to master the subject and
not just memorize a few test answers, to excel. You didn't see that
much outside Ravenclaw. And now even <i>within</i> Ravenclaw, his
only remaining competitors were Padma Patil (whose parents came
from a non-English-speaking culture and thus had raised her with an
actual work ethic), Anthony Goldstein (out of a certain tiny ethnic
group that won 25% of the Nobel Prizes), and of course, striding
far above everyone like a Titan strolling through a pack of
puppies, Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>To run this particular experiment you needed the test subject to
learn sixteen new spells, on their own, without help or correction.
That meant the test subject was Hermione. Period.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned at this point that the bats flying around
the room were <i>not</i> glowing.</p>
<p>Harry was having trouble accepting the implications of this.</p>
<p>"<i>Oogely boogely!</i>" Hermione said again.</p>
<p>Again, at the tip of Hermione's wand, there was the abrupt,
transitionless appearance of a bat. One moment, empty air. The next
moment, bat. Its wings seemed to be already moving in the instant
when it appeared.</p>
<p>And it <i>still wasn't glowing.</i></p>
<p>"Can I stop now?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Are you sure," Harry said through what seemed to be a block in
his throat, "that maybe with a bit more practice you couldn't get
it to glow?" He was violating the experimental procedure he'd
written down beforehand, which was a sin, and he was violating it
because he didn't like the results he was getting, which was a
<i>mortal</i> sin, you could go to Science Hell for that, but it
didn't seem to be mattering anyway.</p>
<p>"What did you change this time?" Hermione said, sounding a
little weary.</p>
<p>"The durations of the <i>oo,</i> <i>eh,</i> and <i>ee</i>
sounds. It's supposed to be 3 to 2 to 2, not 3 to 1 to 1."</p>
<p>"<i>Oogely boogely!</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>The bat materialized with only one wing and spun pathetically to
the floor, flopping around in a circle on the gray stone.</p>
<p>"Now what is it really?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"3 to 2 to 1."</p>
<p>"<i>Oogely boogely!</i>"</p>
<p>This time the bat didn't have any wings at all and fell with a
plop like a dead mouse.</p>
<p>"3 to 1 to 2."</p>
<p>And lo the bat did materialize and it did fly up at once toward
the ceiling, healthy and glowing a bright green.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded in satisfaction. "Okay, what next?"</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"<i>Seriously?</i> You <i>seriously</i> have to say <i>Oogely
boogely</i> with the duration of the <i>oo,</i> <i>eh,</i> and
<i>ee</i> sounds having a ratio of 3 to 1 to 2, or the bat won't
glow? <i>Why? Why? For the love of all that is sacred,
why?</i>"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"<i>AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!</i>"</p>
<p><i>Thud. Thud. Thud.</i></p>
<p>Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, and
then designed a series of experiments based on the premise that
virtually everything wizards believed about magic was wrong.</p>
<p>You couldn't <i>really</i> need to say 'Wingardium Leviosa' in
exactly the right way in order to levitate something, because, come
on, 'Wingardium Leviosa'? The universe was going to check that you
said 'Wingardium Leviosa' in exactly the right way and otherwise it
wouldn't make the quill float?</p>
<p>No. Obviously no, once you thought about it seriously. Someone,
quite possibly an actual preschool child, but at any rate some
English-speaking magic user, who thought that 'Wingardium Leviosa'
sounded all flyish and floaty, had originally spoken those words
while casting the spell for the first time. And then told everyone
else it was necessary.</p>
<p>But (Harry had reasoned) it didn't <i>have</i> to be that way,
it wasn't built into the universe, it was built into
<i>you</i>.</p>
<p>There was an old story passed down among scientists, a
cautionary tale, the story of Blondlot and the N-Rays.</p>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of X-Rays, an eminent French
physicist named Prosper-Rene Blondlot - who had been first to
measure the speed of radio waves and show that they propagated at
the speed of light - had announced the discovery of an amazing new
phenomenon, N-Rays, which would induce a faint brightening of a
screen. You had to look hard to see it, but it was there. N-Rays
had all sorts of interesting properties. They were bent by
aluminium and could be focused by an aluminium prism into striking
a treated thread of cadmium sulfide, which would then glow faintly
in the dark...</p>
<p>Soon dozens of other scientists had confirmed Blondlot's
results, especially in France.</p>
<p>But there were still other scientists, in England and Germany,
who said they weren't quite sure they could see that faint
glow.</p>
<p>Blondlot had said they were probably setting up the machinery
wrong.</p>
<p>One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lights
had turned out, and his assistant had called off the brightening
and darkening as Blondlot performed his manipulations.</p>
<p>It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as
expected.</p>
<p>Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had quietly
stolen the aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot's
mechanism.</p>
<p>And that had been the end of N-Rays.</p>
<p><i>Reality,</i> Philip K. Dick had once said, <i>is that which,
when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.</i></p>
<p>Blondlot's sin had been obvious in retrospect. He shouldn't have
told his assistant what he was doing. Blondlot should have made
sure the assistant <i>didn't</i> know what was being tried or when
it was being tried, before asking him to describe the screen's
brightness. It could have been that simple.</p>
<p>Nowadays it was called "blinding" and it was one of the things
modern scientists took for granted. If you were doing a psychology
experiment to see whether people got angrier when they were hit
over the head with red truncheons than with green truncheons, you
didn't get to look at the subjects yourself and decide how "angry"
they were. You would snap photos of them after they'd been hit with
the truncheon, and send the photos off to a panel of raters, who
would rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how angry each person looked,
obviously <i>without</i> knowing what color of truncheon they'd
been hit with. Indeed there was no good reason to tell the raters
what the experiment was about, at all. You <i>certainly</i>
wouldn't tell the experimental subjects that <i>you thought</i>
they ought to be angrier when hit by red truncheons. You'd just
offer them 20 pounds, lure them into a test room, hit them with a
truncheon, color randomly assigned of course, and snap the photo.
In fact the truncheon-hitting and photo-snapping would be done by
an assistant who hadn't been told about the hypothesis, so he
couldn't look expectant, hit harder, or snap the photo at just the
right time.</p>
<p>Blondlot had destroyed his reputation with the sort of mistake
that would get a failing grade and probably derisive laughter from
the T.A. in a first-year undergraduate course on experimental
design... in 1991.</p>
<p>But this had been a bit longer ago, in 1904, and so it had taken
months before Robert Wood had formulated the obvious alternative
hypothesis and figured out how to test it, and dozens of other
scientists had been sucked in.</p>
<p>More than two centuries after science had gotten started. That
late in scientific history, it still hadn't been obvious.</p>
<p>Which made it <i>entirely</i> plausible that in the tiny
wizarding world, where science didn't seem much known at all, no
one had ever tried the first, the simplest, the most obvious thing
that any modern scientist would think to check.</p>
<p>The books were full of complicated instructions for all the
things you had to do <i>exactly right</i> in order to cast a spell.
And, Harry had hypothesized, the process of obeying those
instructions, of checking that you were following them correctly,
probably <i>did</i> do something. It <i>forced you to concentrate
on the spell</i>. Being told to just wave your wand and wish
probably <i>wouldn't</i> work as well. And once you believed the
spell was supposed to work a certain way, once you had practiced it
that way, you might not be able to convince yourself that it could
work any <i>other</i> way...</p>
<p>...if you did the simple but wrong thing, and tried to test
alternative forms <i>yourself.</i></p>
<p>But what if you <i>didn't know</i> what the original spell had
been like?</p>
<p>What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn't studied
yet, taken from a book of silly prank spells in the Hogwarts
library, and some of those spells had the correct and original
instructions, while others had one changed gesture, one changed
word? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told her that
a spell supposed to create a red worm was supposed to create a blue
worm instead?</p>
<p>Well, in that case, it had turned out...</p>
<p>...Harry was having trouble believing his results here...</p>
<p>...if you told Hermione to say "Oogely boogely" with the vowel
durations in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 1, instead of the correct ratio
of 3 to 1 to 2, you still got the bat but it wouldn't glow any
more.</p>
<p>Not that belief was <i>irrelevant</i> here. Not that <i>only</i>
the words and wand movements mattered.</p>
<p>If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what
a spell was supposed to do, it would stop working.</p>
<p>If you didn't tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do,
it would stop working.</p>
<p>If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to
do, or she was only partially wrong, then the spell would work as
originally described in the book, not the way she'd been told it
should.</p>
<p>Harry was, at this moment, literally banging his head against
the brick wall. Not hard. He didn't want to damage his precious
brains. But if he didn't have some outlet for his frustration, he
would spontaneously catch on fire.</p>
<p><i>Thud. Thud. Thud.</i></p>
<p>It seemed the universe actually <i>did</i> want you to say
'Wingardium Leviosa' and it wanted you to say it in a certain exact
way and it didn't care what <i>you</i> thought the pronunciation
should be any more than it cared how you felt about gravity.</p>
<p><i>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?</i></p>
<p>The worst part of it was the smug, amused look on Hermione's
face.</p>
<p>Hermione had <i>not</i> been okay with sitting around obediently
following Harry's instructions without being told why.</p>
<p>So Harry had explained to her what they were testing.</p>
<p>Harry had explained why they were testing it.</p>
<p>Harry had explained why probably no wizard had tried it before
them.</p>
<p>Harry had explained that he was actually fairly confident of his
prediction.</p>
<p>Because, Harry had said, there was <i>no way</i> that the
universe actually wanted you to say 'Wingardium Leviosa'.</p>
<p>Hermione had pointed out that this was not what her books said.
Hermione had asked if Harry really thought he was smarter, at
eleven years old and just over a month into his Hogwarts education,
than all the other wizards in the world who disagreed with him.</p>
<p>Harry had said the following exact words:</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>Now Harry was staring at the red brick directly in front of him
and contemplating how hard he would have to hit his head in order
to give himself a concussion that would interfere with long-term
memory formation and prevent him from remembering this later.
Hermione wasn't laughing, but he could feel her <i>intent to
laugh</i> radiating out from behind him like a dreadful pressure on
his skin, sort of like knowing you were being stalked by a serial
killer only <i>worse.</i></p>
<p>"Say it," Harry said.</p>
<p>"I wasn't <i>going</i> to," said the kindly voice of Hermione
Granger. "It didn't seem nice."</p>
<p>"Just get it over with," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Okay! So you gave me this <i>whole long lecture</i> about how
hard it was to do basic science and how we might need to stay on
the problem for <i>thirty-five years</i>, and then you went and
expected us to make the greatest discovery in the history of magic
in the first hour we were working together. You didn't just hope,
you really expected it. You're silly."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Now -"</p>
<p>"I've read all the books you gave me and I still don't know what
to call that. Overconfidence? Planning fallacy? Super duper Lake
Wobegon effect? They'll have to name it after you. Harry Bias."</p>
<p>"All <i>right!</i>"</p>
<p>"But it <i>is</i> cute. It's such a boy thing to do."</p>
<p>"<i>Drop dead.</i>"</p>
<p>"Aw, you say the most romantic things."</p>
<p><i>Thud. Thud. Thud.</i></p>
<p>"So what's next?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry rested his head against the bricks. His forehead was
starting to hurt where he'd been banging it. "Nothing. I have to go
back and design different experiments."</p>
<p>Over the last month, Harry had carefully worked out, in advance,
a course of experimentation for them that would have lasted until
December.</p>
<p>It would have been a <i>great</i> set of experiments if the
<i>very first test</i> had not falsified the basic premise.</p>
<p>Harry could not believe he had been this dumb.</p>
<p>"Let me correct myself," said Harry. "I need to design
<i>one</i> new experiment. I'll let you know when we've got it, and
we'll do it, and then I'll design the next one. How does that
sound?"</p>
<p>"It sounds like <i>someone</i> wasted a <i>whole lot of
effort</i>."</p>
<p><i>Thud.</i> Ow. He'd done that a bit harder than he'd
planned.</p>
<p>"So," said Hermione. She was leaning back in her chair and the
smug look was back on her face. "What did we discover today?"</p>
<p>"I discovered," said Harry through gritted teeth, "that when it
comes to doing truly basic research on a genuinely confusing
problem where you have no clue what's going on, my books on
scientific methodology aren't worth crap -"</p>
<p>"Language, Mr. Potter! Some of us are innocent young girls!"</p>
<p>"Fine. But if my books were worth a <i>carp,</i> that's a kind
of fish not anything bad, they would have given me the following
important piece of advice: When there's a confusing problem and
you're just starting out and you have a falsifiable hypothesis, go
test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do
it right away. Don't worry about designing an elaborate course of
experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a
funding agency. Just check as fast as possible whether your ideas
are false before you start investing huge amounts of effort in
them. How does that sound for a moral?"</p>
<p>"Mmm... okay," said Hermione. "But I was also hoping for
something like 'Hermione's books aren't worthless. They're written
by wise old wizards who know way more about magic than I do. I
should pay attention to what Hermione's books say.' Can we have
that moral too?"</p>
<p>Harry's jaw seemed to be clenched too tightly to let any words
out, so he just nodded.</p>
<p>"Great!" Hermione said. "I liked this experiment. We learned a
lot from it and it only took me an hour or so."</p>
<p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH H!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In the dungeons of Slytherin.</p>
<p>An unused classroom lit with eerie green light, much brighter
this time and coming from a small crystal globe with a temporary
enchantment, but eerie green light nonetheless, casting strange
shadows from the dusty desks.</p>
<p>Two boy-sized figures in cowled grey cloaks (no masks) had
entered in silence, and sat down in two chairs opposite the same
desk.</p>
<p>It was the second meeting of the Bayesian Conspiracy.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy hadn't been sure if he should look forward to it or
not.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, judging by the expression on his face, didn't seem
to have any doubts on the appropriate mood.</p>
<p>Harry Potter looked like he was ready to kill someone.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger," said Harry Potter, just as Draco was opening
his mouth. "<i>Don't ask</i>."</p>
<p><i>He couldn't have gone on another date, could he?</i> thought
Draco, but that didn't make any sense.</p>
<p>"Harry," said Draco, "I'm sorry but I have to ask this anyway,
did you <i>really</i> order the mudblood girl an expensive mokeskin
pouch for her birthday?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. You've already worked out why, of course."</p>
<p>Draco reached up and raked fingers through his hair in
frustration, his cowl brushing the back of his hand. He
<i>hadn't</i> been quite sure why, but now he couldn't say so. And
Slytherin <i>knew</i> he was courting Harry Potter, he'd made it
obvious enough in Defense class. "Harry," said Draco, "people know
I'm friends with you, they don't know about the Conspiracy of
course, but they know we're friends, and it makes <i>me</i> look
bad when you do that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Harry Potter's face tightened. "Anyone in Slytherin who can't
understand the concept of acting nice toward people you don't
actually like should be ground up and fed to pet snakes."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people in Slytherin who <i>don't,</i>" Draco
said, his voice serious. "Most people are stupid, and you have to
look good in front of them anyway." Harry Potter <i>had</i> to
understand that if he ever wanted to get anywhere in life.</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> care what other people think? Are you really
going to live your life needing to explain everything you do to the
dumbest idiots in Slytherin, letting <i>them</i> judge <i>you?</i>
I'm sorry, Draco, but I'm not lowering my cunning plots to the
level of what the dumbest Slytherins can understand, just because
it might make you look bad otherwise. Not even your friendship is
worth that. It would <i>take all the fun out of life.</i> Tell me
<i>you</i> haven't ever thought the same thing when someone in
Slytherin is being too stupid to breathe, that it's beneath the
dignity of a Malfoy to have to pander to them."</p>
<p>Draco genuinely hadn't. Ever. Pandering to idiots was like
breathing, you did it without thinking about it.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said at last. "Just doing whatever you want,
without worrying about how it looks, isn't smart. The <i>Dark
Lord</i> worried about how he looked! He was feared and hated, and
he knew <i>exactly</i> what sort of fear and hate he wanted to
create. <i>Everyone</i> has to worry about what other people
think."</p>
<p>The cowled figure shrugged. "Perhaps. Remind me sometime to tell
you about something called Asch's Conformity Experiment, you might
find it quite amusing. For now I'll just note that it's dangerous
to worry about what other people think on <i>instinct,</i> because
you <i>actually care,</i> not as a matter of cold-blooded
calculation. Remember, I was beaten and bullied by older Slytherins
for fifteen minutes, and afterward I stood up and graciously
forgave them. Just like the good and virtuous Boy-Who-Lived ought
to do. But my cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell me that I have
<i>no use</i> for the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, since <i>I don't
own a pet snake.</i> So I have no reason to care what they think
about how I conduct my duel with Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>Draco did not clench his fists in frustration. "She's just some
mudblood," Draco said, keeping his voice calm, rather than
shouting. "If you don't like her, push her down the stairs."</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw would know -"</p>
<p>"Have Pansy Parkinson push her down the stairs! You wouldn't
even have to manipulate her, offer her a Sickle and she'd do
it!"</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> would know! Hermione beat me in a book-reading
contest, she's getting better grades than me, I have to defeat her
with my <i>brain</i> or it doesn't count!"</p>
<p>"<i>She's just a mudblood! Why do you respect her that
much?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>She's a power among Ravenclaws! Why do you care what some
powerless idiot in Slytherin thinks?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>It's called politics! And if you can't play it you can't
have power!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Walking on the moon is power! Being a great wizard is power!
There are kinds of power that don't require me to spend the rest of
my life pandering to morons!</i>"</p>
<p>Both of them stopped, and, in almost perfect unison, began
taking deep breaths to calm themselves.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry Potter said after a few moments, wiping sweat
from his forehead. "Sorry, Draco. You've got a lot of political
power and it makes sense for you to keep it. You <i>should</i> be
calculating what Slytherin thinks. It's an important game and I
shouldn't have insulted it. But you can't ask <i>me</i> to lower
the level of my game in Ravenclaw, just so that you don't look bad
by associating with me. Tell Slytherin you're gritting your teeth
while you pretend to be my friend."</p>
<p>That was exactly what Draco <i>had</i> told Slytherin, and he
still wasn't sure whether it was true.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Draco said. "Speaking of your image. I'm afraid I've
got some bad news. Rita Skeeter heard some of the stories about you
and she's been asking questions."</p>
<p>Harry Potter raised his eyebrows. "Who?"</p>
<p>"She writes for the <i>Daily Prophet,</i>" Draco said. He tried
to keep the worry out of his voice. The <i>Daily Prophet</i> was
one of Father's primary tools, he used it like a wizard's wand.
"That's the newspaper people actually pay attention to. Rita
Skeeter writes about celebrities, and as she puts it, uses her
quill to puncture their over-inflated reputations. If she can't
find any rumors about you, she'll just make up her own."</p>
<p>"I <i>see,</i>" said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked
very thoughtful beneath the cowl.</p>
<p>Draco hesitated before saying what he had to say next. By now
someone had certainly reported to Father that he was courting Harry
Potter, and Father would also know that Draco hadn't written home
about it, and Father would understand that Draco didn't think he
could actually keep it a secret, which sent a clear message that
Draco was practicing his own game now but still on Father's side,
since if Draco had been tempted away, he would have been sending
false reports.</p>
<p>It followed that Father had probably anticipated what Draco was
about to say next.</p>
<p>Playing the game with Father for real was a rather unnerving
sensation. Even if they were on the same side. It was, on the one
hand, exhiliarating, but Draco also knew that in the end it would
turn out that Father had played the game better. There was no other
way it could possibly go.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco finally said. "This isn't a suggestion. This
isn't my advice. Just the way it is. My father could almost
certainly quash that article. But it would cost you."</p>
<p>That Father had been expecting Draco to tell Harry Potter
exactly that was not something Draco said out loud. Harry Potter
would work it out on his own, or not.</p>
<p>But instead Harry Potter shook his head, smiling beneath the
cowl. "I have no intention of trying to quash Rita Skeeter."</p>
<p>Draco didn't even try to keep the incredulity out of his voice.
"You <i>can't</i> tell me you don't care what the <i>newspaper</i>
says about you!"</p>
<p>"I care less than you might think," said Harry Potter. "But I
have my own ways of dealing with the likes of Skeeter. I don't need
Lucius's help."</p>
<p>A worried look came over Draco's face before he could stop it.
Whatever Harry Potter was about to do next, it would be something
Father wasn't expecting, and Draco was feeling very nervous about
where that might lead.</p>
<p>Draco also realized that his hair was getting sweaty underneath
the cowl. He'd never actually worn one of those before, and hadn't
realized that the Death Eaters' cloaks probably had things like
Cooling Charms.</p>
<p>Harry Potter wiped some sweat from his forehead again, grimaced,
took out his wand, pointed it upward, took a deep breath, and said
"<i>Frigideiro!</i>"</p>
<p>Moments later Draco felt the cold draft.</p>
<p>"<i>Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!
Frigideiro!</i>"</p>
<p>Then Harry Potter lowered the wand, though his hand seemed a bit
shaky, and put it back into his robes.</p>
<p>The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could have done
that too, but still, not bad.</p>
<p>"So," Draco said. "Science. You're going to tell me about
blood."</p>
<p>"We're going to <i>find out</i> about blood," Harry Potter said.
"By doing experiments."</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. "What sort of experiments?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath his cowl, and said, "You tell
me."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco had heard of something called the Socratic Method, which
was teaching by asking questions (named after an ancient
philosopher who had been too smart to be a real Muggle and hence
had been a disguised pureblood wizard). One of his tutors had used
Socratic teaching a lot. It had been annoying but effective.</p>
<p>Then there was the Potter Method, which was insane.</p>
<p>To be fair, Draco had to admit that Harry Potter had tried the
Socratic Method first and it hadn't been working too well.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had asked how Draco would go about
<i>disproving</i> the blood purist hypothesis that wizards couldn't
do the neat stuff now that they'd done eight centuries ago because
they had interbred with Muggleborns and Squibs.</p>
<p>Draco had said that he did not understand how Harry Potter could
sit there with a straight face and claim this was not a trap.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had replied, still with a straight face, that if it
was a trap it would have been so pathetically obvious that
<i>he</i> ought to be ground up and fed to pet snakes, but it was
<i>not</i> a trap, it was simply a rule of how scientists operated
that you had to try to disprove your own theories, and if you made
an honest effort and failed, that was victory.</p>
<p>Draco had tried to point out the staggering stupidity of this by
suggesting that the key to surviving a duel was to cast Avada
Kedavra on your own foot and miss.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had <i>nodded</i>.</p>
<p>Draco had shaken his head.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had then presented the idea that scientists watched
ideas fight to see which ones won, and you <i>couldn't fight
without an opponent,</i> so Draco needed to figure out opponents
for the blood purist hypothesis to fight so that blood purism could
win, which Draco understood a little better even though Harry
Potter had said it with a rather distasteful look. Like, it was
clear that if blood purism was the way the world really was, then
the sky just had to be blue, and if some other theory was true, the
sky just had to be green; and nobody had seen the sky yet; and then
you went outside and looked and the blood purists won; and after
this had happened six times in a row, people would start noticing
the trend.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had then proceeded to claim that all the opponents
Draco was inventing were too weak, so blood purism wouldn't get
credit for defeating them because the battle wouldn't be impressive
enough. Draco had understood that too. <i>Wizards have gotten
weaker because house elves are stealing our magic</i> hadn't
sounded impressive to him either.</p>
<p>(Though Harry Potter <i>had</i> said that one at least was
testable, in that they could try to check if house elves had gotten
stronger over time, and even draw a picture representing the
increasing strength of house elves and another picture representing
the decreasing strength of wizards and if the two pictures matched
that would point to the house elves, all said in such completely
serious tones that Draco had felt an impulse to ask Dobby a few
pointed questions under Veritaserum before snapping out of it.)</p>
<p>And Harry Potter had finally said that Draco <i>couldn't</i> fix
the battle, scientists weren't dumb, it would be <i>obvious</i> if
you fixed the battle, it had to be a <i>real fight,</i> between two
different theories that might both <i>really</i> be true, with a
test that only the <i>true</i> hypothesis would win, something that
actually <i>would</i> come out different ways depending on which
hypothesis was actually correct, and there would be experienced
scientists watching to make sure that was exactly what happened.
Harry Potter had claimed that he himself just wanted to know <i>how
blood really worked</i> and for that he need to see blood purism
<i>really win</i> and Draco wasn't going to fool <i>him</i> with
theories that were just there to be knocked down.</p>
<p>Even having seen the point, Draco hadn't been able to invent any
"plausible alternatives", as Harry Potter put it, to the idea that
wizards were getting less powerful because they were mixing their
blood with mud. It was too obviously true.</p>
<p>It was then that Harry Potter had said, rather frustrated, that
he couldn't imagine Draco was <i>really</i> this bad at considering
different viewpoints, <i>surely</i> there'd been Death Eaters who'd
posed as enemies of blood purism and had come up with much more
plausible-sounding arguments against their own side than Draco was
offering. If Draco had been trying to pose as a member of
Dumbledore's faction, and come up with the house elf hypothesis, he
wouldn't have fooled anyone for a second.</p>
<p>Draco had been forced to admit this was a point.</p>
<p>Hence the Potter Method.</p>
<p>"Please, Dr. Malfoy," whined Harry Potter, "why won't you accept
my paper?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter had needed to repeat the phrase "just pretend to be
pretending to be a scientist" three times before Draco had
understood.</p>
<p>In that moment Draco had realized that there was something
deeply <i>wrong</i> with Harry Potter's brain, and anyone who tried
Legilimency on it would probably never come back out again.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had then gone into further and considerable detail:
Draco was to pretend to be a Death Eater who was posing as the
editor of a scientific journal, Dr. Malfoy, who wanted to reject
his enemy Dr. Potter's paper "On the Heritability of Magical
Ability", and if the Death Eater didn't act like a real scientist
would, he would be revealed as a Death Eater and executed, while
Dr. Malfoy was also being watched by his own rivals and needed to
<i>appear</i> to reject Dr. Potter's paper for neutral scientific
reasons or he would lose his position as journal editor.</p>
<p>It was a wonder the Sorting Hat wasn't gibbering madly in St.
Mungo's.</p>
<p>It was also the most complicated thing anyone had <i>ever</i>
asked Draco to pretend and there was no possible way he could have
refused the challenge.</p>
<p>Right now they were, as Harry Potter had put it, getting in the
mood.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid, Dr. Potter, that you wrote this in the wrong color
of ink," Draco said. "Next!"</p>
<p>Dr. Potter's face did an excellent job of crumpling in despair,
and Draco couldn't help but feel a flash of Dr. Malfoy's glee, even
though the Death Eater was only pretending to be Dr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>This part was <i>fun.</i> He could have done this all day
long.</p>
<p>Dr. Potter got up from the chair, slumped over in dismay, and
trudged off, and turned into Harry Potter, who gave Draco a
thumbs-up, and then turned back into Dr. Potter again, now
approaching with an eager smile.</p>
<p>Dr. Potter sat down and presented Dr. Malfoy with a piece of
parchment on which was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>On the Heritability of Magical
Ability</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Dr. H. J. Potter-Evans-Verres,
Institute for Sufficiently Advanced Science</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>My observation:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Today's wizards can't do things as
impressive as<br />
what wizards used to do 800 years ago.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>My conclusion:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Wizardkind has become weaker by
mixing<br />
their blood with Muggleborns and Squibs.</i></p>
<p>"Dr. Malfoy," said Dr. Potter with a hopeful look, "I was
wondering if the <i>Journal of Irreproducible Results</i> could
consider for publication my paper entitled 'On the Heritability of
Magical Ability'."</p>
<p>Draco looked at the parchment, smiling while he considered
possible rejections. If he was a professor, he would have refused
the essay as too short, so -</p>
<p>"It's too long, Dr. Potter," said Dr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>For a moment there was genuine incredulity on Dr. Potter's
face.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Dr. Potter. "How about if I get rid of the separate
lines for observations and conclusions, and just put in a
<i>therefore</i> -"</p>
<p>"Then it'll be too short. Next!"</p>
<p>Dr. Potter trudged off.</p>
<p>"All right," said Harry Potter, "you're getting <i>too</i> good
at this. Two more times to practice, and then third time is for
real, no interruptions between, I'll just come in straight at you
and that time you'll reject the paper based on the actual content,
remember, your scientific rivals are watching."</p>
<p>Dr. Potter's next paper was perfect in every way, a marvel of
its kind, but unfortunately had to be rejected because Dr. Malfoy's
journal was having trouble with the letter E. Dr. Potter offered to
rewrite it without those words, and Dr. Malfoy explained that it
was really more of a vowel problem.</p>
<p>The paper after that was rejected because it was Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, Saturday.</p>
<p>Dr. Potter tried to point this out and was told "Next!"</p>
<p>(Draco was starting to understand why Snape had used his hold
over Dumbledore just to get a position that let him be awful to
students.)</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>Dr. Potter was approaching with a superior smirk on his
face.</p>
<p>"This is my latest paper, <i>On the Heritability of Magical
Ability,</i>" Dr. Potter stated confidently, and thrust out the
parchment. "I have decided to allow your journal to publish it, and
have prepared it in perfect accordance with your guidelines so that
you may publish it quickly."</p>
<p>The Death Eater decided to track down and kill Dr. Potter after
his mission was done. Dr. Malfoy kept a polite smile on his face,
since his rivals were watching, and said...</p>
<p>(The pause stretched, with Dr. Potter looking at him
impatiently.)</p>
<p>..."Let me look at that, please."</p>
<p>Dr. Malfoy took the parchment and perused it carefully.</p>
<p>The Death Eater was starting to get nervous about the fact that
he wasn't a real scientist, and Draco was trying to remember how to
talk like Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"You, ah, need to consider other possible explanations for your,
um, observation, besides just this one -"</p>
<p>"Really?" interrupted Dr. Potter. "Like what, exactly? <i>House
elves are stealing our magic?</i> My data admit of only one
possible conclusion, Dr. Malfoy. There <i>are</i> no other
plausible hypotheses."</p>
<p>Draco was trying furiously to order his brain to think, what
would he say if he was posing as a member of Dumbledore's faction,
what <i>did</i> they claim was the explanation for wizardkind's
decline, Draco had never bothered to actually ask that...</p>
<p>"If you can't think of any other way to explain my data, you'll
have to publish my paper, <i>Dr. Malfoy.</i>"</p>
<p>It was the sneer on Dr. Potter's face that did it.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" snapped Dr. Malfoy. "How do you know that magic
itself isn't fading away?"</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>Draco and Harry Potter exchanged looks of appalled horror.</p>
<p>Then Harry Potter spat something that was probably an extremely
bad word if you'd been raised by Muggles. "<i>I didn't think of
that!</i>" said Harry Potter. "And I should have. The magic goes
away. <i>Damn, damn, damn!</i>"</p>
<p>The alarm in Harry Potter's voice was contagious. Without even
thinking about it, Draco's hand went into his robes and clutched at
his wand. He'd thought the House of Malfoy was <i>safe,</i> so long
as you only married into families that could trace their bloodlines
back four generations you were supposed to be <i>safe,</i> it had
never occurred to him before that there might be nothing anyone
could do to stop the end of magic. "Harry, what do we do?" Draco's
voice was rising in panic. "<i>What do we do?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Let me think!</i>"</p>
<p>After a few moments, Harry grabbed from a nearby desk the same
quill and roll of parchment he'd used to write his pretend paper,
and started scribbling something.</p>
<p>"We'll figure it out," Harry said, his voice tight, "if magic is
fading out of the world we'll figure out how fast it's fading and
how much time we have left to do something, and then we'll figure
out why it's fading, and then we'll do something about it. Draco,
have wizarding powers been declining at a steady rate, or have
there been sudden drops?"</p>
<p>"I... I don't know..."</p>
<p>"You told me that no one had matched the four founders of
Hogwarts. So it's been going on for at least eight centuries, then?
You can't remember hearing anything about the problems suddenly
appearing five centuries ago or anything like that?"</p>
<p>Draco was trying frantically to think. "I always heard that
nobody was as good as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good
as the Founders of Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. He was still scribbling. "Because three
centuries ago is when Muggles started to not believe in magic,
which I thought might have something to do with it. And about a
century and a half ago was when Muggles began using a kind of
technology that stops working around magic and I was wondering if
it might also go the other way around."</p>
<p>Draco exploded out of his chair, so angry he could hardly even
speak. "It's the <i>Muggles</i> -"</p>
<p>"<i>Damn it!</i>" roared Harry. "Weren't you even listening to
<i>yourself?</i> It's been going on for eight centuries at least
and the Muggles weren't doing anything interesting then! <i>We have
to figure out the real truth!</i> The Muggles <i>might</i> have
something to do with this but if they <i>don't</i> and you go
blaming everything on them and that stops us from figuring out
what's <i>really</i> going on then one day you're going to wake up
in the morning and find out that your wand is just a stick of
wood!"</p>
<p>Draco's breath stopped in his throat. His father often said
<i>our wands will break in our hands</i> in his speeches but Draco
had never really thought before about what that <i>meant</i>, it
wasn't going to happen to <i>him</i> after all. And now suddenly it
seemed very real. <i>Just a stick of wood.</i> Draco could imagine
just what it would be like to take out his wand and try to cast a
spell and find that nothing was happening...</p>
<p>That could happen to <i>everyone</i>.</p>
<p>There would be no more wizards, no more magic, ever. Just
Muggles who had a few legends about what their ancestors had been
able to do. Some of the Muggles would be called Malfoy, and that
would be all that was left of the name.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Draco realized why there were
Death Eaters.</p>
<p>He'd always taken for granted that becoming a Death Eater was
something you did when you grew up. Now Draco <i>understood</i>, he
knew why Father and Father's friends had sworn to give their lives
to prevent the nightmare from coming to pass, there were things you
couldn't just stand by and watch happen. But what if it was going
to happen <i>anyway</i>, what if all the sacrifices, all the
friends they'd lost to Dumbledore, the <i>family</i> they'd lost,
what if it had all been for <i>nothing...</i></p>
<p>"Magic <i>can't</i> be fading away," Draco said. His voice was
breaking. "It wouldn't be <i>fair</i>."</p>
<p>Harry stopped scribbling and looked up. His face had an angry
expression. "Your father never told you that life isn't fair?"</p>
<p>Father had said that every single time Draco used the word.
"But, but, it's too awful to believe that -"</p>
<p>"Draco, let me introduce you to something I call the Litany of
Tarski. It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs
like so: <i>If magic is fading out of the world, I want to believe
that magic is fading out of the world. If magic is not fading out
of the world, I want not to believe that magic is fading out of the
world. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.</i> If
we're living in a world where magic is fading, <i>that's what we
have to believe,</i> we have to know what's coming, so we can stop
it, or in the very worst case, be prepared to do what we can in the
time we have left. Not believing it won't stop it from happening.
So the <i>only</i> question we have to ask is whether magic is
<i>actually</i> fading, and if that's the world we live in then
that's what we want to believe. Litany of Gendlin: <i>What's true
is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse.</i> Got that,
Draco? I'm going to make you memorize it later. It's something you
repeat to yourself any time you start wondering if it's a good idea
to believe something that isn't actually true. In fact I want you
to say it right now. <i>What's true is already so, owning up to it
doesn't make it worse.</i> Say it."</p>
<p>"What's true is already so," repeated Draco, his voice
trembling, "owning up to it doesn't make it worse."</p>
<p>"If magic is fading, I want to believe that magic is fading. If
magic is not fading, I want not to believe that magic is fading.
Say it."</p>
<p>Draco repeated back the words, the sickness churning in his
stomach.</p>
<p>"Good," Harry said, "remember, it might <i>not</i> be happening,
and then you won't have to believe it, either. <i>First</i> we just
want to know what's actually going on, which world we actually live
in." Harry turned back to his work, scribbled some more, and then
turned the parchment so Draco could see it. Draco leaned over the
desk and Harry brought the green light closer.</p>
<p><i><u>Observation:</u></i></p>
<p><i>Wizardry isn't as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was
founded.</i></p>
<p><i><u>Hypotheses:</u></i></p>
<p><i>1. Magic itself is fading.<br />
2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.<br />
3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.</i><i><br />
4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something
else besides blood is making them grow up weaker.<br />
5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years
ago?)<br />
6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?
Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had
any children.)</i></p>
<p><i><u>Tests:</u></i></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. His breathing sounded a little calmer.
"Now when you're dealing with a confusing problem and you have no
idea what's going on, the smart thing to do is figure out some
really simple tests, things you can look at right away. We need
fast tests that distinguish between these hypotheses. Observations
that would come out a different way for at least one of them
compared to all the other ones."</p>
<p>Draco stared at the list in shock. He was suddenly realizing
that he knew an awful lot of purebloods who were only children.
Himself, Vincent, Gregory, practically <i>everyone.</i> The two
most powerful wizards everyone talked about were Dumbledore and the
Dark Lord and neither had any children just like Harry had
suspected...</p>
<p>"It's going to be really hard to distinguish between 2 and 6,"
Harry said, "it's in the blood either way, you'd have to try and
track the decline of wizardry and compare that to how many kids
different wizards were having and measure the abilities of
Muggleborns compared to purebloods..." Harry's fingers were tapping
nervously on the desk. "Let's just lump 6 in with 2 and call them
the blood hypothesis for now. 4 is unlikely because then everyone
would notice a sudden drop when the wizards switched to new foods,
it's hard to see what would've changed steadily over 800 years. 5
is unlikely for the same reason, no sudden drop, Muggles weren't
doing anything 800 years back. 4 looks like 2 and 5 looks like 1
anyway. So mainly we should be trying to distinguish between 1, 2,
and 3." Harry turned the parchment to himself, drew an ellipse
around those three numbers, turned it back. "Magic is fading, blood
is weakening, knowledge is disappearing. What test comes out
differently depending on which of those is true? What could we see
that would mean any one of these was false?"</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> don't know!" blurted Draco. "Why are you asking me?
You're the scientist!"</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, a note of pleading desperation in his
voice, "I only know what Muggle scientists know! You grew up in the
wizarding world, I didn't! You know more magic than I do and you
know more <i>about</i> magic than I do and you thought of this
whole idea in the first place, so start thinking like a scientist
and solve this!"</p>
<p>Draco swallowed hard and stared at the paper.</p>
<p>Magic is fading... wizards are interbreeding with Muggles...
knowledge is being lost...</p>
<p>"What does the world look like if magic is fading?" said Harry
Potter. "You know more about magic, you should be the one guessing
not me! Imagine you're telling a story about it, what happens in
the story?"</p>
<p>Draco imagined it. "Charms that used to work stop working."
<i>Wizards wake up and find that their wands are sticks of
wood...</i></p>
<p>"What does the world look like if the wizarding blood gets
weaker?"</p>
<p>"People can't do things their ancestors could do."</p>
<p>"What does the world look like if knowledge is being lost?"</p>
<p>"People don't know how to cast the Charms in the first place..."
said Draco. He stopped, surprised at himself. "That's a test, isn't
it?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded decisively. "That's one." He wrote it down on the
parchment under <i>Tests:</i></p>
<p><i>A. Are there spells we know but can't cast (1 or 2) or are
the lost spells no longer known (3)?</i></p>
<p>"So that distinguishes between 1 and 2 on the one hand, and 3 on
the other hand," said Harry. "Now we need some way to distinguish
between 1 and 2. Magic fading, blood weakening, how could we tell
the difference?"</p>
<p>"What kind of Charms did students used to cast in their first
year at Hogwarts?" said Draco. "If they used to be able to cast
much more powerful Charms, the blood was stronger -"</p>
<p>Harry Potter shook his head. "Or magic itself was stronger. We
have to figure out some way of telling the <i>difference.</i>"
Harry stood up from his chair, began pacing nervously through the
classroom. "No, wait, that might still work. Suppose different
spells use up different amounts of magical energy. Then if the
ambient magic weakened, the powerful spells would die first, but
the spells everyone learns in their first year would stay the
same..." Harry's nervous pacing sped up. "It's not a very good
test, it's more about powerful wizardry being lost versus all
wizardry being lost, someone's blood could be too weak for powerful
wizardry but strong enough for easy spells... Draco, do you know if
more powerful wizards within a <i>single</i> era, like powerful
wizards from just this century, are more powerful as children? If
the Dark Lord had cast the Cooling Charm when he was eleven, could
he have frozen the whole room?"</p>
<p>Draco's face screwed up as he tried to recollect. "I can't
remember hearing anything about the Dark Lord but I think
Dumbledore's supposed to have done something amazing on his
Transfiguration O.W.L.s in fifth year... I think other powerful
wizards were good in Hogwarts too..."</p>
<p>Harry scowled, still pacing. "They could just be studying hard.
Still, if first-year students learned the same spells and seemed
about as powerful then as now, we could call that <i>weak</i>
evidence favoring 1 over 2... wait, hold on." Harry stopped where
he stood. "I have another test that might distinguish between 1 and
2. It would take a while to explain, it uses some things that
scientists know about blood and inheritance, but it's an easy
question to ask. And if we <i>combine</i> my test and your test and
they both come out the same way, that's a strong hint at the
answer." Harry almost ran back to the desk, took the parchment and
wrote:</p>
<p><i>B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of
spells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2,
but blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.)</i></p>
<p><i>C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using
scientific knowledge of blood, will explain later.</i></p>
<p>"Okay," said Harry, "we can at least try to tell the difference
between 1 and 2 and 3, so let's go with this right away, we can
figure out <i>more</i> tests after we do the ones we already have.
Now it's going to look a little odd if Draco Malfoy and Harry
Potter go around asking questions together, so here's my idea.
You'll go through Hogwarts and find old portraits and ask them
about what spells they learned to cast during their first years.
They're portraits so they won't know there's anything odd about
Draco Malfoy doing that. I'll ask recent portraits and living
people about spells we know but can't cast, no one will notice
anything unusual if Harry Potter asks weird questions. And I'll
have to do complicated research about forgotten spells, so I want
you to be the one to gather the data I need for my own scientific
question. It's a simple question and you should be able to find the
answer by asking portraits. You might want to write this down,
ready?"</p>
<p>Draco sat down again and scrabbled in his bookbag for parchment
and quill. When it was laid down on the desk, Draco looked up, face
determined. "Go ahead."</p>
<p>"Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple - don't make
that face, Draco, it's important information. Just ask recent
portraits who are Gryffindors or something. Find portraits who knew
a married Squib couple well enough to know the names of all their
children. Write down the name of each child and whether that child
was a wizard, a Squib, or a Muggle. If they don't know whether the
child was a Squib or a Muggle, write down 'non-wizard'. Write that
down for <i>every</i> child the couple had, don't leave any out. If
the portrait only knows the name of the wizarding children, not the
names of <i>all</i> the children, then don't write down <i>any</i>
data from that couple. It's very important that you only bring me
data from someone who knows <i>all</i> the children a Squib couple
had, well enough to know them all by name. Try to get at least
forty names total, if you can, and if you have time for more, even
better. Have you got all that?"</p>
<p>"Repeat it," Draco said, when he was done writing, and Harry
repeated it.</p>
<p>"I've got it," Draco said, "but why -"</p>
<p>"It has to do with one of the secrets of blood that scientists
already discovered. I'll explain when you get back. Let's split up
and meet back here in an hour, 6:22pm that should be. Are we ready
to go?"</p>
<p>Draco nodded decisively. It was all very rushed, but he'd long
since been taught how to rush.</p>
<p>"Then <i>go!</i>" said Harry Potter and yanked off his cowled
cloak and shoved it into his pouch, which began eating it, and,
without even waiting for his pouch to finish, spun around and began
striding rapidly toward the classroom door, bumping into a desk and
almost falling over in his haste.</p>
<p>By the time Draco had managed to get his own cloak off and stow
it in his bookbag, Harry Potter was gone.</p>
<p>Draco almost ran out the door.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"And then Janet was a Squib," said the portrait of a short young
woman with a gold-trimmed hat.</p>
<p>Draco wrote it down. That was only twenty-eight but it was time
to go back and meet Harry.</p>
<p>He'd needed to ask other portraits to help translating, English
had changed a lot, but the oldest portraits had described
first-year spells that sounded an awful lot like the ones they had
now. Draco had recognized around half of them and the other half
didn't sound any more powerful.</p>
<p>The sick feeling in his stomach had grown with each answer until
finally, unable to take it any more, he'd gone off and asked other
portraits Harry Potter's strange question about Squib marriages,
instead. The first five portraits hadn't known anyone and finally
he'd asked those portraits to ask <i>their</i> acquaintances to ask
<i>their</i> acquaintances and so managed to find some people who'd
actually admit to being friends with Squibs.</p>
<p>(The first-year Slytherin had explained he was working on an
important project with a Ravenclaw and the Ravenclaw had told him
they needed this information and then run off without saying why.
This had garnered many sympathetic looks.)</p>
<p>Draco's feet were heavy as he walked through the corridors of
Hogwarts. He should have been running but he couldn't seem to
muster the energy. He kept on thinking that he didn't want to know
about this, he didn't want to be involved in any of this, he didn't
want this to be his responsibility, just let Harry Potter do it, if
magic was fading let Harry Potter take care of it...</p>
<p>But Draco knew that wasn't right.</p>
<p>Chill the dungeons of Slytherin, gray the stone walls, Draco
usually liked the atmosphere, but now it seemed too much like
fading.</p>
<p>His hand on the doorknob, Harry Potter already inside and
waiting, wearing his cowled cloak.</p>
<p>"The ancient first-year spells," Harry Potter said. "What did
you find?"</p>
<p>"They're no more powerful than the spells we use now."</p>
<p>Harry Potter's fist struck a desk, hard. "Damn it. All right. My
own experiment was a failure, Draco. There's something called the
Interdict of Merlin -"</p>
<p>Draco hit himself on the forehead, realizing.</p>
<p>"- which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells
out of books, even if you find and read a powerful wizard's notes
they won't make sense to you, it has to go from one living mind to
another. I couldn't find any powerful spells that we had the
instructions for but couldn't cast. But if you can't get them out
of old books, why would anyone bother passing them on by word of
mouth after they stopped working? Did you get the data on the Squib
couples?"</p>
<p>Draco started to hand the parchment over -</p>
<p>But Harry Potter held up a hand. "Law of science, Draco. First I
tell you the theory and the prediction. Then you show me the data.
That way you know I'm not just making up a theory to fit; you know
that the theory actually predicted the data in <i>advance.</i> I
have to explain this to you anyway, so I have to explain it
<i>before</i> you show me the data. That's the rule. So put on your
cloak and let's sit down."</p>
<p>Harry Potter sat down at a desk with torn scraps of paper
arranged across its surface. Draco drew his cloak out of his
bookbag, drew it on, and sat down across from Harry on the other
side, giving the paper scraps a puzzled look. They were arranged in
two rows and the rows were about twenty scraps long.</p>
<p>"The secret of blood," said Harry Potter, an intense look on his
face, "is something called deoxyribose nucleic acid. You don't say
that name in front of anyone who's not a scientist. Deoxyribose
nucleic acid is the recipe that tells your body how to grow, two
legs, two arms, short or tall, whether you have brown eyes or
green. It's a material thing, you can <i>see</i> it if you have
microscopes, which are like telescopes only they look at things
that are very small instead of very far away. And that recipe has
two copies of everything, always, in case one copy is broken.
Imagine two long rows of pieces of paper. At each place in the row,
there are two pieces of paper, and when you have children, your
body selects one piece of paper at random from each place in the
row, and the mother's body will do the same, and so the child also
gets two pieces of paper at each place in the row. Two copies of
everything, one from your mother, one from your father, and when
you have children they get one piece of paper from you at random in
each place."</p>
<p>As Harry spoke, his fingers ranged over the paired scraps of
paper, pointing to one part of the pair when he said "from your
mother", the other when he said "from your father". And as Harry
talked about picking a piece of paper at random, his hand pulled a
Knut out of his robes and flipped it; Harry looked at the coin, and
then pointed to the top piece of paper. All without a pause in the
speech.</p>
<p>"Now when it comes to something like being short or tall,
there's a <i>lot</i> of places in the recipe that make
<i>little</i> differences. So if a tall father marries a short
mother, the child gets some pieces of paper saying 'tall' and some
pieces of paper saying 'short', and usually the child ends up
middle-sized. But not always. By luck, the child might get a lot of
pieces saying 'tall', and not many papers saying 'short', and grow
up pretty tall. You could have a tall father with five papers
saying 'tall' and a tall mother with five papers saying 'tall' and
by amazing luck the child gets <i>all ten</i> papers saying 'tall'
and ends up taller than both of them. You see? Blood isn't a
perfect fluid, it doesn't mix perfectly. Deoxyribose nucleic acid
is made up of lots of little pieces, like a glass of pebbles
instead of a glass of water. That's why a child isn't always
exactly in the middle of the parents."</p>
<p>Draco listened with his mouth open. How in Merlin's name had the
Muggles figured all this out? They could <i>see</i> the recipe?</p>
<p>"Now," Harry Potter said, "suppose that, just like with
tallness, there's lots of little places in the recipe where you can
have a piece of paper that says 'magic' or 'not magic'. If you have
enough pieces of paper saying 'magic' you're a wizard, if you have
a <i>lot</i> of pieces of paper you're a powerful wizard, if you
have too few you're a Muggle, and in between you're a Squib. Then,
when two Squibs marry, most of the time the children should also be
Squibs, but once in a while a child will get lucky and get most of
the father's magic papers <i>and</i> most of the mother's magic
papers, and be strong enough to be a wizard. But probably not a
very powerful one. If you started out with a lot of powerful
wizards and they married only each other, they would stay powerful.
But if they started marrying Muggleborns who were just barely
magical, or Squibs... you see? The blood wouldn't mix perfectly, it
would be a glass of pebbles, not a glass of water, because that's
just the way blood works. There would still be powerful wizards now
and then, when they got a lot of magic papers by luck. But they
wouldn't be as powerful as the most powerful wizards from
earlier."</p>
<p>Draco nodded slowly. He'd never heard it explained that way
before. There was a surprising beauty to how exactly it fit.</p>
<p>"<i>But,</i>" Harry said. "That's only <i>one</i> hypothesis.
Suppose that instead there's only a <i>single</i> place in the
recipe that makes you a wizard. Only <i>one</i> place where a piece
of paper can say 'magic' or 'not magic'. And there are two copies
of everything, always. So then there are only three possibilities.
Both copies can say 'magic'. One copy can say 'magic' and one copy
can say 'not magic'. Or both copies can say 'not magic'. Wizards,
Squibs, and Muggles. Muggleborns wouldn't really be born to
Muggles, they would be born to two Squibs, two parents each with
one magic copy who'd grown up in the Muggle world. Now imagine a
witch marries a Squib. Each child will get one paper saying 'magic'
from the mother, always, it doesn't matter which piece gets picked
at random, both say 'magic'. But like flipping a coin, half the
time the child will get a paper saying 'magic' from the father, and
half the time the child will get the father's paper saying 'not
magic'. When a witch marries a Squib, the result won't be a lot of
weak wizarding children. Half the children will be wizards and
witches just as powerful as their mother, and half the children
will be Squibs. Because if there's just <i>one</i> place in the
recipe that makes you a wizard, then magic isn't like a glass of
pebbles that can mix. It's like a single magical pebble, a
sorcerer's stone."</p>
<p>Harry arranged three pairs of papers side by side. On one pair
he wrote 'magic' and 'magic'. On another pair he wrote 'magic' on
the top paper only. And the third pair he left blank.</p>
<p>"In which case," Harry said, "either you have two stones or you
don't. Either you're a wizard or not. Powerful wizards would get
that way by studying harder and practicing more. And if wizards get
<i>inherently</i> less powerful, not because of spells being lost
but because people can't cast them... then maybe they're eating the
wrong foods or something. But if it's gotten steadily worse over
eight hundred years, then that could mean magic itself is fading
out of the world."</p>
<p>Harry arranged another two pairs of papers side by side, and
took out a quill. Soon each pair had one piece of paper saying
'magic' and the other paper blank.</p>
<p>"And that brings me to the prediction," said Harry. "What
happens when two Squibs marry. Flip a coin twice. It can come up
heads and heads, heads and tails, tails and heads, or tails and
tails. So one quarter of the time you'll get two heads, one quarter
of the time you'll get two tails, and half the time you'll get one
heads and one tail. Same thing if two Squibs marry. One quarter of
the children would come up magic and magic, and be wizards. One
quarter would come up not-magic and not-magic, and be Muggles. The
other half would be Squibs. It's a very old and very classic
pattern. It was discovered by Gregor Mendel who is not forgotten,
and it was the first hint ever uncovered for how the recipe worked.
Anyone who knows anything about blood science would recognize that
pattern in an instant. It wouldn't be exact, any more than if you
flip a coin twice forty times you'll always get exactly ten pairs
of two heads. But if it's seven or thirteen wizards out of forty
children that'll be a strong indicator. That's the test I had you
do. Now let's see your data."</p>
<p>And before Draco could even think, Harry Potter had taken the
parchment out of Draco's hand.</p>
<p>Draco's throat was very dry.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight children.</p>
<p>He wasn't sure of the exact number but he was pretty sure around
a fourth had been wizards.</p>
<p>"Six wizards out of twenty-eight children," Harry Potter said
after a moment. "Well, that's that, then. And first-years were
casting the same spells at the same power level eight centuries
ago, too. Your test and my test both came out the same way."</p>
<p>There was a long silence in the classroom.</p>
<p>"What now?" Draco whispered.</p>
<p>He'd never been so terrified.</p>
<p>"It's not definite yet," said Harry Potter. "My experiment
failed, remember? I need you to design another test, Draco."</p>
<p>"I, I..." Draco said. His voice was breaking. "I can't do this
Harry, it's too much for me."</p>
<p>Harry's look was fierce. "Yes you can, because you have to. I
thought about it myself, too, after I found out about the Interdict
of Merlin. Draco, is there any way of observing the strength of
magic directly? Some way that doesn't have anything to do with
wizards' blood or the spells we learn?"</p>
<p>Draco's mind was just blank.</p>
<p>"Anything that affects magic affects wizards," said Harry. "But
then we can't tell if it's the wizards or the magic. What does
magic affect that <i>isn't</i> a wizard?"</p>
<p>"Magical creatures, obviously," said Draco without even thinking
about it.</p>
<p>Harry Potter slowly smiled. "Draco, that's
<i>brilliant.</i>"</p>
<p><i>It's the sort of dumb question you'd only ask in the first
place if you'd been raised by Muggles.</i></p>
<p>Then the sickness in Draco's stomach got even worse as he
realized what it would mean if magical creatures <i>were</i>
getting weaker. They would know for certain then that magic was
fading, and there was a part of Draco that was already sure that
was exactly what they would find. He didn't want to see this, he
didn't want to know...</p>
<p>Harry Potter was already halfway to the door. "Come <i>on</i>,
Draco! There's a portrait not far from here, we'll just ask them to
go get someone old and find out right away! We're cloaked, if
someone sees us we can just run away! Let's go!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It didn't take long after that.</p>
<p>It was a wide portrait, but the three people in it were looking
rather crowded. There was a middle-aged man from the twelfth
century, dressed in black swathes of cloth; who spoke to a
sad-looking young woman from the fourteenth century, with hair that
seemed to constantly frizz about her head as if she'd been charged
up by a static spell; and she spoke to a dignified, wizened old man
from the seventeenth century with a solid gold bowtie; and him they
could understand.</p>
<p>They had asked about Dementors.</p>
<p>They had asked about phoenixes.</p>
<p>They had asked about dragons and trolls and house elves.</p>
<p>Harry had frowned, pointed out that creatures which needed the
most magic could just be dying out entirely, and had asked for the
most powerful magical creatures known.</p>
<p>There wasn't anything unfamiliar on the list, except for a
species of Dark creature called mind flayers which the translator
noted had finally been exterminated by Harold Shea, and those
didn't sound half as scary as Dementors.</p>
<p>Magical creatures were as powerful now as they'd ever been,
apparently.</p>
<p>The sickness in Draco's stomach was easing, and now he just felt
confused.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said in the middle of the old man translating a
list of all eleven powers of a beholder's eyes, "what does this
mean?"</p>
<p>Harry held up a finger and the old man finished the list.</p>
<p>Then Harry thanked all the portraits for helping - Draco, pretty
much on automatic, did so as well and more graciously - and they
headed back to the classroom.</p>
<p>And Harry brought out the original parchment with the
hypotheses, and began scribbling.</p>
<p><i><u>Observation:</u></i></p>
<p><i>Wizardry isn't as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was
founded.</i></p>
<p><i><u>Hypotheses:</u></i></p>
<p><i><u>1</u></i><i>. Magic itself is fading.<br />
<u>2</u></i><i>. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and
Squibs.<br />
<u>3</u></i><i>. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being
lost.<br />
4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something
else besides blood is making them grow up weaker.<br />
5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years
ago?)<br />
6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?
Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had
any children.)</i></p>
<p><i><u>Tests:</u></i></p>
<p><i>A. Are there spells we know but can't cast (1 or 2) or are
the lost spells no longer known (3)? <u>Result</u>: Inconclusive
due to Interdict of Merlin. No known uncastable spell, but could
simply have not been passed on.</i></p>
<p><i>B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of
spells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2,
but blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.)
<u>Result</u>: Same level of first-year spells then as now.</i></p>
<p><i>C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using
scientific knowledge of blood, will explain later. <u>Result</u>:
There's only one place in the recipe that makes you a wizard, and
either you have two papers saying 'magic' or you don't.</i></p>
<p><i>D. Are magical creatures losing their powers? Distinguishes 1
from (2 or 3). <u>Result:</u> Magical creatures seem to be as
strong as they ever were.</i></p>
<p>"A failed," said Harry Potter. "B is weak evidence for 1 over 2.
C falsifies 2. D falsifies 1. 4 was unlikely and B argues against 4
as well. 5 was unlikely and D argues against it. 6 is falsified
along with 2. That leaves 3. Interdict of Merlin or not, I didn't
actually find any known spell that couldn't be cast. So when you
add it all up, it looks like knowledge is being lost."</p>
<p>And the trap snapped shut.</p>
<p>As soon as the panic went away, as soon as Draco understood that
magic <i>wasn't</i> fading out, it took all of five seconds to
realize.</p>
<p>Draco shoved himself away from the desk and stood up so hard
that his chair skittered with a scraping noise across the floor and
fell over.</p>
<p>"So it was all just a stupid trick, then."</p>
<p>Harry Potter stared at him for a moment, still sitting. When he
spoke, his voice was quiet. "It was a fair test, Draco. If it had
come out a different way, I would have accepted it. That's not
something I would ever cheat on. Ever. I didn't look at your data
before I made my predictions. I told you up front when the
Interdict of Merlin invalidated the first experiment -"</p>
<p>"Oh," Draco said, the anger starting to come out into his voice,
"you didn't know how the whole thing was going to come out?"</p>
<p>"I didn't <i>know</i> anything you didn't know," Harry said,
still quietly. "I admit that I suspected. Hermione Granger was too
powerful, she should have been barely magical and she wasn't, how
can a Muggleborn be the best spellcaster in Hogwarts? And she's
getting the best grades on her essays too, it's too much
coincidence for one girl to be the strongest magically <i>and</i>
academically unless there's a single cause. Hermione Granger's
existence pointed to there being only one thing that makes you a
wizard, something you either have or you don't, and the power
differences coming from how much we know and how much we practice.
And there weren't different classes for purebloods and Muggleborns,
and so on. There were too many ways the world didn't look the way
it would look if you were right. But Draco, I didn't see anything
you couldn't see too. I didn't perform any tests I didn't tell you
about. I didn't cheat, Draco. I wanted us to work out the answer
together. And I never thought that magic might be fading out of the
world until you said it. It was a scary idea for me, too."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Draco said. He was working very hard to control his
voice and not just start screaming at Harry. "You claim you're not
going to run off and tell anyone else about this."</p>
<p>"Not without consulting you first," Harry said. He opened his
hands in a pleading gesture. "Draco, I'm being as nice as I can but
<i>the world turned out to just not be that way</i>."</p>
<p>"Fine. Then you and I are through. I'm going to just walk away
and forget any of this ever happened."</p>
<p>Draco spun around, feeling the burning sensation in his throat,
the sense of betrayal, and that was when he realized he really
<i>had</i> liked Harry Potter, and that thought didn't slow him
down for a moment as he strode toward the classroom door.</p>
<p>And Harry Potter's voice came, now louder, and worried:</p>
<p>"Draco... you <i>can't</i> forget. Don't you understand? That
was your sacrifice."</p>
<p>Draco stopped in midstride and turned around. "<i>What</i> are
you talking about?"</p>
<p>But there was already a freezing coldness in Draco's spine.</p>
<p>He knew even before Harry Potter said it.</p>
<p>"To become a scientist. You questioned one of your beliefs, not
just a small belief but something that had great significance to
you. You did experiments, gathered data, and the outcome proved the
belief was wrong. You saw the results and understood what they
meant." Harry Potter's voice was faltering. "Remember, Draco, you
can't sacrifice a <i>true</i> belief that way, because the
experiments will confirm it instead of falsifying it. Your
sacrifice to become a scientist was your <i>false</i> belief that
wizard blood was mixing and getting weaker."</p>
<p>"<i>That's not true!</i>" said Draco. "I didn't sacrifice the
belief. I still believe that!" His voice was getting louder, and
the chill was getting worse.</p>
<p>Harry Potter shook his head. His voice came in a whisper.
"Draco... I'm sorry, Draco, you <i>don't</i> believe it, not
anymore." Harry's voice rose again. "I'll prove it to you. Imagine
that someone tells you they're keeping a dragon in their house. You
tell them you want to see it. They say it's an invisible dragon.
You say fine, you'll listen to it move. They say it's an inaudible
dragon. You say you'll throw some cooking flour into the air and
see the outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable to
flour. And the telling thing is that they know, in <i>advance,</i>
exactly which experimental results they'll have to explain away.
They <i>know</i> everything will come out the way it does if
there's no dragon, they know in <i>advance</i> just which excuses
they'll have to make. So maybe they <i>say</i> there's a dragon.
Maybe they <i>believe</i> they believe there's a dragon, it's
called belief-in-belief. But they don't actually believe it. You
can be mistaken about what you believe, most people never realize
there's a difference between believing something and thinking it's
good to believe it." Harry Potter had risen from the desk now, and
taken a few steps toward Draco. "And Draco, you don't believe any
more in blood purism, I'll show you that you don't. If blood purism
is true, then Hermione Granger doesn't make sense, so what could
explain her? Maybe she's a wizarding orphan raised by Muggles, just
like I was? I could go to Granger and ask to see pictures of her
parents, to see if she looks like them. Would you expect her to
look different? Should we go perform that test?"</p>
<p>"They would have put her with relatives," Draco said, his voice
trembling. "They'll still look the same."</p>
<p>"You see. You already know what experimental result you'll have
to excuse. If you still believed in blood purism you would say,
sure, let's go take a look, I bet she won't look like her parents,
she's too powerful to be a real Muggleborn -"</p>
<p>"They <i>would</i> have put her with relatives!"</p>
<p>"Scientists can do tests to check for sure if someone is the
true child of a father. Granger would probably do it if I paid her
family enough. <i>She</i> wouldn't be afraid of the results. So
what do you expect that test to show? Tell me to run it and we
will. But you already know what the test will say. You'll always
know. You won't ever be able to forget. You might <i>wish</i> you
believed in blood purism, but you'll always <i>expect to see
happen</i> just exactly what would happen if there was only one
thing that made you a wizard. That was your sacrifice to become a
scientist."</p>
<p>Draco's breathing was ragged. "Do you realize <i>what you've
done?</i>" Draco surged forward and he seized Harry by the collar
of his robes. His voice rose to a scream, it sounded unbearably
loud in the closed classroom and the silence. "<i>Do you realize
what you've done?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's voice was shaky. "You had a belief. The belief was
false. I helped you see that. What's true is already so, owning up
to it doesn't make it worse -"</p>
<p>The fingers on Draco's right hand clenched into a fist and that
hand dropped down and blasted up unstoppably and punched Harry
Potter in the jaw so hard that his body went crashing back into a
desk and then to the floor.</p>
<p>"<i>Idiot!</i>" screamed Draco. "<i>Idiot! Idiot!</i>"</p>
<p>"Draco," whispered Harry from the floor, "Draco, I'm sorry, I
didn't think this would happen for months, I didn't expect you to
awaken as a scientist this quickly, I thought I would have longer
to prepare you, teach you the techniques that make it hurt less to
admit you're wrong -"</p>
<p>"What about Father?" Draco said. His voice trembled with rage.
"Were you going to prepare <i>him</i> or did you just not
<i>care</i> what happened after this?"</p>
<p>"You can't tell <i>him!</i>" Harry said, his voice rising in
alarm. "He's not a scientist! You promised, Draco!"</p>
<p>For a moment the thought of Father not knowing came as a
relief.</p>
<p>And then the real anger started to rise.</p>
<p>"So you planned for me to lie to him and tell him I still
believe," Draco said, voice shaking. "I'll always have to lie to
him, and now when I grow up I can't be a Death Eater, and I won't
even be able to tell him why not."</p>
<p>"If your father really loves you," whispered Harry from the
floor, "he'll still love you even if you don't become a Death
Eater, and it sounds like your father <i>does</i> really love you,
Draco -"</p>
<p>"<i>Your</i> stepfather is a scientist," Draco said. The words
coming out like biting knives. "If <i>you</i> weren't going to be a
scientist, he would still love you. But you'd be a <i>little less
special</i> to him."</p>
<p>Harry flinched. The boy opened his mouth, as if to say 'I'm
sorry', and then closed his mouth, seeming to think better of it,
which was either very smart of him or very lucky, because Draco
might have tried to kill him.</p>
<p>"You should have warned me," Draco said. His voice rose. "<i>You
should have warned me!</i>"</p>
<p>"I... I did... every time I told you about the power, I told you
about the price. I said, you have to admit you're wrong. I said
this would be the hardest path for you. That this was the sacrifice
anyone had to make to become a scientist. I said, what if the
experiment says one thing and your family and friends say another
-"</p>
<p>"<i>You call that a warning?</i>" Draco was screaming now.
"<i>You call that a warning? When we're doing a ritual that calls
for a permanent sacrifice?</i>"</p>
<p>"I... I..." The boy on the floor swallowed. "I guess maybe it
wasn't clear. I'm sorry. But that which can be destroyed by the
truth should be."</p>
<p>Hitting him wasn't enough.</p>
<p>"You're wrong about one thing," Draco said, his voice deadly.
"Granger isn't the strongest student in Hogwarts. She just gets the
best grades in class. You're about to find out the difference."</p>
<p>Sudden shock showed in Harry's face, and he tried to roll
quickly to his feet -</p>
<p>It was already too late for him.</p>
<p>"<i>Expelliarmus!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's wand flew across the room.</p>
<p>"<i>Gom jabbar!</i>"</p>
<p>A pulse of inky blackness struck Harry's left hand.</p>
<p>"That's a torture spell," said Draco. "It's for getting
information out of people. I'm just going to leave it on you and
lock the door behind me when I go. Maybe I'll set the locking spell
to wear off after a few hours. Maybe it won't wear off until you
die in here. Have fun."</p>
<p>Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still on Harry. Draco's hand
dipped down, picked up his bookbag, without his aim wavering.</p>
<p>The pain was already showing in Harry Potter's face as he spoke.
"Malfoys are above the underage magic laws, I take it? It's not
because your blood is stronger. It's because you already practiced.
In the beginning you were as weak as any of us. Is my prediction
wrong?"</p>
<p>Draco's hand whitened on his wand, but his aim stayed
steady.</p>
<p>"Just so you know," Harry said through gritted teeth, "if you'd
told me I was wrong I would have listened. <i>I</i> won't ever
torture <i>you</i> when you show me that I'm wrong. And you
<i>will</i>. Someday. You're awakened as a scientist now, and even
if you never learn to use your power, you'll always," Harry gasped,
"be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs -"</p>
<p>Draco's backing away was less smooth, now, a little faster, and
he had to work to keep his wand on Harry as he reached back to open
the door and stepped back out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Then Draco shut the door again.</p>
<p>He cast the most powerful locking Charm he knew.</p>
<p>Draco waited until he heard Harry's first scream before casting
the <i>Quietus.</i></p>
<p>And then he walked away.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Aaahhhhh! Finite Incantatem! Aaaahhh!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's left hand had been put into a pot of boiling cooking oil
and left there. He'd put everything he had into the <i>Finite
Incantatem</i> and it still wasn't working.</p>
<p>Some hexes required specific counters or you couldn't undo them,
or maybe it was just that Draco was that much stronger.</p>
<p>"<i>Aaaaahhhh!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's hand was really starting to hurt, now, and that was
interfering with his attempts to think creatively.</p>
<p>But a few screams later, Harry realized what he had to do.</p>
<p>His pouch, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of his body, and
it took some twisting to reach into it, especially with his other
arm flailing around in a reflex, unstoppable attempt to fling off
the source of pain. By the time he managed it his other arm had
managed to throw away his wand again.</p>
<p>"Medical <i>ahhhhh</i> kit! Medical kit!"</p>
<p>On the floor, the green light was too dim to see by.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't stand. He couldn't crawl. He rolled across the
floor to where he thought his wand was, and it wasn't there, and
with one hand he managed to raise himself high enough to see his
wand, and he rolled there, and got the wand, and rolled back to
where the medical kit was opened. There was also a good deal of
screaming, and a bit of throwing up.</p>
<p>It took eight tries before Harry could cast <i>Lumos.</i></p>
<p>And then, well, the package wasn't designed to be opened
one-handed, because all wizards were idiots, that was why. Harry
had to use his teeth and so it took a while before Harry finally
managed to wrap the Numbcloth over his left hand.</p>
<p>When all feeling in his left hand was finally gone, Harry let
his mind come apart, and lay motionless on the floor, and cried for
a while.</p>
<p><i>Well,</i> Harry's mind said silently into itself, when it had
recovered enough to think in words again. <i>Was it worth
it?</i></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry's functional hand reached up to a desk.</p>
<p>Harry pulled himself to his feet.</p>
<p>Took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Exhaled.</p>
<p>Smiled.</p>
<p>It wasn't much of a smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Professor Quirrell, I couldn't have lost without
you.</i></p>
<p>He hadn't redeemed Draco yet, not even close. Contrary to what
Draco himself might now believe, Draco was still the child of a
Death Eater, through and through. Still a boy who'd grown up
thinking "rape" was something the cool older kids did. But it was
one heck of a start.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't claim it had all gone just as planned. It had all
gone just as completely made up on the spot. The <i>plan</i> hadn't
called for this to happen until December or thereabouts, after
Harry had taught Draco the techniques not to deny the evidence when
he saw it.</p>
<p>But he'd seen the look of fear on Draco's face, realized that
Draco was <i>already</i> taking an alternative hypothesis
seriously, and seized the moment. One case of true curiosity had
the same sort of redeeming power in rationality that one case of
true love had in movies.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Harry had given himself hours to make the most
important discovery in the history of magic, and months to break
through the undeveloped mental barriers of an eleven-year-old boy.
This could indicate that Harry had some sort of major cognitive
deficit with respect to estimating task completion times.</p>
<p>Was Harry going to Science Hell for what he'd done? Harry wasn't
sure. He'd contrived to keep Draco's mind on the possibility that
magic was fading, made sure Draco would carry out the part of the
experiment that would seem at first to point in that direction.
He'd waited until after explaining genetics to prompt Draco into
realizing about magical creatures (though Harry had thought in
terms of ancient artifacts like the Sorting Hat, which no one could
duplicate anymore, but which continued to function). But Harry
hadn't actually exaggerated any evidence, hadn't distorted the
meaning of any results. When the Interdict of Merlin had
invalidated the test that should have been definitive, he'd told
Draco up front.</p>
<p>And then there was the part <i>after</i> that...</p>
<p>But he hadn't actually <i>lied</i> to Draco. Draco had believed
it, and <i>that would make it true.</i></p>
<p>The end, admittedly, had not been fun.</p>
<p>Harry turned, and staggered toward the door.</p>
<p>Time to test Draco's locking spell.</p>
<p>The first step was simply trying to turn the doorknob. Draco
could have been bluffing.</p>
<p>Draco hadn't been bluffing.</p>
<p>"<i>Finite Incantatem.</i>" Harry's voice came out rather
hoarse, and he could feel that the spell hadn't taken.</p>
<p>So Harry tried it again, and that time it felt true. But another
twist at the doorknob showed it hadn't worked. No surprise
there.</p>
<p>Time to bring out the big guns. Harry drew a deep breath. This
spell was one of the most powerful he'd learned so far.</p>
<p>"<i>Alohomora!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry staggered a little after saying it.</p>
<p>And the classroom door still didn't open.</p>
<p>That shocked Harry. Harry hadn't been planning to go anywhere
near Dumbledore's forbidden corridor, of course. But a spell to
open magical locks had seemed like a useful sort of spell anyway,
and so Harry had learned it. Was Dumbledore's forbidden corridor
meant to lure people so stupid that they didn't notice the security
was worse than what Draco Malfoy could put on it?</p>
<p>Fear was creeping back into Harry's system. The placard in the
medical kit had said the Numbcloth could only safely be used for up
to thirty minutes. After that it would come off automatically, and
not be reusable for 24 hours. Right now it was 6:51pm. He'd put on
the Numbcloth about five minutes ago.</p>
<p>So Harry took a step back, and considered the door. It was a
solid panel of dark oaken wood, interrupted only by the brass metal
doorknob.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know any explosive or cutting or smashing spells,
and Transfiguring explosive would have violated the rule against
Transfiguring things to be burned. Acid was a liquid and would have
made fumes...</p>
<p>But that was no obstacle to a <i>creative thinker.</i></p>
<p>Harry laid his wand against one of the door's brass hinges, and
concentrated on the form of cotton as a pure abstraction apart from
any material cotton, and also on the pure material apart from the
pattern that made it a brass hinge, and brought the two concepts
together, imposing shape on substance. An hour of Transfiguration
practice every day for a month had gotten Harry to the point where
he could Transfigure a subject of five cubic centimeters in just
under a minute.</p>
<p>After two minutes the hinge hadn't changed at all.</p>
<p>Whoever had designed Draco's locking spell, they'd thought of
that, too. Or the door was part of Hogwarts and the castle was
immune.</p>
<p>A glance showed the walls to be solid stone. So was the floor.
So was the ceiling. You couldn't separately Transfigure a part of
something that was a solid whole; Harry would have needed to try
Transfiguring the whole wall, which would have taken hours or maybe
days of continuous effort, if he could have done it at all, and if
the wall wasn't contiguous with the rest of the whole castle...</p>
<p>Harry's Time-Turner wouldn't open until 9pm. After that he could
go back to 6pm, before the door was locked.</p>
<p>How long would the torture spell last?</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard. Tears were coming into his eyes again.</p>
<p>His brilliantly creative mind had just offered the ingenious
suggestion that Harry could cut his hand off using the hacksaw in
the toolset stored in his pouch, which would hurt, obviously, but
might hurt a lot less than Draco's pain spell, since the nerves
would be gone; and he had tourniquets in the healer's kit.</p>
<p>And that was obviously a hideously stupid idea that Harry would
regret the rest of his entire life.</p>
<p>But Harry didn't know if he could hold out for two hours under
torture.</p>
<p>He wanted <i>out</i> of this classroom, he wanted out of this
classroom <i>now,</i> he didn't want to wait in here screaming for
two hours until he could use the Time-Turner, he needed to <i>get
out</i> and find someone to get the torture spell off his
hand...</p>
<p><i>Think!</i> Harry screamed at his brain. <i>Think!
Think!</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Slytherin dorm was mostly empty. People were at dinner. For
some reason Draco himself wasn't feeling very hungry.</p>
<p>Draco closed the door to his private room, locked it, Charmed it
shut, Quieted it, sat down on his bed, and started to cry.</p>
<p>It wasn't fair.</p>
<p>It wasn't fair.</p>
<p>It was the first time Draco had ever really <i>lost</i> before,
Father had warned him that losing for real would hurt the first
time it happened, but he'd lost <i>so much</i>, it wasn't fair, it
wasn't fair for him to lose <i>everything</i> the very first time
he lost.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the dungeons, a boy Draco had actually liked was
screaming in pain. Draco had never hurt anyone he'd liked before.
Punishing people who deserved it was supposed to be fun, but this
just felt sick inside. Father hadn't warned him about that, and
Draco wondered if it was a hard lesson everyone had to learn when
they grew up, or if Draco was just weak.</p>
<p>Draco wished it were Pansy screaming. That would have felt
better.</p>
<p>And the worst part was knowing that it might have been a mistake
to hurt Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Who else was there for Draco now? Dumbledore? After what he'd
done? Draco would sooner have been burned alive.</p>
<p>Draco would have to go back to Harry Potter because there was
nowhere else for him to go. And if Harry Potter said he didn't want
him, then Draco would be nothing, just a pathetic little boy who
could never be a Death Eater, never join Dumbledore's faction,
never learn science.</p>
<p>The trap had been perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father had
warned Draco over and over that what you sacrificed to Dark rituals
couldn't be regained. But Father hadn't known that the accursed
Muggles had invented rituals that didn't need wands, rituals you
could be tricked into doing without knowing it, and that was only
one of the terrible secrets which scientists knew and which Harry
Potter had brought with him.</p>
<p>Draco started crying harder, then.</p>
<p>He didn't want this, he <i>didn't want this</i> but there was no
turning back. It was too late. He was already a scientist.</p>
<p>Draco knew he should go back and free Harry Potter and
apologize. It would have been the smart thing to do.</p>
<p>Instead Draco stayed in his bed and sobbed.</p>
<p>He'd already hurt Harry Potter. It might be the only time Draco
ever got to hurt him, and he would have to hold to that one memory
for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Let him keep screaming.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry dropped the remnants of his hacksaw to the ground. The
brass hinges had proved impervious, not even scratched, and Harry
was beginning to suspect that even the desperation act of trying to
Transfigure acid or explosives would have failed to open this door.
On the plus side, the attempt had destroyed the hacksaw.</p>
<p>His watch said it was 7:02pm, with less than fifteen minutes
left, and Harry tried to remember if there were any other sharp
things in his pouch that needed destroying, and felt another fit of
tears welling up. If only, when his Time-Turner opened, he could go
back and <i>prevent</i> -</p>
<p>And that was when Harry realized he was being <i>silly</i>.</p>
<p>It wasn't the first time he'd been locked in a room.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had already told him the correct way to do
this.</p>
<p>...she'd also told him not to use the Time-Turner for this sort
of thing.</p>
<p>Would Professor McGonagall realize that this occasion really
<i>did</i> warrant a special exception? Or just take away the
Time-Turner entirely?</p>
<p>Harry gathered up all his things, all the evidence, into his
pouch. A <i>Scourgify</i> took care of the vomit on the floor,
though not the sweat that had soaked his robes. He left the
overturned desks overturned, it wasn't important enough to be worth
doing with one hand.</p>
<p>When he was done, Harry glanced down at his watch. 7:04pm.</p>
<p>And then Harry waited. Seconds passed, feeling like years.</p>
<p>At 7:07pm, the door opened.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick's puff-bearded face looked rather concerned.
"Are you all right, Harry?" said the squeaky voice of Ravenclaw's
Head of House. "I got a note saying you'd been locked in here

<p><i>Act 3:</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco waited in a small windowed alcove he'd found near the
Great Hall, stomach churning.</p>
<p>There would be a price, and it would not be small. Draco had
known that as soon as he'd woken up and realized that he didn't
dare enter the Great Hall for breakfast because he might see Harry
Potter there and Draco didn't know what would happen after
that.</p>
<p>Footsteps approached.</p>
<p>"Here ya go," said Vincent's voice. "Now da boss ain't in a good
mood today, so ya'd better watch your step."</p>
<p>Draco was going to skin that idiot alive and send back the
flayed body with a request for a more intelligent servant, like a
dead gerbil.</p>
<p>One set of footsteps went off, and the other set of footsteps
came closer.</p>
<p>The churning in Draco's stomach got worse.</p>
<p>Harry Potter came into sight. His face was carefully neutral,
but his blue-trimmed robes looked oddly askew, as if they hadn't
been put on quite right -</p>
<p>"<i>Your hand,</i>" Draco said without thinking about it at
all.</p>
<p>Harry raised his left arm, as though to look at it himself.</p>
<p>The hand dangled limply from it, like something dead.</p>
<p>"Madam Pomfrey said it's not permanent," Harry said quietly.
"She said it should mostly recover by the time classes start
tomorrow."</p>
<p>For a single instant the news came as a relief.</p>
<p>And then Draco realized.</p>
<p>"You went to Madam Pomfrey," whispered Draco.</p>
<p>"Of course I did," said Harry Potter, as though stating the
obvious. "My hand wasn't working."</p>
<p>It was slowly dawning on Draco what an <i>absolute</i> fool he'd
been, far worse than the older Slytherins he'd chewed out.</p>
<p>He'd just taken for granted that no one would go to the
authorities when a Malfoy did something to them. That no one would
want Lucius Malfoy's eye on them, ever.</p>
<p>But Harry Potter wasn't a frightened little Hufflepuff trying to
stay out of the game. He was already playing it, and Father's eye
was already on him.</p>
<p>"What else did Madam Pomfrey say?" said Draco, his heart in his
throat.</p>
<p>"Professor Flitwick said that the spell cast on my hand had been
a Dark torture hex and extremely serious business, and that
refusing to say who did it was absolutely unacceptable."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"And then?" Draco said in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>Harry Potter smiled slightly. "I apologized deeply, which made
Professor Flitwick look <i>very</i> stern, and then I told
Professor Flitwick that the whole thing was, indeed, extremely
serious, secret, <i>delicate</i> business, and that I'd already
informed the Headmaster about the project."</p>
<p>Draco gasped. "No! Flitwick isn't going to just accept that!
He'll check with Dumbledore!"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Harry Potter. "I was promptly hauled off to the
Headmaster's office."</p>
<p>Draco was trembling now. If Dumbledore brought Harry Potter
before the Wizengamot, willingly or otherwise, and had the
Boy-Who-Lived testify under Veritaserum that Draco had tortured
him... too many people loved Harry Potter, Father could <i>lose</i>
that vote...</p>
<p>Father might be able to convince Dumbledore not to do that, but
it would <i>cost.</i> Cost terribly. The game had rules now, you
couldn't just threaten someone at random any more. But Draco had
walked into Dumbledore's hands of his own free will. And Draco was
a very valuable hostage.</p>
<p>Though since Draco couldn't be a Death Eater now, he wasn't as
valuable as Father thought.</p>
<p>The thought tore at his heart like a Cutting Charm.</p>
<p>"Then what?" whispered Draco.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore deduced immediately that it was you. He knew we'd
been associating."</p>
<p>The worst possible scenario. If Dumbledore hadn't guessed who
did it, he might not have risked using Legilimency just to find
out... but if Dumbledore <i>knew...</i></p>
<p>"And?" Draco forced out the word.</p>
<p>"We had a little chat."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter grinned. "And I explained that it would be in his
best interest not to do anything."</p>
<p>Draco's mind ran into a brick wall and splattered. He just
stared at Harry Potter with his mouth hanging slack like a
fool.</p>
<p>It took that long for Draco to remember.</p>
<p>Harry knew Dumbledore's mysterious secret, the one Snape used as
his hold.</p>
<p>Draco could just see it now. Dumbledore looking all stern,
concealing his eagerness as he explained to Harry what a terribly
serious matter this was.</p>
<p>And Harry politely telling Dumbledore to keep his mouth shut if
he knew what was good for him.</p>
<p>Father had warned Draco against people like this, people who
could ruin you and still be so likable that it was hard to hate
them properly.</p>
<p>"After which," Harry said, "the Headmaster told Professor
Flitwick that this was, indeed, a secret and delicate matter of
which he had already been informed, and that he did not think
pressing it at this time would help me or anyone. Professor
Flitwick started to say something about the Headmaster's usual
plotting going much too far, and I had to interrupt at that point
and explain that it had been my <i>own</i> idea and not anything
the Headmaster forced me into, so Professor Flitwick spun around
and started lecturing <i>me</i>, and the Headmaster interrupted
<i>him</i> and said that as the Boy-Who-Lived I was doomed to have
weird and dangerous adventures so I was safer if I got into them on
purpose instead of waiting for them to happen by accident, and that
was when Professor Flitwick threw up his little hands and started
shrieking in a high-pitched voice at <i>both</i> of us about how he
didn't care what we were cooking up together, but this wasn't ever
to happen again for as long as I was in Ravenclaw House or he would
have me thrown out and I could go to Gryffindor which was where all
this <i>Dumbledoring</i> belonged -"</p>
<p>Harry was making it <i>very</i> hard for Draco to hate him.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said, "I didn't want to be thrown out of
Ravenclaw, so I promised Professor Flitwick that nothing like this
would happen again, and if it did, I would just tell him who did
it."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes should have been cold. They weren't. The voice
should have made it a deadly threat. It wasn't.</p>
<p>And Draco saw the question that should have been obvious, and it
killed the mood in an instant.</p>
<p>"Why... didn't you?"</p>
<p>Harry walked over to the window, into the small beam of sunlight
shining into the alcove, and turned his head outward, toward the
green grounds of Hogwarts. The brightness shone on him, on his
robes, on his face.</p>
<p>"Why didn't I?" Harry said. His voice caught. "I guess because I
just couldn't get angry at you. I knew I'd hurt you first. I won't
even call it fair, because what I did to you was worse than what
you did to me."</p>
<p>It was like running into another brick wall. Harry could have
been speaking archaic Greek for all Draco understood him then.</p>
<p>Draco's mind scrabbled for patterns and came up flat blank. The
statement was a concession that hadn't been in Harry's best
interests. It wasn't even what Harry should say to make Draco a
more loyal servant, now that Harry held power over him. For that
Harry should be emphasizing how kindly he'd been, not how much he'd
hurt Draco.</p>
<p>"Even so," Harry said, and now his voice was lower, almost a
whisper, "please don't do that again, Draco. It hurt, and I'm not
sure I could forgive you a second time. I'm not sure I'd be able to
want to."</p>
<p>Draco just didn't get it.</p>
<p>Was Harry trying to be <i>friends</i> with him?</p>
<p>There was no way Harry Potter could be dumb enough to believe
that was still possible after what he'd done.</p>
<p>You could be someone's friend and ally, like Draco had tried to
do with Harry, or you could destroy their life and leave them no
other options. Not both.</p>
<p>But then Draco didn't understand what else Harry <i>could</i> be
trying.</p>
<p>And a strange thought came to Draco then, something Harry had
kept talking about yesterday.</p>
<p>And the thought was: <i>Test it.</i></p>
<p><i>You're awakened as a scientist now,</i> Harry had said,
<i>and even if you never learn to use your power, you'll always, be
looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs...</i> Those ominous
words, spoken in gasps of agony, had kept running through Draco's
mind.</p>
<p>If Harry <i>was</i> pretending to be the repentant friend who
had accidentally hurt someone...</p>
<p>"You <i>planned</i> what you did to me!" Draco said, managing to
put a note of accusation in his voice. "You didn't do it because
you got angry, you did it because you <i>wanted</i> to!"</p>
<p><i>Fool,</i> Harry Potter would say, <i>of course I planned it,
and now you're mine -</i></p>
<p>Harry turned back toward Draco. "What happened yesterday
<i>wasn't</i> the plan," Harry said, his voice seeming stuck in his
throat. "The <i>plan</i> was that I would teach you why you were
always better off knowing the truth, and then we would try together
to discover the truth about blood, and whatever the answer was we
would accept it. Yesterday I... rushed things."</p>
<p>"Always better off knowing the truth," Draco said coldly. "Like
you did me a <i>favor.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, blowing Draco's mind completely, and said, "What
if Lucius comes up with the same idea I did, that the problem is
stronger wizards having fewer children? He might start a program to
pay the strongest purebloods to have more children. In fact, if
blood purism <i>were</i> right, that's just what Lucius
<i>should</i> be doing - addressing the problem on <i>his</i> side,
where he can make things happen right away. Right now, Draco,
you're the only friend Lucius has who would try to stop him from
wasting the effort, because you're the only one who knows the
<i>real</i> truth and can predict the real results."</p>
<p>The thought came to Draco that Harry Potter had been raised in a
place so strange that he was now effectively a magical creature
rather than a wizard. Draco simply couldn't guess what Harry would
say or do next.</p>
<p>"<i>Why?</i>" Draco said. Putting pain and betrayal into his
voice wasn't hard at all. "Why did you <i>do</i> this to me? What
<i>was</i> your plan?"</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, "you're Lucius's heir, and believe it or
not, Dumbledore thinks I belong to him. So we could grow up and
fight their battles with each other. Or we could do something
else."</p>
<p>Slowly, Draco's mind wrapped around this. "You want to provoke a
fight to the finish between them, then seize power after they're
both exhausted." Draco felt cold dread in his chest. He would
<i>have</i> to try and stop that no matter the cost to himself
-</p>
<p>But Harry shook his head. "Stars above, <i>no!</i>"</p>
<p>"No...?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't go along with that and neither would I," said
Harry. "This is <i>our</i> world, we don't want to break it. But
imagine, say, Lucius thought the Conspiracy was your tool and you
were on his side, Dumbledore thought the Conspiracy was my tool and
I was on his side, Lucius thought that you'd turned me and
Dumbledore believed the Conspiracy was mine, Dumbledore thought
that I'd turned you and Lucius believed the Conspiracy was yours,
and so they both helped us out but only in ways that the other one
wouldn't notice."</p>
<p>Draco did not have to fake being speechless.</p>
<p>Father had once taken him to see a play called <i>The Tragedy of
Light</i>, about this <i>incredibly</i> clever Slytherin named
Light who'd set out to purify the world of evil using an ancient
ring that could kill anyone whose name and face he knew, and who'd
been opposed by another incredibly clever Slytherin, a villain
named Lawliet, who'd worn a disguise to conceal his true face; and
Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts, especially in
the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and Draco had been
hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed out that the word
'Tragedy' was right there in the title.</p>
<p>Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had
gone to see this play.</p>
<p>Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and
Lawliet when he grew up.</p>
<p>Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and
pointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face
there had been no good reason for him to tell Light his
<i>name</i>. Father had then gone on to demolish almost every part
of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes growing wider and
wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this were
<i>always</i> unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what
someone <i>actually</i> as smart as Light would <i>actually</i> do,
the playwright would have tried to take over the world himself
instead of just writing plays about it.</p>
<p>That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three,
which was that any plot which required more than three different
things to happen would never work in real life.</p>
<p>Father had <i>further</i> explained that since only a fool would
attempt a plot that was <i>as complicated as possible</i>, the real
limit was two.</p>
<p>Draco couldn't even find words to describe the sheer gargantuan
unworkability of Harry's master plan.</p>
<p>But it was <i>just</i> the sort of mistake you would make if you
didn't have any mentors and thought you were clever and had learned
about plotting by watching plays.</p>
<p>"So," said Harry, "what do you think of the plan?"</p>
<p>"It's clever..." Draco said slowly. Shouting <i>brilliant!</i>
and gasping in awe would have looked too suspicious. "Harry, can I
ask a question?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Why did you buy Granger an expensive pouch?"</p>
<p>"To show no hard feelings," said Harry at once. "Though I expect
she'll also feel awkward if she refuses any small requests I make
over the next couple of months."</p>
<p>And that was when Draco realized that Harry actually <i>was</i>
trying to be his friend.</p>
<p>Harry's move against Granger <i>had</i> been smart, maybe even
brilliant. Make your enemy not suspect you, <i>and</i> put them
into your debt in a friendly way so that you could maneuver them
into position <i>just by asking them</i>. Draco couldn't have
gotten away with that, his target would have been too suspicious,
but the Boy-Who-Lived <i>could.</i> So the first step of Harry's
plot was to give his enemy an expensive present, Draco wouldn't
have thought of that, but it could <i>work...</i><i><br /></i></p>
<p>If you were Harry's enemy, his plots might be hard to see
through at first, they might even be stupid, but his reasoning
would make <i>sense</i> once you understood it, you would
comprehend that he was trying to hurt you.</p>
<p>The way Harry was acting toward Draco right now did <i>not</i>
make sense.</p>
<p>Because if you were Harry's <i>friend,</i> then he tried to be
friends with you in the alien, incomprehensible way he'd been
raised by Muggles to do, even if it meant destroying your entire
life.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"I know that I've abused our friendship terribly," Harry said
finally. "But please realize, Draco, that in the end, I just wanted
the two of us to find the truth together. Is that something you can
forgive?"</p>
<p>A fork with two paths, but with only one path easy to go back on
later if Draco changed his mind...</p>
<p>"I guess I understand what you were trying to do," Draco lied,
"so yes."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes lit up. "I'm glad to hear that, Draco," he said
softly.</p>
<p>The two students stood in that alcove, Harry still dipped in the
lone sunbeam, Draco in shadow.</p>
<p>And Draco realized with a note of horror and despair, that
although it was a terrifying fate indeed to be Harry's friend,
Harry now had so many different avenues for threatening Draco that
being his enemy would be even <i>worse</i>.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Well, he could always switch to being enemies later...</p>
<p>He was doomed.</p>
<p>"So," Draco said. "Now what?"</p>
<p>"We study again next Saturday?"</p>
<p>"It better not go like the last one -"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it won't," said Harry. "A few more Saturdays like
<i>that</i> and you'd be ahead of <i>me.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry laughed. Draco didn't.</p>
<p>"Oh, and before you go," Harry said, and grinned sheepishly. "I
know this is a bad time, but I wanted to ask you for advice about
something, actually."</p>
<p>"Okay," Draco said, still a bit distracted by that last
statement.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes grew intent. "Buying that pouch for Granger used up
most of the gold I managed to steal from my Gringotts vault -"</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>"- and McGonagall has the vault key, or Dumbledore does now,
maybe. And I was just about to launch a plot that might take some
money, so I was wondering if you know how I can get access -"</p>
<p>"I'll loan you the money," said Draco's mouth in sheer
existential reflex.</p>
<p>Harry looked taken aback, but in a pleased way. "Draco, you
don't have to -"</p>
<p>"How much?"</p>
<p>Harry named the amount and Draco couldn't quite keep the shock
from showing on his face. That was almost all the spending money
Father had given Draco to last out the whole year, Draco would be
left with just a few Galleons -</p>
<p>Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write
Father and explain that the money was gone because he had managed
to <i>loan it to Harry Potter,</i> and Father would send him a
special congratulatory note written in golden ink, a giant
Chocolate Frog that would take two weeks to eat, and ten times as
many Galleons just in case Harry Potter needed another loan.</p>
<p>"It's way too much, isn't it," said Harry. "I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have asked -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, I <i>am</i> a Malfoy, you know," said Draco. "I was
just surprised you <i>wanted</i> that much."</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Harry Potter said cheerfully. "It's nothing that
threatens your family's interests, just me being evil."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "No problem, then. You want to go get it right
now?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Harry.</p>
<p>As they left the alcove and started heading toward the dungeons,
Draco couldn't help but ask, "So <i>can</i> you tell me which plot
this is for?"</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter."</p>
<p>Draco thought some very bad words to himself, but it was far too
late to say no.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>By the time they'd reached the dungeons, Draco had started
pulling together his thoughts again.</p>
<p>He <i>was</i> having trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry
<i>had</i> been trying to be friendly, he was just insane.</p>
<p>And that wasn't going to stop Draco's revenge or even slow it
down.</p>
<p>"So," Draco said, after looking around to make certain no one
was nearby. Their voices would both be Blurred, of course, but it
never hurt to be extra sure. "I've been thinking. When we bring new
recruits into the Conspiracy, they're going to have to <i>think</i>
we're equals. Otherwise it would only take <i>one</i> of them to
blow the plot to Father. You already worked that out, right?"</p>
<p>"Naturally," said Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i> we be equals?" said Draco.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Harry said. It was clear that he was trying to
sound gentle, and also clear that he was trying to suppress a good
deal of condescension and not quite succeeding. "I'm sorry, Draco,
but you don't even know what the word <i>Bayesian</i> in
<i>Bayesian Conspiracy</i> means right now. You're going to have to
study for months before we take anyone else in, just so you can put
up a <i>good front</i>."</p>
<p>"Because I don't know enough science," Draco said, carefully
keeping his voice neutral.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head at that. "The problem isn't that you're
ignorant of specific science things like deoxyribose nucleic acid.
<i>That</i> wouldn't stop you from being my equal. The problem is
that you aren't trained in the methods of rationality, the
<i>deeper</i> secret knowledge behind how all those discoveries got
made in the first place. I'll <i>try</i> to teach you those, but
they're a lot harder to learn. Think of what we did yesterday,
Draco. Yes, you did some of the work. But I was the only one in
control. You answered some of the questions. I asked all of them.
You helped push. I did the steering by myself. And without the
methods of rationality, Draco, you can't possibly steer the
Conspiracy where it needs to go."</p>
<p>"I see," said Draco, his voice sounding disappointed.</p>
<p>Harry's voice tried to gentle itself even more. "I'll try to
respect your expertise, Draco, about things like people stuff. But
you need to respect my expertise too, and there's just no
<i>way</i> you could be my equal when it comes to steering the
Conspiracy. You've only been a scientist for <i>one day</i>, you
know <i>one</i> secret about deoxyribose nucleic acid, and you
aren't trained in <i>any</i> of the methods of rationality."</p>
<p>"I understand," said Draco.</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p><i>People stuff,</i> Harry had said. Seizing control of the
Conspiracy probably wouldn't even be difficult. And afterward, he
would kill Harry Potter just to be sure -</p>
<p>The memory rose up in Draco of how sick inside it had felt last
night, knowing Harry was screaming.</p>
<p>Draco thought some more bad words.</p>
<p>Fine. He <i>wouldn't</i> kill Harry. Harry had been raised by
Muggles, it wasn't his fault he was insane.</p>
<p>Instead, Harry would live on, just so that Draco could tell him
that it had all been for Harry's own good, really, he ought to be
grateful -</p>
<p>And with a sudden twitch of surprised pleasure, Draco realized
that it actually <i>was</i> for Harry's own good. If Harry tried to
carry out his plan of playing Dumbledore and Father for fools, he
would <i>die.</i></p>
<p>That made it <i>perfect.</i></p>
<p>Draco would take all of Harry's dreams away from him, just as
Harry had done to him.</p>
<p>Draco would tell Harry that it had been for his own good, and it
would be absolutely true.</p>
<p>Draco would wield the Conspiracy and the power of science to
purify the wizarding world, and Father would be as proud of him as
if he'd been a Death Eater.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's evil plots would be foiled, and the forces of
right would prevail.</p>
<p>The perfect revenge.</p>
<p>Unless...</p>
<p><i>Just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist,</i> Harry
had told him.</p>
<p>Draco didn't have words to describe exactly what was wrong with
Harry's mind -</p>
<p>(since Draco had never heard the term <i>depth of
recursion</i>)</p>
<p>- but he could guess what sort of plots it implied.</p>
<p>...unless all that was exactly what Harry <i>wanted</i> Draco to
do as part of some even <i>larger</i> plot which Draco would play
<i>right into</i> by trying to foil this one, Harry might even
<i>know</i> that his plan was unworkable, it might have no purpose
<i>except</i> luring Draco to thwart it -</p>
<p>No. That way lay <i>madness.</i> There <i>had</i> to be a limit.
The Dark Lord himself hadn't been <i>that</i> twisty. That sort of
thing didn't happen in real life, only in Father's silly bedtime
stories about foolish gargoyles who always ended up furthering the
hero's plans every time they tried to stop him.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>And beside Draco, Harry walked along with a smile on his face,
thinking about the evolutionary origins of human intelligence.</p>
<p>In the beginning, before people had quite understood how
evolution worked, they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like
<i>human intelligence evolved so that we could invent better
tools.</i></p>
<p>The reason why this was crazy was that only one person in the
tribe had to invent a tool, and then everyone else would use it,
and it would spread to other tribes, and still be used by their
descendants a hundred years later. That was great from the
perspective of scientific progress, but in evolutionary terms, it
meant that the person who invented something didn't have much of a
fitness <i>advantage</i>, didn't have all that many <i>more</i>
children than everyone else. Only <i>relative</i> fitness
advantages could increase the relative frequency of a gene in the
population, and drive some lonely mutation to the point where it
was universal and everyone had it. And brilliant inventions just
weren't common enough to provide the sort of consistent selection
pressure it took to promote a mutation. It was a natural guess, if
you looked at humans with their guns and tanks and nuclear weapons
and compared them to chimpanzees, that the intelligence was there
to make the technology. A natural guess, but wrong.</p>
<p>Before people had quite understood how evolution worked, they'd
gone around thinking crazy ideas like <i>the climate changed, and
tribes had to migrate, and people had to become smarter in order to
solve all the novel problems.</i></p>
<p>But human beings had four times the brain size of a chimpanzee.
20% of a human's metabolic energy went into feeding the brain.
Humans were <i>ridiculously</i> smarter than any other species.
That sort of thing didn't happen because the environment stepped up
the difficulty of its problems a little. Then the organisms would
just get a little smarter to solve them. Ending up with that
gigantic outsized brain must have taken some sort of <i>runaway</i>
evolutionary process, something that would push and push without
limits.</p>
<p>And today's scientists had a pretty good guess at what that
runaway evolutionary process had been.</p>
<p>Harry had once read a famous book called <i>Chimpanzee
Politics.</i> The book had described how an adult chimpanzee named
Luit had confronted the aging alpha, Yeroen, with the help of a
young, recently matured chimpanzee named Nikkie. Nikkie had not
intervened directly in the fights between Luit and Yeroen, but had
prevented Yeroen's other supporters in the tribe from coming to his
aid, distracting them whenever a confrontation developed between
Luit and Yeroen. And in time Luit had won, and become the new
alpha, with Nikkie as the second most powerful...</p>
<p>...though it hadn't taken very long after that for Nikkie to
form an alliance with the defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, and
become the <i>new</i> new alpha.</p>
<p>It really made you appreciate what millions of years of hominids
trying to outwit <i>each other</i> - an evolutionary arms race
without limit - had led to in the way of increased mental
capacity.</p>
<p>'Cause, y'know, a human would have totally seen that one
coming.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing his smile as
he thought about his revenge.</p>
<p>Someday, maybe in years but someday, Harry Potter would learn
just what it meant to underestimate a Malfoy.</p>
<p>Draco had awakened as a scientist in a single day. Harry had
said that wasn't supposed to happen for months.</p>
<p>But of course if you were a Malfoy, you would be a more powerful
scientist than anyone who wasn't.</p>
<p>So Draco would learn all of Harry Potter's methods of
rationality, and then when the time was ripe -</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="25">Chapter 25</h2><h3>Hold Off on Proposing
Solutions</h3>
<p>To seek out new life, and J. K. Rowling!</p>
<p>Note: Since the science in this story is usually all correct, I
include a warning that in Ch. 22-25 Harry overlooks many
possibilities, the most important of which is that there are lots
of magical genes but they're all on one chromosome (which wouldn't
happen naturally, but the chromosome might have been engineered).
In this case, the inheritance pattern would be Mendelian, but the
magical chromosome could still be degraded by chromosomal crossover
with its nonmagical homologue. (Harry has read about Mendel and
chromosomes in science history books, but he hasn't studied enough
actual genetics to know about chromosomal crossover. Hey, he's only
eleven.) However, although a modern science journal would find a
<i>lot</i> more nits to pick, everything Harry presents as strong
evidence is in fact strong evidence - the other possibilities are
<i>improbable</i>.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Act 2:</i></p>
<p>(The sun shone brilliantly into the Great Hall from the
enchanted sky-ceiling above, illuminating the students as though
they sat beneath the naked sky, gleaming from their plates and
bowls, as, refreshed by a night's sleep, they inhaled breakfast in
preparation for whatever plans they'd made for their Sunday.)</p>
<p>So. There was only one thing that made you a wizard.</p>
<p>That wasn't surprising, when you thought about it. What DNA
mostly did was tell ribosomes how to chain amino acids together
into proteins. Conventional physics seemed quite capable of
describing amino acids, and no matter how many amino acids you
chained together, conventional physics said you would never, ever
get magic out of it.</p>
<p>And yet magic seemed to be hereditary, following DNA.</p>
<p>Then that probably <i>wasn't</i> because the DNA was chaining
together nonmagical amino acids into magical proteins.</p>
<p>Rather the key DNA sequence did not, of itself, give you your
magic at all.</p>
<p>Magic came from somewhere else.</p>
<p>(At the Ravenclaw table there was one boy who was staring off
into space, as his right hand automatically spooned some
unimportant food into his mouth from whatever was in front of him.
You probably could have substituted a pile of dirt and he wouldn't
have noticed.)</p>
<p>And for some reason the Source of Magic was paying attention to
a particular DNA marker among individuals who were ordinary
ape-descended humans in every other way.</p>
<p>(Actually there were quite a lot of boys and girls staring off
into space. It was the <i>Ravenclaw</i> table, after all.)</p>
<p>There were other lines of logic leading to the same conclusion.
<i>Complex</i> machinery was always universal within a sexually
reproducing species. If gene B relied on gene A, then A had to be
useful on its own, and rise to near-universality in the gene pool
on its own, before B would be useful often enough to confer a
fitness advantage. Then once B was universal you would get a
variant A* that relied on B, and then C that relied on A* and B,
then B* that relied on C, until the whole machine would fall apart
if you removed a single piece. But it all had to happen
<i>incrementally</i> - evolution never looked ahead, evolution
would never start promoting B in <i>preparation</i> for A becoming
universal later. Evolution was the simple historical fact that,
whichever organisms did in fact have the most children, their genes
would in fact be more frequent in the next generation. So each
piece of a complex machine had to become nearly universal before
other pieces in the machine would evolve to depend on its
presence.</p>
<p>So <i>complex, interdependent</i> machinery, the powerful
sophisticated protein machines that drove life, was always
<i>universal</i> within a sexually reproducing species - except for
a small handful of <i>non</i>-interdependent <i>variants</i> that
were being selected on at any given time, as further complexity was
slowly laid down. It was why all human beings had the same
underlying brain design, the same emotions, the same facial
expressions wired up to those emotions; those adaptations were
complex, so they <i>had</i> to be universal.</p>
<p>If magic had been like that, a big complex adaptation with lots
of necessary genes, then a wizard mating with a Muggle would have
resulted in a child with only half those parts and half the machine
wouldn't do much. And so there would have been no Muggleborns,
ever. Even if all the pieces had individually gotten into the
Muggle gene pool, they'd never reassemble all in one place to form
a wizard.</p>
<p>There hadn't been some genetically isolated valley of humans
that had stumbled onto an evolutionary pathway leading to
sophisticated magical sections of the brain. That complex genetic
machinery, if wizards interbred with Muggles, would never have
reassembled into Muggleborns.</p>
<p>So however your genes made you a wizard, it <i>wasn't</i> by
containing the blueprints for complicated machinery.</p>
<p>That was the other reason Harry had guessed the Mendelian
pattern would be there. If magical genes weren't complicated, why
would there be more than one?</p>
<p>And yet magic itself seemed pretty complicated. A door-locking
spell would prevent the door from opening <i>and</i> prevent you
from Transfiguring the hinges <i>and</i> resist <i>Finite
Incantatem</i> and <i>Alohomora</i>. Many elements all pointing in
the same direction: you could call that goal-orientation, or in
simpler language, purposefulness.</p>
<p>There were only two known causes of purposeful complexity.
Natural selection, which produced things like butterflies. And
intelligent engineering, which produced things like cars.</p>
<p>Magic didn't seem like something that had self-replicated into
existence. Spells were purposefully complicated, but not, like a
butterfly, complicated for the purpose of making copies of
themselves. Spells were complicated for the purpose of serving
their user, like a car.</p>
<p>Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of
Magic, and told it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.</p>
<p>The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with
"Atlantis".</p>
<p>Harry had asked Hermione about that earlier - on the train to
Hogwarts, after hearing Draco say it - and so far as she knew,
nothing more was known than the word itself.</p>
<p>It might have been pure legend. But it was also plausible enough
that a civilization of magic-users, especially one from
<i>before</i> the Interdict of Merlin, would have managed to blow
itself up.</p>
<p>The line of reasoning continued: Atlantis had been an isolated
civilization that had somehow brought into being the Source of
Magic, and told it to serve only people with the Atlantean genetic
marker, the blood of Atlantis.</p>
<p>And by similar logic: The words a wizard spoke, the wand
movements, those weren't complicated enough of themselves to build
up the spell effects from scratch - not the way that the three
billion base pairs of human DNA actually <i>were</i> complicated
enough to build a human body from scratch, not the way that
computer programs took up thousands of bytes of data.</p>
<p>So the words and wand movements were just triggers, levers
pulled on some hidden and more complex machine. Buttons, not
blueprints.</p>
<p>And just like a computer program wouldn't compile if you made a
single spelling error, the Source of Magic wouldn't respond to you
unless you cast your spells in exactly the right way.</p>
<p>The chain of logic was inexorable.</p>
<p>And it led inevitably toward a single final conclusion.</p>
<p>The ancient forebears of the wizards, thousands of years
earlier, had told the Source of Magic to only levitate things if
you said...</p>
<p>'Wingardium Leviosa.'</p>
<p>Harry slumped over at the breakfast table, resting his forehead
wearily on his right hand.</p>
<p>There was a story from the dawn days of Artificial Intelligence
- back when they were just starting out and no one had yet realized
the problem would be difficult - about a professor who had
delegated one of his grad students to solve the problem of computer
vision.</p>
<p>Harry was beginning to understand how that grad student must
have felt.</p>
<p>This could take a while.</p>
<p>Why did it take more effort to cast the Alohomora spell, if it
was just like pressing a button?</p>
<p>Who'd been silly enough to build in a spell for <i>Avada
Kedavra</i> that could only be cast using hatred?</p>
<p>Why did wordless Transfiguration require you to make a complete
mental separation between the concept of form and concept of
material?</p>
<p>Harry might not be done with this problem by the time he
graduated Hogwarts. He could still be working on this problem when
he was <i>thirty years old.</i> Hermione had been right, Harry
<i>hadn't</i> realized that on a gut level before. He'd just given
an inspiring speech about determination.</p>
<p>Harry's mind briefly considered whether to get on a gut level
that he might never solve the problem at all, then decided that
would be taking things much too far.</p>
<p>Besides, so long as he could get as far as immortality in the
first few decades, he'd be fine.</p>
<p>What method had the Dark Lord used? Come to think, the fact that
the Dark Lord had somehow managed to survive the death of his first
body was almost <i>infinitely</i> more important than the fact that
he'd tried to take over magical Britain -</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said an expected voice from behind him in very
unexpected tones. "At your convenience, Mr. Malfoy requests the
favor of a conversation."</p>
<p>Harry did not choke on his breakfast cereal. Instead he turned
around and beheld Mr. Crabbe.</p>
<p>"Excuse <i>me,</i>" said Harry. "Don't you mean 'Da boss wants
ta talk wid youse?'"</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe didn't look happy. "Mr. Malfoy instructed me to speak
properly."</p>
<p>"I can't hear you," Harry said. "You're not speaking properly."
He turned back to his bowl of tiny blue crystal snowflakes and
deliberately ate another spoonful.</p>
<p>"Da boss wants to talk with youse," came a threatening voice
from behind him. "Ya'd better come see him if ya know what's good
for ya."</p>
<p>There. <i>Now</i> everything was going according to plan.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Act 1:</i></p>
<p>"A <i>reason?</i>" said the old wizard. He restrained the fury
from his face. The boy before him had been the victim, and
certainly did not need to be frightened any further. "There is
<i>nothing</i> that can excuse -"</p>
<p>"What I did to him was worse."</p>
<p>The old wizard stiffened in sudden horror. "Harry, <i>what have
you done?</i>"</p>
<p>"I tricked Draco into believing that I'd tricked him into
participating in a ritual that sacrificed his belief in blood
purism. And that meant he couldn't be a Death Eater when he grew
up. He'd lost everything, Headmaster."</p>
<p>There was a long quiet in the office, broken only by the tiny
puffs and whistles of the fiddly things, which after enough time
had come to seem like silence.</p>
<p>"Dear me," said the old wizard, "I <i>do</i> feel silly. And
<i>here</i> I was expecting you might try to redeem the heir of
Malfoy by, say, <i>showing him true friendship and
kindness</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Ha!</i> Yeah, like <i>that</i> would have worked."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. This was taking it too far. "Tell me,
Harry. Did it even <i>occur</i> to you that there was something
<i>incongruous</i> about setting out to redeem someone through lies
and trickery?"</p>
<p>"I did it without telling any direct lies, and since we're
talking about Draco Malfoy here, I think the word you're looking
for is <i>congruous</i>." The boy looked rather smug.</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head in despair. "And <i>this</i> is
the hero. We're all doomed."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Act 5:</i></p>
<p>The long, narrow tunnel of rough stone, unlit except by a
child's wand, seemed to stretch on for miles.</p>
<p>The reason for this was simple: It <i>did</i> stretch on for
miles.</p>
<p>The time was three in the morning, and Fred and George were
starting the long way down the secret passage that led from a
statue of a one-eyed witch in Hogwarts, to the cellar of the
Honeydukes candyshop in Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>"How's it doing?" said Fred in a low voice.</p>
<p>(Not that there'd be anyone listening, but there was something
odd about talking in a normal voice when you were going through a
secret passage.)</p>
<p>"Still on the fritz," said George.</p>
<p>"Both, or -"</p>
<p>"Intermittent one fixed itself again. Other one's same as
ever."</p>
<p>The Map was an extraordinarily powerful artifact, capable of
tracking every sentient being on the school grounds, in real time,
by name. Almost certainly, it had been created during the original
raising of Hogwarts. It was <i>not good</i> that errors were
starting to pop up. Chances were that no one except Dumbledore
could fix it if it was broken.</p>
<p>And the Weasley twins weren't about to turn the Map over to
Dumbledore. It would have been an unforgivable insult to the
Marauders - the four unknowns who'd managed to steal part of the
<i>Hogwarts security system</i>, something probably forged by
Salazar Slytherin himself, and twist it into <i>a tool for student
pranking</i>.</p>
<p>Some might have considered it disrespectful.</p>
<p>Some might have considered it criminal.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins firmly believed that if Godric Gryffindor had
been around to see it, he would have approved.</p>
<p>The brothers walked on and on and on, mostly in silence. The
Weasley twins talked to each other when they were thinking through
new pranks, or when one of them knew something the other didn't.
Otherwise there wasn't much point. If they already knew the same
information, they tended to think the same thoughts and make the
same decisions.</p>
<p>(Back in the old days, whenever magical identical twins were
born, it had been the custom to kill one of them after birth.)</p>
<p>In time, Fred and George clambered out into a dusty cellar,
strewn with barrels and racks of strange ingredients.</p>
<p>Fred and George waited. It wouldn't have been polite to do
anything else.</p>
<p>Before too long a thin old man in black pajamas clambered down
the steps that led into the cellar, yawning. "Hello, boys," said
Ambrosius Flume. "I wasn't expecting you tonight. Out of stock
already?"</p>
<p>Fred and George decided that Fred would speak.</p>
<p>"Not exactly, Mr. Flume," said Fred. "We were hoping you could
help us with something considerably more... interesting."</p>
<p>"Now, boys," said Flume, sounding severe, "I hope you didn't
wake me up just so I could tell you again that I'm not selling you
any merchandise that could get you into real trouble. Not until
you're sixteen, anyways -"</p>
<p>George drew forth an item from his robes, and wordlessly passed
it to Flume. "Have you seen this?" said Fred.</p>
<p>Flume looked at yesterday's edition of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>
and nodded, scowling. The headline on the paper read THE NEXT DARK
LORD? and showed a young boy which some student's camera had
managed to catch in an uncharacteristically cold and grim
expression.</p>
<p>"I can't believe that Malfoy," Flume snapped. "Going after the
boy when he's only eleven! The man ought to be ground up and used
to make chocolates!"</p>
<p>Fred and George blinked in unison. <i>Malfoy</i> was behind Rita
Skeeter? Harry Potter hadn't warned them about that... which surely
meant that Harry didn't know. He never would have brought them in
if he did...</p>
<p>Fred and George exchanged glances. Well, Harry didn't
<i>need</i> to know until after the job was done.</p>
<p>"Mr. Flume," Fred said quietly, "the Boy-Who-Lived needs your
help."</p>
<p>Flume looked at them both.</p>
<p>Then he let out his breath with a sigh.</p>
<p>"All right," said Flume, "what do you want?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Act 6:</i></p>
<p>When Rita Skeeter was intent on a tasty prey, she didn't tend to
notice the scurrying ants who constituted the rest of the universe,
which was how she almost bumped into the balding young man who'd
stepped into her pathway.</p>
<p>"Miss Skeeter," said the man, sounding rather severe and cold
for someone whose face looked that young. "Fancy running into you
here."</p>
<p>"Out of my way, buster!" snapped Rita, and tried to step around
him.</p>
<p>The man in her pathway matched the movement so perfectly that it
was like neither of them had moved at all, just stood still while
the street shifted around them.</p>
<p>Rita's eyes narrowed. "Who do you think you are?"</p>
<p>"How very foolish," the man said dryly. "It would have been wise
to memorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry
Potter to be the next Dark Lord. After all," a thin smile,
"<i>that</i> certainly sounds like someone you wouldn't want to run
into on the street, especially after doing a hatchet job on him in
the newspaper."</p>
<p>Rita took a moment to place the reference. <i>This</i> was
Quirinus Quirrell? He looked too young and too old at the same
time; his face, if it relaxed from its severe and condescending
pose, would belong to someone in his late thirties. And his hair
was already falling out? Couldn't he afford a healer?</p>
<p>No, that wasn't important, she had a time and a place and a
beetle to be. She'd just received an anonymous tip about Madam
Bones making time with one of her younger assistants. That would be
worth quite a bonus if she could manage to verify it, Bones was
high on the hit list. The tipster had said that Bones and her young
assistant were due to eat lunch in a special room at Mary's Place,
a very popular room for certain purposes; a room which, she'd
found, was secure against all listening devices, but not proof
against a beautiful blue beetle nestled up against one wall...</p>
<p>"Out of my <i>way!</i>" Rita said, and tried to push Quirrell
from her path. Quirrell's arm brushed her own, deflecting, and Rita
staggered as the thrust went into the thin air.</p>
<p>Quirrell pulled up the sleeve of his left robe, showing his left
arm. "Observe," said Quirrell, "no Dark Mark. I would like your
paper to publish a retraction."</p>
<p>Rita let out an incredulous laugh. Of course the man wasn't a
real Death Eater. The paper wouldn't have published it if he was.
"Forget it, buster. Now take a hike."</p>
<p>Quirrell stared at her for a moment.</p>
<p>Then he smiled.</p>
<p>"Miss Skeeter," said Quirrell, "I had hoped to find some lever
that would prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself
the pleasure of simply crushing you."</p>
<p>"It's been tried. Now get out of my way, buster, or I'll find
some Aurors and have you arrested for obstruction of
journalism."</p>
<p>Quirrell swept her a small bow, and then walked past. "Goodbye,
Rita Skeeter," said his voice from behind her.</p>
<p>As Rita bulled on ahead, she noted in the back of her mind that
the man was whistling a tune as he walked away.</p>
<p>Like <i>that</i> would scare her.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Act 4:</i></p>
<p>"Sorry, count me out," said Lee Jordan. "I'm more the giant
spider type."</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived had said that he had <i>important</i> work for
the Order of Chaos, something serious and secret, more significant
and difficult than their usual run of pranks.</p>
<p>And then Harry Potter had launched into a speech that was
inspiring, yet vague. A speech to the effect that Fred and George
and Lee had tremendous potential if they could just learn to be
<i>weirder.</i> To make people's lives <i>surreal,</i> instead of
just surprising them with the equivalents of buckets of water
propped above doors. (Fred and George had exchanged interested
looks, they'd never thought of that one.) Harry Potter had invoked
a picture of the prank they'd pulled on Neville - which, Harry had
mentioned with some remorse, the Sorting Hat had chewed him out on
- but which must have made Neville <i>doubt his own sanity.</i> For
Neville it would have felt like being suddenly transported into an
alternate universe. The same way everyone else had felt when they'd
seen Snape apologize. That was the <i>true power of
pranking.</i></p>
<p><i>Are you with me?</i> Harry Potter had cried, and Lee Jordan
had answered no.</p>
<p>"Count us <i>in</i>," said Fred, or possibly George, for there
was no doubt that Godric Gryffindor would have said yes.</p>
<p>Lee Jordan gave a regretful grin, and stood up, and left the
deserted and Quieted corridor where the four members of the Order
of Chaos had met and sat down in a conspiratorial circle.</p>
<p>The three members of the Order of Chaos got down to
business.</p>
<p>(It wasn't <i>that</i> sad. Fred and George would still work
with Lee on giant spider pranks, same as ever. They'd only started
calling it the Order of Chaos in order to recruit Harry Potter,
after Ron had told them about Harry being weird and evil, and Fred
and George had decided to save Harry by showing him true friendship
and kindness. Thankfully this no longer seemed necessary - although
they weren't <i>quite</i> sure about that...)</p>
<p>"So," said one of the twins, "what's this about?"</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter," said Harry. "Do you know who she is?"</p>
<p>Fred and George nodded, frowning.</p>
<p>"She's been asking questions about me."</p>
<p>That wasn't good news.</p>
<p>"Can you guess what I want you to do?"</p>
<p>Fred and George looked at each other, a bit puzzled. "You want
us to slip her some of our more interesting candies?"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry. "No, no, <i>no!</i> That's giant-spider
thinking! Come on, what would <i>you</i> do if you heard that Rita
Skeeter was looking for rumors about <i>you?</i>"</p>
<p>That made it obvious.</p>
<p>Grins slowly started on the faces of Fred and George.</p>
<p>"Start rumors about ourselves," they replied.</p>
<p>"<i>Exactly,</i>" said Harry, grinning widely. "But these can't
be just <i>any</i> rumors. I want to teach people never to believe
what the newspaper says about Harry Potter, any more than Muggles
believe what the newspaper says about Elvis. At first I just
thought about flooding Rita Skeeter with so many rumors that she
wouldn't know what to believe, but then she'll just cherry-pick the
ones that sound plausible and bad. So what I want you to do is
create a fake story about me, and get Rita Skeeter to believe it
somehow. But it has to be something that, afterward, everyone will
<i>know</i> was fake. We want to fool Rita Skeeter and her editors,
and <i>afterward</i> have the proof come out that it was false. And
of course - given that those are the requirements - the story has
to be as <i>ridiculous</i> as it can possibly be, and still get
printed. Do you understand what I want you to do?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly..." Fred or George said slowly. "You want us to
<i>invent</i> the story?"</p>
<p>"I want you to do <i>all</i> of it," Harry Potter said. "I'm
sort of busy right now, plus I want to be able to say truthfully
that I had no idea what was coming. Surprise me."</p>
<p>For a moment there was a very evil grin on the faces of Fred and
George.</p>
<p>Then they turned serious. "But Harry, we don't really know how
to do anything like that -"</p>
<p>"So figure it out," Harry said. "I have confidence in you. Not
<i>total</i> confidence, but if you <i>can't</i> do it, <i>tell</i>
me that, and I'll try someone else, or do it myself. If you have a
really good idea - for both the ridiculous story, and how to
convince Rita Skeeter and her editors to print it - then you can go
ahead and do it. But don't go with something mediocre. If you can't
come up with something <i>awesome</i>, just say so."</p>
<p>Fred and George exchanged worried glances.</p>
<p>"I can't think of anything," said George.</p>
<p>"Neither can I," said Fred. "Sorry."</p>
<p>Harry stared at them.</p>
<p>And then Harry began to explain how you went about thinking of
things.</p>
<p>It had been known to take longer than two seconds, said
Harry.</p>
<p>You <i>never</i> called <i>any</i> question impossible, said
Harry, until you had taken an actual clock and thought about it for
five minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not five minutes
metaphorically, five minutes by a physical clock.</p>
<p>And <i>furthermore,</i> Harry said, his voice emphatic and his
right hand thumping hard on the floor, you did <i>not</i> start out
immediately looking for solutions.</p>
<p>Harry then launched into an explanation of a test done by
someone named Norman Maier, who was something called an
organizational psychologist, and who'd asked two different sets of
problem-solving groups to tackle a problem.</p>
<p>The problem, Harry said, had involved three employees doing
three jobs. The junior employee wanted to just do the easiest job.
The senior employee wanted to rotate between jobs, to avoid
boredom. An efficiency expert had recommended giving the junior
person the easiest job and the senior person the hardest job, which
would be 20% more productive.</p>
<p><i>One</i> set of problem-solving groups had been given the
instruction "Do not propose solutions until the problem has been
discussed as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any."</p>
<p>The other set of problem-solving groups had been given no
instructions. And those people had done the natural thing, and
reacted to the presence of a problem by proposing solutions. And
people had gotten attached to those solutions, and started fighting
about them, and arguing about the relative importance of freedom
versus efficiency and so on.</p>
<p>The first set of problem-solving groups, the ones given
instructions to <i>discuss</i> the problem first and <i>then</i>
solve it, had been far more likely to hit upon the solution of
letting the junior employee keep the easiest job and rotating the
other two people between the other two jobs, for what the expert's
data said would be a 19% improvement.</p>
<p>Starting out by looking for solutions was taking things
<i>entirely out of order.</i> Like starting a meal with dessert,
only <i>bad.</i></p>
<p>(Harry also quoted someone named Robyn Dawes as saying that the
harder a problem was, the more likely people were to try to solve
it immediately.)</p>
<p>So Harry was going to leave this problem to Fred and George, and
they would discuss all the aspects of it and brainstorm anything
they thought might be remotely relevant. And they shouldn't try to
come up with an actual solution until they'd finished doing that,
unless of course they <i>did</i> happen to randomly think of
something awesome, in which case they could write it down for
afterward and then go back to thinking. And he didn't want to hear
back from them about any so-called <i>failures to think of
anything</i> for at least a week. Some people spent <i>decades</i>
trying to think of things.</p>
<p>"Any questions?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Fred and George stared at each other.</p>
<p>"I can't think of any."</p>
<p>"Neither can I."</p>
<p>Harry coughed gently. "You didn't ask about your budget."</p>
<p><i>Budget?</i> they thought.</p>
<p>"I could just tell you the amount," Harry said. "But I think
<i>this</i> will be more <i>inspiring</i>."</p>
<p>Harry's hands dipped into his robe, and brought forth -</p>
<p>Fred and George almost fell over, even though they were sitting
down.</p>
<p>"Don't spend it for the sake of spending it," Harry said. On the
stone floor in front of them gleamed an absolutely ridiculous
amount of money. "Only spend it if awesomeness requires; and what
awesomeness does require, don't hesitate to spend. If there's
anything left over, just return it afterward, I trust you. Oh, and
you get ten percent of what's there, regardless of how much you end
up spending -"</p>
<p>"We <i>can't!</i>" blurted one of the twins. "We don't accept
money for that sort of thing!"</p>
<p>(The twins never took money for doing anything illegal. Unknown
to Ambrosius Flume, they were selling all of his merchandise at
zero percent markup. Fred and George wanted to be able to testify -
under Veritaserum if necessary - that they had not been
profiteering criminals, just providing a public service.)</p>
<p>Harry frowned at them. "But I'm asking you to put in some real
work here. A grownup would get paid for doing something like this,
and it would <i>still</i> count as a favor for a friend. You can't
just hire people for this sort of thing."</p>
<p>Fred and George shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Fine," Harry said. "I'll just get you expensive Christmas
presents, and if you try returning them to me I'll burn them. Now
you don't even <i>know</i> how much I'm going to spend on you,
except, obviously, that it's going to be more than if you'd just
taken the money. And I'm going to buy you those presents
<i>anyway,</i> so think about <i>that</i> before you tell me <i>you
can't think of anything awesome</i>."</p>
<p>Harry stood up, smiling, and turned to go while Fred and George
were still gaping in shock. He strode a few steps away, and then
turned back.</p>
<p>"Oh, one last thing," Harry said. "Leave Professor Quirrell out
of whatever you do. He doesn't like publicity. I know it'd be
easier to get people to believe weird things about the Defense
Professor than anyone else, and I'm sorry to have to get in your
way like that, but please, leave Professor Quirrell out of it."</p>
<p>And Harry turned again and took a few more steps -</p>
<p>Looked back one last time, and said, softly, "Thank you."</p>
<p>And left.</p>
<p>There was a long pause after he'd departed.</p>
<p>"So," said one.</p>
<p>"So," said the other.</p>
<p>"The Defense Professor doesn't like publicity, does he."</p>
<p>"Harry doesn't know us very well, does he."</p>
<p>"No, he doesn't."</p>
<p>"But we won't use his money for that, of course."</p>
<p>"Of course not, that wouldn't be right. We'll do the Defense
Professor separately."</p>
<p>"We'll get some Gryffindors to write Skeeter, and say..."</p>
<p>"...his sleeve lifted up one time in Defense class, and they saw
the Dark Mark..."</p>
<p>"...and he's probably teaching Harry Potter all sorts of
dreadful things..."</p>
<p>"...and he's the worst Defense Professor anyone remembers even
in Hogwarts, he's not just <i>failing</i> to teach us, he's getting
everything wrong, the complete opposite of what it should
be..."</p>
<p>"...like when he claimed that you could only cast the Killing
Curse using love, which made it pretty much useless."</p>
<p>"I like that one."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"I bet the Defense Professor likes it too."</p>
<p>"He does have a sense of humor. He wouldn't have called us what
he did if he didn't have a sense of humor."</p>
<p>"But are we really going to be able to do Harry's job?"</p>
<p>"Harry said to discuss the problem before trying to solve it, so
let's do that."</p>
<p>The Weasley twins decided that George would be the enthusiastic
one while Fred doubted.</p>
<p>"It all seems sort of contradictory," said Fred. "He wants it to
be ridiculous enough that everyone laughs at Skeeter and knows it's
wrong, and he wants Skeeter to believe it. We can't do both things
at the same time."</p>
<p>"We'll have to fake up some evidence to convince Skeeter," said
George.</p>
<p>"Was that a solution?" said Fred.</p>
<p>They considered this.</p>
<p>"Maybe," said George, "but I don't think we should be all
<i>that</i> strict about it, do you?"</p>
<p>The twins shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>"So then the fake evidence has to be good enough to convince
Skeeter," said Fred. "Can we really do that on our own?"</p>
<p>"We don't have to do it on our own," said George, and pointed to
the pile of money. "We can hire other people to help us."</p>
<p>The twins got a thoughtful look on their face.</p>
<p>"That could use up Harry's budget pretty fast," said Fred. "This
is a lot of money for us, but it's not a lot of money for someone
like Flume."</p>
<p>"Maybe people will give discounts if they know it's for Harry,"
said George. "But most importantly of all, whatever we do, it has
to be <i>impossible</i>."</p>
<p>Fred blinked. "What do you mean, <i>impossible?</i>"</p>
<p>"So impossible that we don't get in trouble, because no one
believes we could have done it. So impossible that even Harry
starts wondering. It has to be surreal, it has to make people doubt
their own sanity, it has to be... <i>better than Harry.</i>"</p>
<p>Fred's eyes were wide in astonishment. This happened sometimes,
between them, but not often. "But why?"</p>
<p>"They were pranks. They were <i>all</i> pranks. The pie was a
prank. The Remembrall was a prank. Kevin Entwhistle's cat was a
prank. <i>Snape</i> was a prank. <i>We're</i> the best pranksters
in Hogwarts, are we going to roll over and give up without a
fight?"</p>
<p>"He's the Boy-Who-Lived," said Fred.</p>
<p>"And <i>we're</i> the Weasley twins! He's <i>challenging</i> us.
He said we could do what he does. But I bet he doesn't think we'll
ever be as good as <i>him.</i>"</p>
<p>"He's right," said Fred, feeling rather nervous. The Weasley
twins did <i>sometimes</i> disagree even when they had all the same
information, but every time they did it seemed unnatural, like at
least one of them must be doing something wrong. "This is <i>Harry
Potter</i> we're talking about. He can do the impossible. We
can't."</p>
<p>"Yes we can," said George. "And we have to be <i>more</i>
impossible than him."</p>
<p>"But -" said Fred.</p>
<p>"It's what Godric Gryffindor would do," said George.</p>
<p>That settled it, and the twins snapped back into... whatever it
was that was normal for them.</p>
<p>"All right, then -"</p>
<p>"- let's think about it."</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Professor Quirrell's office hours consisted of 11:40 to 11:55 AM
on Thursday. That was for all of his students in all years. It cost
a Quirrell point just to knock on the door, and if he didn't think
your reason was worth his time, you would lose another fifty.</p>
<p>Harry knocked on the door.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then a biting voice said, "I suppose you may
as well come in, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>And before Harry could touch the doorknob, the door slammed
open, hitting the wall with a sharp crack that sounded like
something might have broken in the wood, or the stone, or both.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair and reading a
suspiciously old-looking book, bound in night-blue leather with
silver runes on the spine. His eyes had not moved from the pages.
"I am not in a good mood, Mr. Potter. And when I am not a good
mood, I am not a pleasant person to be around. For your own sake,
conduct your business quickly and depart."</p>
<p>A cold chill seeped from the room, as though it contained
something that cast darkness the way lamps cast light, and which
hadn't been fully shaded.</p>
<p>Harry was a bit taken aback. <i>Not in a good mood</i> didn't
quite seem to cover it. What could be bothering Professor Quirrell
this much...?</p>
<p>Well, you didn't just walk out on friends when they were feeling
down. Harry cautiously advanced into the room. "Is there anything I
can do to help -"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, still not looking up from the
book.</p>
<p>"I mean, if you've been dealing with idiots and want someone
sane to talk to..."</p>
<p>There was a surprisingly long pause.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell slammed the book shut and it vanished with a
small whispering sound. He looked up, then, and Harry flinched.</p>
<p>"I suppose an intelligent conversation would be pleasant for
<i>me</i> at this point," said Professor Quirrell in the same
biting tone that had invited Harry to enter. "<i>You</i> are not
likely to find it so, be warned."</p>
<p>Harry drew a deep breath. "I promise I won't mind if you snap at
me. What happened?"</p>
<p>The cold in the room seemed to deepen. "A sixth-year Gryffindor
cast a curse at one of my more promising students, a sixth-year
Slytherin."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "What... sort of curse?"</p>
<p>And the fury on Professor Quirrell's face was no longer
contained. "Why bother to ask an unimportant question like that,
Mr. Potter? Our friend the sixth-year Gryffindor did not think it
was important!"</p>
<p>"Are you <i>serious?</i>" Harry said before he could stop
himself.</p>
<p>"No, I'm in a terrible mood today for no particular reason.
<i>Yes I'm serious, you fool!</i> He didn't know. He <i>actually
didn't know.</i> I didn't believe it until the Aurors confirmed it
under Veritaserum. He is in his <i>sixth year at Hogwarts</i> and
he cast a high-level Dark curse <i>without knowing what it
did.</i>"</p>
<p>"You don't mean," Harry said, "that he was <i>mistaken</i> about
what it did, that he somehow read the wrong spell description
-"</p>
<p>"All he knew was that it was meant to be directed at an enemy.
He <i>knew</i> that was all he knew."</p>
<p>And that had been enough to cast the spell. "I do not understand
how anything with that small a brain could walk upright."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Professor Quirrell leaned forward and picked
up the silver inkwell from his desk, turning it around in his
hands, staring at it as though wondering how he could go about
torturing an inkwell to death.</p>
<p>"Was the sixth-year Slytherin seriously hurt?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Was the sixth-year Gryffindor raised by Muggles?"</p>
<p>"<i>Yes.</i>"</p>
<p>"Is Dumbledore refusing to expel him because the poor boy didn't
know?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's hands whitened on the inkwell. "<i>Do you
have a point, Mr. Potter, or are you just stating the
obvious?</i>"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Harry gravely, "all the Muggle-raised
students in Hogwarts need a safety lecture in which they are told
the things so ridiculously obvious that no wizardborn would ever
think to mention them. Don't cast curses if you don't know what
they do, if you discover something dangerous don't tell the world
about it, don't brew high-level potions without supervision in a
bathroom, the reason why there are underage magic laws, all the
basics."</p>
<p>"Why?" said Professor Quirrell. "Let the stupid ones die before
they breed."</p>
<p>"If you don't mind losing a few sixth-year Slytherins along with
them."</p>
<p>The inkwell caught fire in Professor Quirrell's hands and burned
with a terrible slowness, hideous black-orange flames tearing at
the metal and seeming to take tiny bites from it, the silver
twisting as it melted, as though it were trying and failing to
escape. There was a tinny shrieking sound, as though the metal were
screaming.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are right," Professor Quirrell said with a
resigned smile. "I shall design a lecture to ensure that
Muggleborns who are too stupid to live do not take anyone valuable
with them as they depart."</p>
<p>The inkwell went on screaming and burning in Professor
Quirrell's hands, tiny droplets of metal, still on fire, now
dripping to the desk, as though the inkwell were crying.</p>
<p>"You're not running away," observed Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth -</p>
<p>"If you're about to say you're not scared of me," said Professor
Quirrell, "<i>don't.</i>"</p>
<p>"You are the scariest person I know," Harry said, "and one of
the top reasons for that is your control. I simply can't imagine
hearing that you'd hurt someone you had not made a deliberate
decision to hurt."</p>
<p>The fire in Professor Quirrell's hands winked out, and he
carefully placed the ruined inkwell on his desk. "You say the
nicest things, Mr. Potter. Have you been taking lessons in
flattery? From, perhaps, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Harry kept his expression blank, and realized one second too
late that it might as well have been a signed confession. Professor
Quirrell didn't care what your expression looked like, he cared
which states of mind made it likely.</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "Mr. Malfoy is a useful friend
to have, Mr. Potter, and there is much he can teach you, but I hope
you have not made the mistake of trusting him with too many
confidences."</p>
<p>"He knows nothing which I fear becoming known," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Well done," said Professor Quirrell, smiling slightly. "So what
was your original business here?"</p>
<p>"I think I'm done with the preliminary exercises in Occlumency
and ready for the tutor."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "I shall conduct you to Gringotts
this Sunday." He paused, looking at Harry, and smiled. "And we
might even make it a little outing, if you like. I've just had a
pleasant thought."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, smiling back.</p>
<p>As Harry left the office, he heard Professor Quirrell humming a
small tune.</p>
<p>Harry was glad he'd been able to cheer him up.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>That Sunday there seemed to be a rather large number of people
whispering in the hallways, at least when Harry Potter walked past
them.</p>
<p>And a lot of pointed fingers.</p>
<p>And a great deal of female giggling.</p>
<p>It had started at breakfast, when someone had asked Harry if
he'd heard the news, and Harry had quickly interrupted and said
that if the news was written by Rita Skeeter then he didn't want to
<i>hear</i> about it, he wanted to read it in the paper
himself.</p>
<p>It had then developed that not many students at Hogwarts got
copies of the <i>Daily Prophet,</i> and that the copies which had
not already been bought up from their owners were being passed
around in some sort of complicated order and nobody really knew who
had one at the moment...</p>
<p>So Harry had used a Quieting Charm and gone on to eat his
breakfast, trusting to his seat-mates to wave off the many, many
questioners, and doing his best to ignore the incredulity, the
laughter, the congratulatory smiles, the pitying looks, the fearful
glances, and the dropped plates as new people came down for
breakfast and heard.</p>
<p>Harry was feeling <i>rather</i> curious, but it <i>really</i>
wouldn't have done to spoil the artistry by hearing it
secondhand.</p>
<p>He'd done homework in the safety of his trunk for the next
couple of hours, after telling his dormmates to come get him if
anyone found him an original newspaper.</p>
<p>Harry was still ignorant at 10AM, when he'd left Hogwarts in a
carriage with Professor Quirrell, who was in the front right, and
currently slumped over in zombie-mode. Harry was sitting diagonally
across, as far away as the carriage allowed, in the back left. Even
so, Harry had a constant feeling of doom as the carriage rattled
over a small path through a section of non-forbidden forest. It
made it a bit hard to read, especially since the material was
difficult, and Harry suddenly wished he was reading one of his
childhood science fiction books instead -</p>
<p>"We're outside the wards, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell's
voice from the front. "Time to go."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell carefully disembarked from the carriage,
bracing himself as he stepped down. Harry, on his own side, jumped
off.</p>
<p>Harry was wondering exactly how they'd get there when Professor
Quirrell said "Catch!" and threw a bronze Knut at him, and Harry
caught it without thinking.</p>
<p>A giant intangible hook caught at Harry's abdomen and yanked him
back, hard, only without any sense of acceleration, and an instant
later Harry was standing in the middle of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>(<i>Excuse me, what?</i> said his brain.)</p>
<p>(<i>We just teleported,</i> explained Harry.)</p>
<p>(<i>That didn't used to happen in the ancestral environment,</i>
Harry's brain complained, and disoriented him.)</p>
<p>Harry staggered as his feet adjusted to the brick of the street
instead of the dirt of the forest corridor they had been
traversing. He straightened, still dizzy, with the bustling witches
and wizards seeming to sway slightly, and the cries of the
shopkeepers seeming to move around in his hearing, as his brain
tried to place a world to be located in.</p>
<p>Moments later, there was a sort of sucking-popping sound from a
few paces behind Harry, and when Harry turned to look Professor
Quirrell was there.</p>
<p>"Do you mind -" said Harry, at the same time as Professor
Quirrell said, "I'm afraid I -"</p>
<p>Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn't.</p>
<p>"- need to go off and set something in motion, Mr. Potter. As it
has been thoroughly explained to me that I am responsible for
anything whatsoever that happens to you, I'll be leaving you with
-"</p>
<p>"Newsstand," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>"Or anywhere I can buy a copy of the <i>Daily Prophet.</i> Put
me there and I'll be happy."</p>
<p>Shortly after, Harry had been delivered into a bookstore,
accompanied by several quietly spoken, ambiguous threats. And the
shopkeeper had gotten <i>less</i> ambiguous threats, judging by the
way he had cringed, and how his eyes now kept darting between Harry
and the entrance.</p>
<p>If the bookstore burned down, Harry was going to stick around in
the middle of the fire until Professor Quirrell got back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile -</p>
<p>Harry took a quick glance around.</p>
<p>The bookstore seemed rather small and shoddy, with only four
rows of bookcases visible, and the nearest shelf Harry's eyes had
jumped to seemed to deal with narrow, cheaply bound books with grim
titles like <i>The Massacre of Albania in the Fifteenth
Century.</i></p>
<p>First things first. Harry stepped over to the seller's
counter.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," said Harry, "One copy of the <i>Daily Prophet,</i>
please."</p>
<p>"Five Sickles," said the shopkeeper. "Sorry, kid, I've only got
three left."</p>
<p>Five Sickles dropped onto the counter. Harry had the feeling he
could have bargained him down a couple of points, but at this point
he didn't really care.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper's eyes widened and he seemed to really notice
Harry for the first time. "<i>You!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Me!</i>"</p>
<p>"Is it <i>true?</i> Are you <i>really</i> -"</p>
<p>"<i>Shut up!</i> Sorry, I've been waiting <i>all day</i> to read
this in the original newspaper instead of hearing about it
secondhand, so please just <i>hand it over</i>, all right?"</p>
<p>The shopkeeper stared at Harry for a moment, then wordlessly
reached under the counter and passed over one folded copy of the
<i>Daily Prophet</i>.</p>
<p>The headline read:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>HARRY POTTER<br />
SECRETLY BETROTHED<br />
TO GINEVRA WEASLEY</i></p>
<p>Harry stared.</p>
<p>He lifted the newspaper off the counter, softly, reverently,
like he was handling an original Escher artwork, and unbent it to
read...</p>
<p>...about the evidence that had convinced Rita Skeeter.</p>
<p>...and some interesting further details.</p>
<p>...and yet more evidence.</p>
<p>Fred and George had cleared it with their sister first, surely?
Yes, of course they had. There was a picture of Ginevra Weasley
sighing longingly over what Harry could see, looking closely, was a
photo of himself. That had to have been staged.</p>
<p>But <i>how</i> on <i>Earth...?</i></p>
<p>Harry was sitting in a cheap folding chair, rereading the
newspaper for the fourth time, when the door whispered softly and
Professor Quirrell came back into the shop.</p>
<p>"My apologies for - <i>what</i> in Merlin's name are you
reading?"</p>
<p>"It would seem," said Harry, awe in his voice, "that one Mr.
Arthur Weasley was placed under the Imperius Curse by a Death Eater
whom my father killed, thus creating a debt to House Potter, which
my father demanded be repaid by the hand in marriage of the
recently born Ginevra Weasley. Do people actually do that sort of
thing around here?"</p>
<p>"How could Miss Skeeter <i>possibly</i> be fool enough to
believe -"</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell's voice cut off.</p>
<p>Harry had been reading the newspaper held vertically and
unfolded, which meant that Professor Quirrell, from where he was
standing, could see the text underneath the headline.</p>
<p>The look of shock on Professor Quirrell's face was a work of art
almost on par with the newspaper itself.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Harry cheerfully, "it's all fake."</p>
<p>From elsewhere in the store, he heard the shopkeeper gasp. There
was the sound of a stack of books falling over.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter..." Professor Quirrell said slowly, "are you
<i>sure</i> of that?"</p>
<p>"Quite sure. Shall we go?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded, looking rather abstracted, and Harry
folded the newspaper back up, and followed him out of the door.</p>
<p>For some reason Harry didn't seem to be hearing any street
noises now.</p>
<p>They walked in silence for thirty seconds before Professor
Quirrell spoke. "Miss Skeeter viewed the original proceedings of
the restricted Wizengamot session."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The <i>original proceedings of the Wizengamot.</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> would have trouble doing that."</p>
<p>"Really?" said Harry. "Because if my suspicions are correct,
this was done by a Hogwarts student."</p>
<p>"That is beyond impossible," Professor Quirrell said flatly.
"Mr. Potter... I regret to say that this young lady expects to
marry you."</p>
<p>"But <i>that</i> is improbable," said Harry. "To quote Douglas
Adams, the impossible often has a kind of integrity which the
merely improbable lacks."</p>
<p>"I see your point," Professor Quirrell said slowly. "But... no,
Mr. Potter. It may be impossible, but I can <i>imagine</i>
tampering with the Wizengamot proceedings. It is
<i>unimaginable</i> that the Grand Manager of Gringotts should
affix the seal of his office in witness to a false betrothal
contract, and Miss Skeeter personally verified that seal."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Harry, "you would expect the Grand Manager of
Gringotts to get involved with that much money changing hands. It
seems Mr. Weasley was greatly in debt, and so demanded an
additional payment of ten thousand Galleons -"</p>
<p>"<i>Ten thousand</i> Galleons for a <i>Weasley?</i> You could
buy the daughter of a Noble House for that!"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said. "I really have to ask at this point, do
people actually do that sort of thing around here -"</p>
<p>"Rarely," said Professor Quirrell, with a frown on his face.
"And not at all, I suspect, since the Dark Lord departed. I suppose
that according to the newspaper, your father just paid it?"</p>
<p>"He didn't have any choice," said Harry. "Not if he wanted to
fulfill the conditions of the prophecy."</p>
<p>"<i>Give me that,</i>" said Professor Quirrell, and the
newspaper leaped out of Harry's hand so fast that he got a paper
cut.</p>
<p>Harry automatically put the finger in his mouth to suck on,
feeling rather shocked, and turned to remonstrate with Professor
Quirrell -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had stopped short in the middle of the
street, and his eyes were flickering rapidly back and forth as an
invisible force held the newspaper suspended before him.</p>
<p>Harry watched, gaping in open awe, as the newspaper opened to
reveal pages two and three. And not much long after, four and five.
It was like the man had cast off a pretense of mortality.</p>
<p>And after a troublingly short time, the paper neatly folded
itself up again. Professor Quirrell plucked it from the air and
tossed it to Harry, who caught it in sheer reflex; and then
Professor Quirrell started walking again, and Harry automatically
trudged after.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, "that prophecy didn't sound quite
right to me either."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, still stunned.</p>
<p>"The centaurs could have been put under an <i>Imperius</i>,"
Professor Quirrell said, frowning, "<i>that</i> seems
understandable. What magic can make, magic can corrupt, and it is
not unthinkable that the Great Seal of Gringotts could be twisted
to another's hand. The Unspeakable could have been impersonated
with Polyjuice, likewise the Bavarian seer. And with <i>enough</i>
effort it might be possible to tamper with the proceedings of the
Wizengamot. Do you have any idea how that was done?"</p>
<p>"I do not have one single plausible hypothesis," said Harry. "I
do know it was done on a total budget of forty Galleons."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell stopped short and whirled on Harry. His
expression was now completely incredulous. "Forty Galleons will pay
a competent ward-breaker to open a path into a home you wish to
burglarize! Forty <i>thousand</i> Galleons <i>might</i> pay a team
of the greatest professional criminals in the world to tamper with
the proceedings of the Wizengamot!"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. "I'll remember that the next time I
want to save thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty Galleons
by finding the right contractor."</p>
<p>"I do not say this often," said Professor Quirrell. "I am
impressed."</p>
<p>"Likewise," said Harry.</p>
<p>"And who is this incredible Hogwarts student?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't say."</p>
<p>Somewhat to Harry's surprise, Professor Quirrell made no
objection to this.</p>
<p>They walked in the direction of the Gringotts building,
thinking, for they were neither of them the sort of person who
would give up on the problem without considering it for at least
five minutes.</p>
<p>"I have a feeling," Harry said finally, "that we're coming at
this from the wrong angle. There's a tale I once heard about some
students who came into a physics class, and the teacher showed them
a large metal plate near a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal
plate, and they felt that the metal nearer the fire was cooler, and
the metal further away was warmer. And she said, write down your
guess for why this happens. So some students wrote down 'because of
how the metal conducts heat', and some students wrote down 'because
of how the air moves', and no one said 'this just seems
impossible', and the real answer was that before the students came
into the room, the teacher turned the plate around."</p>
<p>"Interesting," said Professor Quirrell. "That does sound
similar. Is there a moral?"</p>
<p>"That your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more
confused by fiction than by reality," said Harry. "If you're
equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge.
The students thought they could use words like 'because of heat
conduction' to explain anything, even a metal plate being cooler on
the side nearer the fire. So they didn't notice how confused they
were, and that meant they couldn't be more confused by falsehood
than by truth. If you tell me that the centaurs were under the
<i>Imperius</i> Curse, I still have the feeling of something being
not quite right. I notice that I'm still confused even after
hearing your explanation."</p>
<p>"Hm," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>They walked on further.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose," said Harry, "that it's possible to
<i>actually</i> swap people into alternate universes? Like, this
isn't our own Rita Skeeter, or they temporarily sent her somewhere
else?"</p>
<p>"If <i>that</i> was possible," Professor Quirrell said, his
voice rather dry, "would I still be <i>here?</i>"</p>
<p>And just as they were almost to the huge white front of the
Gringotts building, Professor Quirrell said:</p>
<p>"Ah. Of <i>course.</i> I see it now. Let me guess, the Weasley
twins?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Harry, his voice going up another octave in
pitch. "<i>How?</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I couldn't say."</p>
<p>"...That is <i>not</i> fair."</p>
<p>"I think it is extremely fair," said Professor Quirrell, and
they entered through the bronze doors.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The time was just before noon, and Harry and Professor Quirrell
were seated at the foot and head of a wide, long, flat table, in a
sumptuously appointed private room with thoroughly cushioned
couches and chairs along the walls, and soft curtains hanging
everywhere.</p>
<p>They were about to eat lunch in Mary's Place, which Professor
Quirrell had said was known to him as one of the best restaurants
in Diagon Alley, especially for - his voice had dropped
meaningfully - <i>certain purposes.</i></p>
<p>It was the nicest restaurant that Harry had ever been in, and it
was really eating away at Harry that Professor Quirrell was
treating <i>him</i> to the meal.</p>
<p>The first part of the mission, to find an Occlumency instructor,
had been a success. Professor Quirrell, smiling evilly, had told
Griphook to recommend the best he knew, and not worry about the
expense, since Dumbledore was paying it; and the goblin had smiled
in return. There might have been a certain amount of smiling on
Harry's part as well.</p>
<p>The second part of the plan had been a complete failure.</p>
<p>Harry was not allowed to take money out of his vault without
Headmaster Dumbledore or some other school official present, and
Professor Quirrell had not been given the vault key. Harry's Muggle
parents could not authorize it because they were Muggles, and
Muggles had around the same legal standing as children or kittens:
they were cute, so if you tortured them in public you could get
arrested, but they weren't <i>people</i>. Some reluctant provision
had been made for recognizing the parents of Muggleborns as human
in a limited sense, but Harry's adoptive parents did not fall into
that legal category.</p>
<p>It seemed that Harry was effectively an orphan in the eyes of
the wizarding world. As such, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, or his
designees <i>within</i> the school system, were Harry's guardians
until he graduated. Harry <i>could</i> breathe without Dumbledore's
permission, but only so long as the Headmaster did not specifically
prohibit it.</p>
<p>Harry had then asked if he could simply <i>tell</i> Griphook how
to diversify his investments beyond stacks of gold coins sitting in
his vault.</p>
<p>Griphook had stared blankly and asked what 'diversify'
meant.</p>
<p>Banks, it seemed, did not make investments. Banks stored your
gold coins in secure vaults for an annual fee.</p>
<p>The wizarding world did not have a concept of stock. Or equity.
Or corporations. Businesses were run by families out of their
personal vaults.</p>
<p>Loans were made by rich people, not banks. Though Gringotts
would witness the contract, for a fee, and enforce its collection,
for a much larger fee.</p>
<p>Good rich people let their friends borrow money and pay it back
whenever. <i>Bad</i> rich people charged you <i>interest.</i></p>
<p>There was no secondary market in loans.</p>
<p>Evil rich people charged you annual interest rates of at least
20%.</p>
<p>Harry had stood up, turned away, and rested his head against the
wall.</p>
<p>Harry had asked if he needed the Headmaster's permission before
he could start a bank.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had interrupted at this point, saying that it
was time for lunch, and swiftly conducted a fuming Harry out of the
bronze doors of Gringotts, through Diagon Alley, and to a fine
restaurant called Mary's Place, where a room had been reserved for
them. The owner had looked shocked at seeing Professor Quirrell
accompanied by Harry Potter, but had conducted them to the room
without complaint.</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell had quite deliberately announced that he
would pay the bill, seeming to rather enjoy the look on Harry's
face.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell to the waitress, "we will not
require menus. I will have the daily special accompanied by a
bottle of Chianti, and Mr. Potter will have the Diracawl soup to
start, followed by a plate of Roopo balls, and treacle pudding for
dessert."</p>
<p>The waitress, clad in robes that still looked severe and formal
while being rather shorter than usual, bowed respectfully and
departed, shutting the door behind her.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell waved a hand in the direction of the door,
and a bolt slid shut. "Note the bolt on the inside. This room, Mr.
Potter, is known as Mary's Room. It happens to be proof against all
scrying, and I do mean <i>all;</i> Dumbledore himself could detect
nothing of what happens here. Mary's Room is used by two kinds of
people. The first sort are engaged in illicit dalliances. And the
second sort lead interesting lives."</p>
<p>"<i>Really,</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded.</p>
<p>Harry's lips were parted in anticipation. "It would be a waste
to just sit here and eat lunch, then, without doing anything
special."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell grinned, then took out his wand and flicked
it in the direction of the door. "Of course," he said, "people who
lead interesting lives take precautions more <i>thorough</i> than
the dalliers. I have just sealed us in. Nothing will now pass in or
out of this room - through the crack under the door, for example.
And..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell then spoke no fewer than four different
Charms, none of which Harry recognized.</p>
<p>"Even that does not <i>really</i> suffice," said Professor
Quirrell. "If we were doing anything of truly great import, it
would be necessary to perform another twenty-three checks besides
those. If, say, Rita Skeeter knew or guessed that we would come
here, it is possible that she could be in this room wearing the
true Cloak of Invisibility. Or she could be an Animagus with a tiny
form, perhaps. There are tests to rule out such rare possibilities,
but to perform all of them would be arduous. Still, I wonder if I
should do them anyway, just so as not to teach you bad habits?" And
Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek, looking
abstracted.</p>
<p>"It's fine," Harry said, "I understand, and I'll remember."
Though he was a little disappointed that they weren't doing
anything of truly great import.</p>
<p>"Very well," Professor Quirrell said. He leaned back in his
chair, smiling broadly. "You wrought quite well today, Mr. Potter.
The basic notion was yours, I'm sure, even if you delegated the
execution. I don't think we'll be hearing much more from Rita
Skeeter after this. Lucius Malfoy will not be pleased with her
failure. If she's smart, she'll flee the country the instant she
realizes she's been fooled."</p>
<p>A sinking sensation began to dawn in Harry's stomach. "Lucius
was behind Rita Skeeter...?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you didn't realize that?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't thought about what would happen to Rita Skeeter
afterward.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Not in the slightest.</p>
<p>But she would get fired from her job, <i>of course</i> she would
be fired, she might have children going through Hogwarts for all
Harry knew, and now it was worse, much worse -</p>
<p>"Is Lucius going to have her killed?" Harry said in a barely
audible voice. Somewhere in his head, the Sorting Hat was screaming
at him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell smiled dryly. "If you have not dealt with
journalists before, take it from me that the world gets a little
brighter every time one dies."</p>
<p>Harry jumped out of his chair with a convulsive movement, he had
to find Rita Skeeter and warn her before it was too late -</p>
<p>"<i>Sit down</i>," Professor Quirrell said sharply. "<i>No</i>,
Lucius won't kill her. But Lucius makes life <i>extremely</i>
unpleasant for those who serve him ill. Miss Skeeter will flee and
start her life over with a new name. <i>Sit down,</i> Mr. Potter;
there is nothing you can do at this point, and you have a lesson to
learn."</p>
<p>Harry sat down, slowly. There was a disappointed, annoyed look
on Professor Quirrell's face that was doing more to stop him than
the words.</p>
<p>"There are times," Professor Quirrell said, his voice cutting,
"when I worry that your brilliant Slytherin mind is simply wasted
on you. Repeat after me. Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting
woman."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting woman," Harry said. He
wasn't comfortable saying it, but there didn't seem to be any other
possible actions, none at all.</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter tried to destroy my reputation, but I executed an
ingenious plan and destroyed <i>her</i> reputation first."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter challenged me. She lost the game, and I won."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter was an obstacle to my future plans. I had no
choice but to deal with her if I wanted those plans to
succeed."</p>
<p>"Rita Skeeter was my enemy."</p>
<p>"I cannot possibly get anything done in life if I am not willing
to defeat my enemies."</p>
<p>"I have defeated one of my enemies today."</p>
<p>"I am a good boy."</p>
<p>"I deserve a special reward."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Professor Quirrell, who had been grinning a
benevolent smile for the last few lines, "I see I have succeeded in
catching your attention."</p>
<p>That was true. And while Harry felt like he was being railroaded
into something - no, that wasn't just a feeling, he <i>had</i> been
railroaded - he couldn't deny that saying those things, and seeing
Professor Quirrell's smile, <i>did</i> make him feel better.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell reached into his robes, the gesture slow and
deliberately significant, and drew forth...</p>
<p>...a <i>book</i>.</p>
<p>It was different from any book Harry had ever seen, the edges
and corners visibly misshapen; <i>rough-hewn</i> was the phrase
that came to mind, like it had been hacked out of a book mine.</p>
<p>"What is it?" breathed Harry.</p>
<p>"A diary," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Whose?"</p>
<p>"That of a famous person." Professor Quirrell was smiling
broadly.</p>
<p>"Okay..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression became more serious. "Mr.
Potter, one of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an
excellent memory. The key to a puzzle is often something you read
twenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on
the finger of a man you met only once. I mention this to explain
how I managed to remember this item, and the placard attached to
it, after meeting you a good deal later. You see, Mr. Potter, over
the course of my life, I have viewed a number of private
collections held by individuals who are, perhaps, not quite
deserving of all that they have -"</p>
<p>"You <i>stole</i> it?" Harry said incredulously.</p>
<p>"That is correct," said Professor Quirrell. "Very recently, in
fact. I think you will appreciate this particular item much more
than the vile little man who held it for no other purpose than
impressing his equally vile friends with its rarity."</p>
<p>Harry was simply gaping now.</p>
<p>"But if you feel that my actions were incorrect, Mr. Potter, I
suppose you needn't accept your special present. Though of course I
shan't go to the trouble of stealing it <i>back</i>. So which is it
to be?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell tossed the book from one hand to another,
causing Harry to reach out involuntarily with a look of dismay.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Professor Quirrell, "don't worry about a little rough
handling. You could toss this diary in a fireplace and it would
emerge unscathed. In any case, I await your decision."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell casually threw the book up into the air and
caught it again, grinning.</p>
<p><i>No,</i> said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><i>Yes</i>, said Ravenclaw. <i>What part of the word 'book' did
you two not understand?</i></p>
<p><i>The theft part,</i> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><i>Oh, come on,</i> said Ravenclaw, <i>you can't seriously ask
us to say no and spend the rest of our life wondering what it
was.</i></p>
<p><i>It sounds like a net positive from a utilitarian
standpoint,</i> said Slytherin. <i>Think of it as an economic
transaction which generates gains from trade, only without the
trade part.</i> <i>Plus,</i> we <i>didn't steal it and it won't
help anyone to have Professor Quirrell keep it.</i></p>
<p><i>He's trying to turn you Dark!</i> shrieked Gryffindor, and
Hufflepuff nodded firmly.</p>
<p><i>Don't be a naive little boy,</i> said Slytherin, <i>he's
trying to teach you Slytherin.</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah,</i> said Ravenclaw. <i>Whoever owned the book
originally was probably a Death Eater or something. It belongs with
us.<br /></i></p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened, then halted that way, an agonized look on
his face.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell seemed to be quite enjoying himself. He had
balanced the book on its corner, on one finger, and was keeping it
upright while humming a little tune.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>
<p>The book vanished back into Professor Quirrell's robes, and he
rose up from his chair. Professor Quirrell started to walk over to
the door -</p>
<p>- and staggered, suddenly lurching into the wall.</p>
<p>"It's all right," said Professor Quirrell's voice, which
suddenly sounded a lot weaker than usual. "Sit down, Mr. Potter,
it's just a dizzy spell. Sit down."</p>
<p>Harry's fingers gripped the edge of his chair, uncertain as to
what he should do, what he <i>could</i> do. Harry couldn't even get
too close to Professor Quirrell, not unless he wanted to defy that
sense of Doom -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell straightened, then, his breathing seeming a
bit heavy, and opened the door.</p>
<p>The waitress came in, bearing a platter of food; and as she
distributed the plates, Professor Quirrell walked slowly back to
the table.</p>
<p>But by the time the waitress had bowed her way out, Professor
Quirrell was sitting upright and smiling again.</p>
<p>Still, the brief episode of whatever-it-was had decided Harry.
He couldn't say no, not after Professor Quirrell had gone to that
much trouble.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell held up a cautioning finger, then took out
his wand again, locked the door again, and repeated three of the
same Charms from earlier.</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell took the book back out of his robes and
tossed it to Harry, who almost dropped it into his soup.</p>
<p>Harry shot Professor Quirrell a look of helpless indignation.
You weren't supposed to <i>do</i> that with books, enchanted or
not.</p>
<p>Harry opened the book with ingrained, instinctive care. The
pages seemed too thick, with a texture unlike either Muggle paper
or wizarding parchment. And the contents were...</p>
<p>...blank?</p>
<p>"Am I supposed to be seeing -"</p>
<p>"Look nearer the beginning," said Professor Quirrell, and Harry
(again with that helpless, ingrained care) turned a block of pages
back.</p>
<p>The lettering was obviously handwritten, and very hard to read,
but Harry thought the words might be Latin.</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> this?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"That," said Professor Quirrell, "is a record of the magical
researches of a Muggleborn who never came to Hogwarts. He refused
his letter, and conducted his own small investigations, which never
did get very far without a wand. From the description on the
placard, I expect that his name bears rather more significance to
you than to me. That, Harry Potter, is the diary of Roger
Bacon."</p>
<p>Harry almost fainted.</p>
<p>Nestled up against the wall, where Professor Quirrell had
stumbled, glistened the crushed remains of a beautiful blue
beetle.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon lived in the 13th century and is credited as one of
the earliest advocates of the scientific method. Giving a scientist
his experimental diary is sort of like giving a writer the pen, not
of Shakespeare, but of someone who helped invent writing.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It wasn't every day you got to see Harry Potter beg.</p>
<p>"<i>Pleeaaase,</i>" whined Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Fred and George shook their heads again, smiling.</p>
<p>There was an agonized look on Harry Potter's face. "But I
<i>told</i> you how I did the one with Kevin Entwhistle's cat, and
Hermione and the vanishing soda, and I <i>can't</i> tell you about
the Sorting Hat or the Remembrall or Professor Snape..."</p>
<p>Fred and George shrugged and turned to leave.</p>
<p>"If you ever do figure it out," said the Weasley twins, "be sure
to let us know."</p>
<p>"<i>You're evil! You're both evil!</i>"</p>
<p>Fred and George firmly closed the door to the empty classroom
behind them, and made sure to keep the grin on their faces for a
while, just in case Harry Potter could see through doors.</p>
<p>Then they turned a corner and their faces sagged.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose Harry's guesses -"</p>
<p>"- gave you any ideas?" they said to each other at the same
time, and then their shoulders slumped further.</p>
<p>Their last relevant memory was of Flume refusing to help them,
though they couldn't remember <i>what</i> they'd asked him to
do...</p>
<p>...but they must have looked elsewhere and found <i>someone</i>
to help them do <i>something</i> illegal, or they wouldn't have
agreed to be Obliviated afterward.</p>
<p>How had they <i>possibly</i> been able to get all that done on
just forty Galleons?</p>
<p>At first they'd worried that they'd forged evidence so good that
Harry actually <i>would</i> end up married to Ginny... but they'd
thought of that too, it seemed. The Wizengamot proceedings had been
tampered with <i>again</i> to put them back the way they'd been
originally, the fake betrothal contract had vanished from its
dragon-guarded vault in Gringotts, and so on. It was pretty scary,
actually. Most people now thought the <i>Daily Prophet</i> had just
made the whole thing up for unguessable reasons, and the
<i>Quibbler</i> had helpfully twisted the knife deeper with the
next day's headline, HARRY POTTER SECRETLY BETROTHED TO LUNA
LOVEGOOD.</p>
<p>Whoever they'd hired would tell them after the statute of
limitations expired, they desperately hoped. But meanwhile it was
awful, they'd pulled their greatest prank ever, maybe the greatest
prank in the history of pranking, and they <i>couldn't remember
how.</i> It was crazy, they'd been able to think of a way the
<i>first</i> time, so why couldn't they see it now after
<i>knowing</i> everything they'd done?</p>
<p>Their only consolation was that Harry didn't know they didn't
know.</p>
<p>Not even Mum had questioned them about it, despite the obvious
Weasley connection. Whatever had been done, it was far out of the
reach of any Hogwarts student... except possibly <i>one</i>, who,
if certain rumors were true, might have done it by snapping his
fingers. <i>Harry</i> had been questioned under Veritaserum, he'd
told them... with Dumbledore present and giving the Aurors scary
looks. The Aurors had asked just enough to determine that Harry
hadn't pulled the prank himself or disappeared anyone, and then
gotten the heck out of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Fred and George had wondered whether to feel insulted about
Harry Potter being questioned by the Aurors for <i>their</i> prank,
but the look on <i>Harry's</i> face, probably for exactly the same
reason, made everything worth it.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Rita Skeeter and the editor of the <i>Daily
Prophet</i> had both vanished and were probably in another country
by now. They <i>would've</i> liked to be able to tell their family
about that part. Dad would have congratulated them, they thought,
after Mum had finished killing them and Ginny had burned the
remains.</p>
<p>But everything was still all right, they'd tell Dad someday, and
meanwhile...</p>
<p>...meanwhile Dumbledore had happened to sneeze while passing
them in the hallway, and a small package had accidentally dropped
out of his pockets, and inside had been two matched wardbreaker's
monocles of <i>incredible</i> quality. The Weasley twins had tested
their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making
a quick trip to the magic mirror and back, and they hadn't been
able to see <i>all</i> the detection webs clearly, but the monocles
had shown a <i>lot</i> more than they'd seen the first time.</p>
<p>Of course they would have to be very careful never to get caught
with the monocles in their possession, or they would end up in the
Headmaster's office getting a stern lecture and maybe even threats
of expulsion.</p>
<p>It was good to know that not everyone who got Sorted into
Gryffindor grew up to be Professor McGonagall.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry was in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting
before a desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of
solid black.</p>
<p>The room was screened against detection, and the man had
performed exactly twenty-seven spells before saying so much as
"Hello, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>It was oddly appropriate that the man in black was about to try
reading Harry's mind.</p>
<p>"Prepare yourself," the man said tonelessly.</p>
<p>A human mind, Harry's Occlumency book had said, was only exposed
to a Legilimens along certain <i>surfaces</i>. If you failed to
defend your surfaces, the Legilimens would go <i>through</i> and be
able to access any part of you which their own mind was able to
comprehend...</p>
<p>...which tended not to be much. Human minds, it seemed, were
hard for humans to understand on any level but the shallowest.
Harry had wondered if knowing lots of cognitive science could make
him an incredibly powerful Legilimens, but repeated experience had
<i>finally</i> driven into him the lesson that he needed to get a
little less excited in his anticipations about this sort of thing.
It wasn't as if any cognitive scientist understood humans well
enough to make one.</p>
<p>To learn the counter, Occlumency, the first step was to imagine
yourself to be a different person, pretending it as thoroughly as
you could, immersing yourself entirely in that alternate persona.
You wouldn't always have to do that, but in the beginning, it was
how you learned where your surfaces were. The Legilimens would try
to read you, and you would feel it happening if you paid close
enough attention, you would sense them trying to enter. And your
job was to make sure that they always touched your imaginary
persona and not the real one.</p>
<p>When you were good enough at that, you could imagine being a
very <i>simple</i> sort of person, pretend to be a rock, and make a
habit of leaving the pretense in place where all your surfaces
were. That was a standard Occlumency barrier. Pretending to be a
rock was hard to learn, but easy to do afterward, and the exposed
surface of a mind was much shallower than its interior, so with
enough practice you could keep it up as a background habit.</p>
<p>Or if you were a <i>perfect Occlumens</i>, you could race
<i>ahead</i> of any probes, answering queries as fast as they were
asked, so that the Legilimens would enter through your surfaces and
see a mind indistinguishable from whoever you were pretending to
be.</p>
<p>Even the best Legilimens could be fooled that way. If a perfect
Occlumens claimed they were dropping their Occlumency barriers,
there was no way to know if they were lying. Worse, you might not
know you were dealing with a perfect Occlumens. They were rare, but
the fact that they existed meant you couldn't trust Legilimency on
<i>anyone.</i></p>
<p>It was a sad commentary on how little human beings understood
each other, how little any wizard comprehended the depths lying
beneath the mind's surface, that you could fool the best human
telepaths by pretending to be someone else.</p>
<p>But then human beings only understood each other in the first
place by pretending. You didn't make predictions about people by
modeling the hundred trillion synapses in their brain as separate
objects. Ask the best social manipulator on Earth to build you an
Artificial Intelligence from scratch, and they'd just give you a
dumb look. You predicted people by telling <i>your</i> brain to act
like theirs. You <i>put yourself in their place</i>. If you wanted
to know what an angry person would do, you activated your own
brain's anger circuitry, and whatever that circuitry output, that
was your prediction. What did the neural circuitry for anger
actually look like inside? Who knew? The best social manipulator on
Earth might not know what neurons <i>were</i>, and neither might
the best Legilimens.</p>
<p>Anything a Legilimens could <i>understand</i>, an Occlumens
could <i>pretend</i> to be. It was the same trick either way -
probably implemented by the same neural circuitry in both cases, a
single set of control circuits for reconfiguring your own brain to
act as a model of someone else's.</p>
<p>And so the race between telepathic offense and telepathic
defense had been a decisive win for defense. Otherwise the entire
magical world, maybe even the whole Earth, would have been a very
different place...</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and concentrated. There was a slight
smile on his face.</p>
<p>For <i>once,</i> just <i>once,</i> Harry hadn't gotten
shortchanged in the mysterious powers department.</p>
<p>After almost a month of work, and more on a whim than any real
hunch, Harry had decided to make himself coldly angry and then try
the book's Occlumency exercises again. At that point he'd mostly
given up hope on that sort of thing, but it had still seemed worth
a quick try -</p>
<p>He'd run through all the book's hardest exercises in two hours,
and the next day he'd gone and told Professor Quirrell he was
ready.</p>
<p>His dark side, it had turned out, was very, <i>very</i> good at
pretending to be other people.</p>
<p>Harry thought of his standard trigger, from the first time he'd
gone over entirely to his dark side...</p>
<p><i>Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. "And that
will be... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from
Ravenclaw for backchat."</i></p>
<p>Harry's smile grew chillier, and he regarded the black-robed man
who thought he was going to read Harry's mind.</p>
<p>And then Harry turned into someone else entirely, someone who
had seemed appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p>...in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a
desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid
black.</p>
<p>Kimball Kinnison regarded the black-robed man who thought he was
going to read the mind of a Second-Stage Lensman of the Galactic
Patrol.</p>
<p>To say that Kimball Kinnison was confident of the outcome would
be an understatement. He had been trained by Mentor of Arisia, the
most powerful mind known to this or any other universe, and the
mere wizard sitting across from him would see precisely what the
Gray Lensman wanted him to see...</p>
<p>...the mind of the boy he was currently disguised as, an
innocent child named Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"I'm ready," said Kimball Kinnison in nervous tones that were
exactly appropriate for an eleven-year-old boy.</p>
<p>"<i>Legilimens,</i>" said the black-robed wizard.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The black-robed wizard blinked, as if he'd seen something so
shocking that it had been enough to make even <i>his</i> eyelids
move. His voice wasn't quite toneless as he said, "The
Boy-Who-Lived has a <i>mysterious dark side?</i>"</p>
<p>The heat slowly crept up into Harry's cheeks.</p>
<p>"Well," the man said. His face had now settled back into perfect
calm. "Excuse me. Mr. Potter, it is good to know your advantages,
but that is not the same as being wildly overconfident in them. You
may indeed be able to learn Occlumency at eleven years of age. This
astounds me. I had thought Mr. Dumbledore was pretending to be
insane again. Your dissociative talent is so strong that I am
surprised to find no other signs of childhood abuse, and you may
become a perfect Occlumens in time. But there is a considerable
difference between that and expecting to put up a successful
Occlumency barrier on your first attempt. That is merely
ridiculous. Did you feel anything as I read your mind?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, now blushing furiously.</p>
<p>"Then pay closer attention next time. The goal is not to create
a perfect image on your first day of lessons. The goal is to learn
where your surfaces are. Prepare yourself."</p>
<p>Harry tried to pretend to be Kimball Kinnison again, tried to
pay more attention, but his thoughts were a little scattered and he
was suddenly aware of all the things he shouldn't be thinking
about...</p>
<p>Oh, this was going to suck.</p>
<p>Harry gritted his teeth. At least the instructor would be
Obliviated afterward.</p>
<p>"<i>Legilimens.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>...in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a
desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid
black.</p>
<p>It was their fourth day, on a Sunday evening. When you paid this
much, you got your sessions any darned time you wanted, never mind
the concept of weekends.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Potter," the telepath said tonelessly, having cast
the full suite of privacy spells.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Bester," Harry said wearily. "Let's just get the
initial shock out of the way, shall we?"</p>
<p>"You managed to surprise me?" the man said, now sounding
slightly interested. "Well then." He pointed his wand and stared
into Harry's eyes. "<i>Legilimens.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then the black-robed wizard jerked as if
someone had touched him with a cattle prod.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord is <i>alive?</i>" he choked. His eyes were
suddenly wild. "<i>Dumbledore turns himself invisible and sneaks
into girls' dorm rooms?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry sighed and looked down at his watch. In about another
three seconds...</p>
<p>"So," the man said. He hadn't quite recovered his tonelessness.
"You genuinely believe you're going to discover the secret rules of
magic and become all-powerful."</p>
<p>"That's right," Harry said evenly, still looking at his watch.
"I'm <i>that</i> overconfident."</p>
<p>"I wonder. It seems the Sorting Hat thinks you'll be the next
Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"And <i>you</i> know I'm trying pretty hard <i>not</i> to be,
and you saw that we already had a long discussion about whether you
were willing to teach me Occlumency, and in the end you decided to
do it, so can we just get this over with?"</p>
<p>"All right," said the man exactly six seconds later, same as
last time. "Prepare yourself." He paused, and then said, his voice
rather wistful, "Though I <i>do</i> wish I could remember that
trick with the gold and silver."</p>
<p>Harry was finding himself very disturbed by how reproducible
human thoughts were when you reset people back to the same initial
conditions and exposed them to the same stimuli. It was dispelling
illusions that a good reductionist wasn't supposed to have in the
first place.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry was in a rather bad mood as he stomped out of his
Herbology class the next Monday morning.</p>
<p>Hermione was seething alongside him.</p>
<p>The other children were still inside, a bit slow to assemble
their things because they were gibbering excitedly to each other
about Ravenclaw winning the year's second Quidditch match.</p>
<p>It seemed that last night after dinner, a girl had flown around
on a broomstick for thirty minutes and then caught some sort of
giant mosquito. There were other facts about what had happened
during this match, but they were irrelevant.</p>
<p>Harry had missed this exciting sports event due to his
Occlumency lesson, and also having a life.</p>
<p>He had then avoided all conversations in the Ravenclaw dorm,
weren't Quieting Charms and magical trunks wonderful. He had eaten
breakfast at the Gryffindor table.</p>
<p>But Harry couldn't avoid Herbology, and the Ravenclaws had
talked about it before class, and after class, and <i>during
class,</i> until Harry had looked up from the baby furcot whose
diaper he was changing, and announced loudly that some of them were
trying to learn about <i>plants</i> and Snitches didn't grow on
anything so could they all <i>please</i> shut up about Quidditch.
Everyone else present had given him shocked looks, except Hermione,
who'd looked like she wanted to applaud, and Professor Sprout, who
had awarded him a point for Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><i>A</i> point for Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><i>One</i> point.</p>
<p>The seven idiots on their idiot brooms playing their idiot game
had earned <i>one hundred and ninety points</i> for Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>It seemed that Quidditch scores <i>added directly onto the House
points total.</i></p>
<p>In other words, catching a golden mosquito was worth 150 House
points.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't even <i>imagine</i> what he would have to do to
earn one hundred and fifty House points.</p>
<p>Besides, y'know, rescuing <i>a hundred and fifty
Hufflepuffs,</i> or coming up with <i>fifteen ideas as good as
putting protective shells on time machines,</i> or inventing <i>one
thousand five hundred creative ways to kill people,</i> or being
Hermione Granger for the <i>entire year</i>.</p>
<p>"We should kill them," Harry said to Hermione, who was walking
beside him with an equally offended air.</p>
<p>"Who?" said Hermione. "The Quidditch team?"</p>
<p>"I was thinking of everyone involved in any way with Quidditch
anywhere, but the Ravenclaw team would be a start, yes."</p>
<p>Hermione's lips were pursed disapprovingly. "You <i>do</i> know
that killing people is wrong, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Okay, just checking," Hermione said. "Let's get the Seeker
first. I've read some Agatha Christie mysteries, do you know how we
can get her onto a train?"</p>
<p>"Two students plotting murder," said a dry voice. "How
shocking."</p>
<p>From around a nearby corner strolled a man in lightly spotted
robes, his greasy hair falling long and unkempt about his
shoulders. Deadly danger seemed to radiate out from him, filling
the hallway with improperly mixed potions and accidental falls and
people dying in bed of what the Aurors would rule to be natural
causes.</p>
<p>Without thinking about it at all, Harry stepped in front of
Hermione.</p>
<p>There was an intake of breath from behind him, and then a moment
later Hermione brushed past and stepped in front of <i>him.</i>
"Run, Harry!" she said. "Boys shouldn't have to be in danger."</p>
<p>Severus Snape smiled mirthlessly. "Amusing. I request a moment
of your time, Potter, if you can tear yourself away from your
flirtations with Miss Granger."</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a very worried look on Hermione's face. She
turned to Harry and opened her mouth, then paused, looking
distressed.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry, Miss Granger," said Severus's silky voice. "I
promise to return your beau unmaimed." His smile vanished. "Now
Potter and I are about to go off and have a private conversation,
just by ourselves. I hope it is clear that you are not invited, but
just in case, consider that an order from a Hogwarts professor. I'm
sure a good little girl like you won't disobey."</p>
<p>And Severus turned and walked back around the corner. "Coming,
Potter?" his voice said.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said to Hermione. "Can I just sort of go off and
follow him and let <i>you</i> work out what I should say to make
sure you're not all worried and offended?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said, her voice trembling.</p>
<p>Severus's laughter echoed from around the corner.</p>
<p>Harry bowed his head. "Sorry," he said lowly, "really," and he
went off after the Potions Master.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"So," Harry said. There were no other sounds now but two pairs
of legs, the long and the short, padding across a random stone
corridor. The Potions Master was striding quickly but not too fast
for Harry to keep up, and insofar as Harry could apply the concept
of directionality to Hogwarts, they were moving away from the
frequented areas. "What's this about?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you could explain," Severus said dryly, "why
the two of you were plotting to murder Cho Chang?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose <i>you</i> could explain," Harry said dryly,
"in your capacity as an official of the Hogwarts school system, why
catching a golden mosquito is deemed an academic accomplishment
worthy of a hundred and fifty House points?"</p>
<p>A smile crossed Severus's lips. "Dear me, and I thought you were
supposed to be perceptive. Are you truly so incapable of
understanding your classmates, Potter, or do you dislike them too
much to try? If Quidditch scores did not count toward the House Cup
then none of them would care about House points at all. It would
merely be an obscure contest for students like you and Miss
Granger."</p>
<p>It was a shockingly good answer.</p>
<p>And that shock brought Harry's mind fully awake.</p>
<p>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that Severus
understood his students, understood them very well indeed.</p>
<p>He had been reading their minds.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>...the book said that a successful Legilimens was extremely
rare, rarer than a perfect Occlumens, because almost no one had
enough mental discipline.</p>
<p><i>Mental discipline?</i></p>
<p>Harry had collected stories about a man who routinely lost his
temper in class and blew up at young children.</p>
<p>...but this same man, when Harry had spoken of the Dark Lord
still being alive, had responded instantly and perfectly - reacting
in precisely the way that someone completely ignorant would
react.</p>
<p>The man stalked about Hogwarts with the air of an assassin,
radiating danger...</p>
<p>...which was exactly <i>not</i> what a real assassin should do.
Real assassins should look like meek little accountants until they
killed you.</p>
<p>He was the Head of House for proud and aristocratic Slytherin,
and he wore a robe with spotted stains from bits of potions and
ingredients, which two minutes of magic could have removed.</p>
<p>Harry noticed that he was confused.</p>
<p>And his threat estimate of the <i>Head of House Slytherin</i>
shot up astronomically.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had seemed to think Severus was his, and there'd been
nothing to contradict that; the Potions Master had been "scary but
not abusive", as promised. So, Harry had reasoned earlier, this was
Fellowship business. If Severus had been planning harm, surely he
wouldn't have come to get Harry in front of Hermione, a witness,
when he could have simply waited for some time when Harry was
alone...</p>
<p>Harry quietly bit his lip.</p>
<p>"I once knew a boy who truly adored Quidditch," said Severus
Snape. "He was an utter pillock. Just as you and I would expect, we
two."</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> this?" Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"Patience, Potter."</p>
<p>Severus turned his head, and then glided with his assassin's
bearing into a nearby opening in the corridor walls, a smaller and
narrower hallway leading off.</p>
<p>Harry followed him, wondering if it would be smarter to simply
run away.</p>
<p>They turned and made another turn, and came to a dead end, a
simple blank wall. If Hogwarts had actually been built, rather than
conjured or summoned or birthed or whatever, Harry would have had
some sharp words for the architect about paying people to build
hallways that didn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>"<i>Quietus,</i>" said Severus, and a few other things as
well.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back, folded his arms across his chest, and watched
Severus's face.</p>
<p>"Looking me in the eyes, Potter?" said Severus Snape. "Your
Occlumency lessons cannot have progressed far enough for you to
block Legilimency. But then perhaps they have progressed far enough
for you to detect it. Since I cannot know otherwise, I will not
risk trying." The man smiled thinly. "And the same will hold for
Dumbledore, I think. Which is why we are <i>now</i> having this
little talk."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened involuntarily.</p>
<p>"To begin with," Severus said, eyes glittering, "I should like
you to promise not to speak of our conversations to <i>anyone</i>.
So far as the school is concerned, we are discussing your Potions
homework. Whether or not they believe that is unimportant. So far
as Dumbledore and McGonagall are concerned, I am violating Draco
Malfoy's confidences in me, and neither of us think it proper to
speak further of the particulars."</p>
<p>Harry's brain tried to calculate the ramifications and
implications of this and ran out of swap space.</p>
<p>"Well?" said the Potions Master.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said slowly. It was hard to see how having a
conversation and being unable to tell anyone could be more
constraining than <i>not</i> having it, in which case you
<i>also</i> couldn't tell anyone the contents. "I promise."</p>
<p>Severus was watching Harry intently. "You said once in the
Headmaster's office that you would not tolerate bullying or abuse.
And so I wonder, Harry Potter. Just how much do you resemble your
father?"</p>
<p>"Unless we're talking about Michael Verres-Evans," Harry said,
"the answer is that I know very little about James Potter."</p>
<p>Severus nodded, as though to himself. "There is a fifth-year
Slytherin. A boy named Lesath Lestrange. He is being bullied by
Gryffindors. I am... constrained, in my ability to deal with such
situations. <i>You</i> could help him, perhaps. If you wished. I am
not asking you for a favor, and will not owe you one. It is simply
an opportunity to do as you will."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Severus, thinking.</p>
<p>"Wondering if it's a trap?" said Severus, a faint smile crossing
his lips. "It is not. It <i>is</i> a test. Call it curiosity on my
part. But Lesath's troubles are real, as are my own difficulties in
intervening."</p>
<p>That was the trouble with other people knowing you were a good
guy. Even if you knew they knew, you still couldn't ignore the
bait.</p>
<p>And if his father had protected students from bullies too... it
didn't matter if Harry knew why Severus had told him. It still made
him feel warm inside, and proud, and made it impossible to walk
away.</p>
<p>"Fine," Harry said. "Tell me about Lesath. Why is he being
bullied?"</p>
<p>Severus's face lost the faint smile. "You think there are
<i>reasons</i>, Potter?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," Harry said quietly. "But the thought had occurred
to me that he might have pushed some unimportant mudblood girl down
the stairs."</p>
<p>"Lesath Lestrange," Severus said, his voice now cold, "is the
son of Bellatrix Black, the most fanatic and evil servant of the
Dark Lord. Lesath is the acknowledged bastard of Rabastan
Lestrange. Shortly after the Dark Lord's death, Bellatrix and
Rabastan and Rabastan's brother Rodolphus were captured while
torturing Alice and Frank Longbottom. All three are in Azkaban for
life. The Longbottoms were driven insane by repeated Cruciatus and
remain in St. Mungo's incurable ward. Is any of that a good reason
to bully him, Potter?"</p>
<p>"It is no reason at all," Harry said, still quietly. "And Lesath
himself has done no wrong that you know?"</p>
<p>The faint smile crossed Severus's lips again. "He is no more a
saint than anyone else. But he has pushed no mudblood girls down
the stairs, not that I ever heard."</p>
<p>"Or saw in his mind," said Harry.</p>
<p>Severus's expression was chill. "I did not invade his privacy,
Potter. I looked within the Gryffindors, rather. He is simply a
convenient target for their little satisfactions."</p>
<p>A cold wash of anger ran down Harry's spine, and he had to
remind himself that Severus might not be a trustworthy source of
information.</p>
<p>"And you think," Harry said, "that an intervention by Harry
Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, might prove effective."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Severus Snape, and told Harry when and where the
Gryffindors were planning their next little game.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>There is a main hallway running through the middle of Hogwarts's
second floor on the north-south axis, and near the center of this
hallway there is an opening into a short corridor which goes a
dozen paces back before turning at a right angle, making an
L-shape, and then goes a dozen paces more before it ends at a
bright, wide window, looking out from three stories above upon the
light drizzle falling over the east grounds of Hogwarts. Standing
by the window you can hear nothing of the main hallway, and no one
in the hallway would hear what went on by the window. If you think
there is anything odd about this, you haven't been in Hogwarts very
long.</p>
<p>Four boys in red-trimmed robes are laughing, and a boy in
green-trimmed robes is screaming and grabbing frantically onto the
edges of the opened window with his hands, as the four boys make as
though to push him out. It's just a joke, of course, and besides, a
fall from that height wouldn't kill a wizard. All good fun. If you
think there is anything odd about this -</p>
<p>"<i>What are you doing?</i>" says a sixth boy's voice.</p>
<p>The four boys in red-trimmed robes spin around with sudden
starts, and the boy in green-trimmed robes frantically pushes
himself away from the window and falls to the floor, face streaked
with tears.</p>
<p>"Oh," says the most handsome of the boys in red-trimmed robes,
sounding relieved, "it's <i>you.</i> Hey, Lessy, you know who this
is?"</p>
<p>There isn't any answer from the boy on the floor, who's trying
to get his sniffling under control, and the boy in the red-trimmed
robes draws back his leg for a kick -</p>
<p>"<i>Stop it!</i>" shouts the sixth boy.</p>
<p>The boy in the red-trimmed robes wobbles as he aborts the kick.
"Um," he says, "do <i>you</i> know who this is?"</p>
<p>The sixth boy's breathing sounds strange. "Lesath Lestrange," he
says, his breath coming in short pants, "and <i>he</i> didn't do
anything to my parents, he was five years old."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Neville Longbottom stared at the four huge fifth-year bullies in
front of him, trying very hard to control his trembling.</p>
<p>He should have just told Harry Potter no.</p>
<p>"Why are <i>you</i> defending him?" said the handsome one,
slowly, sounding puzzled with the first hints of offense. "He's a
<i>Slytherin.</i> And a <i>Lestrange.</i>"</p>
<p>"He's a boy who lost his parents," said Neville Longbottom. "I
know how that is." He didn't know where the words had come from. It
sounded too cool, like something Harry Potter would say.</p>
<p>The trembling went on, though.</p>
<p>"<i>Who</i> do you think you <i>are?</i>" said the handsome
one, starting to sound angry.</p>
<p><i>I am Neville, the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient
House of Longbottom -</i></p>
<p>Neville couldn't say it.</p>
<p>"I think he's a <i>traitor</i>," said one of the other
Gryffindors, and there was a sudden sinking sensation in Neville's
stomach.</p>
<p>He'd known it, he'd just known it. Harry Potter had been wrong
after all. Bullies wouldn't stop only because Neville Longbottom
told them to stop.</p>
<p>The handsome one took a step forward, and the three others
followed.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is for you," Neville said, amazed at how
steady his voice was. "It doesn't matter to you if it's Lesath
Lestrange or Neville Longbottom."</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange let out a sudden gasp, from where he was lying
on the floor.</p>
<p>"Evil is evil," snarled the same boy who'd spoken before, "and
if you're friends with evil, you're evil too."</p>
<p>The four took another step forward.</p>
<p>Lesath rose, wobbling, to his feet. His face was gray, and he
took a few steps forward, and leaned against the wall, and didn't
say anything. His eyes were fixed on the turn in the hallway, the
way out.</p>
<p>"Friends," Neville said. Now his voice was going up a bit in
pitch. "Yes, I have friends. One of them is the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>A couple of the Gryffindors looked suddenly worried. The
handsome one didn't flinch. "Harry Potter isn't here," he said, his
voice hard, "and if he was, I don't think he'd like to see a
Longbottom defending a Lestrange."</p>
<p>And the Gryffindors took another long step forward, and behind
them, Lesath crept along the wall, waiting for his chance.</p>
<p>Neville swallowed, and raised his right hand with his thumb and
forefinger pressed together.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes, because Harry Potter had made him promise not
to peek.</p>
<p>If this didn't work, he was never trusting anyone again.</p>
<p>His voice came out surprisingly clear, considering.</p>
<p>"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. By the debt
that you owe me and the power of your true name I summon you, I
open the way for you, I call upon you to manifest yourself before
me."</p>
<p>Neville snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>And then Neville opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange was staring at him.</p>
<p>The four Gryffindors were staring at him.</p>
<p>The handsome one started to chuckle, and that set off the other
three.</p>
<p>"Was Harry Potter supposed to step around the corner or
something?" said the handsome one. "Aw. Looks like you've been
stood up."</p>
<p>The handsome one took a menacing step forward toward
Neville.</p>
<p>The other three followed in lockstep.</p>
<p>"Ahem," said Harry Potter from behind them, leaning against the
wall by the window, in the dead end of the hallway, where nobody
could possibly have gotten to without being seen.</p>
<p>If watching people scream always felt this good, Neville could
sort of understand why people became bullies.</p>
<p>Harry Potter stalked forward, placing himself between Lesath
Lestrange and the others. He swept his icy gaze across the boys in
red-trimmed robes, and then his eyes came to rest on the handsome
one, the ringleader. "Mr. Carl Sloper," said Harry Potter. "I
believe I have comprehended this situation fully. If Lesath
Lestrange has ever committed a single evil himself, rather than
being born to the wrong parents, the fact is not known to
<i>you.</i> If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Sloper, I suggest you
inform me at once."</p>
<p>Neville saw the fear and awe on the other boys' faces. He was
feeling it himself. Harry had <i>claimed</i> it would all be a
trick, but how could it be?</p>
<p>"But he's a <i>Lestrange</i>," said the ringleader.</p>
<p>"He's a boy who <i>lost his parents</i>," Harry Potter said, his
voice growing even colder.</p>
<p>This time all three of the other Gryffindors flinched.</p>
<p>"So," said Harry Potter. "You saw that Neville didn't want you
tormenting an innocent boy on behalf of the Longbottoms. This
failed to move you. If I tell you that the Boy-Who-Lived
<i>also</i> thinks you are in the wrong, that what you did today
was a terrible mistake, does that make a difference?"</p>
<p>The ringleader took a step toward Harry.</p>
<p>The others did <i>not</i> follow him.</p>
<p>"Carl," one of them said, swallowing. "Maybe we should go."</p>
<p>"They say you're going to be the next Dark Lord," the ringleader
said, staring at Harry.</p>
<p>A grin crossed Harry Potter's face. "They also say I'm secretly
betrothed to Ginevra Weasley and there's a prophecy about us
conquering France." The smile faded. "Since you're determined to
force the issue, Mr. Carl Sloper, let me make things clear.
<i>Leave Lesath alone.</i> I will know if you don't."</p>
<p>"So Lessy snarked to you," said the ringleader coldly.</p>
<p>"Sure," said Harry Potter dryly, "and he also told me what you
did today after you left Charms class, in a private secluded place
where no one could see you, with a certain Hufflepuff girl wearing
a white ribbon in her hair -"</p>
<p>The ringleader's jaw dropped in shock.</p>
<p>"Eep," said one of the other Gryffindors in a high-pitched
voice, and spun on his heels and ran around the corner. His
footsteps rapidly pattered away and faded.</p>
<p>And then there were six.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Harry Potter, "there goes a slightly intelligent
young man. The rest of you could stand to learn from Bertram
Kirke's example, before you get into, shall we say, trouble."</p>
<p>"Are you threatening to snark on us?" said the handsome
Gryffindor, his voice trying to be angry, and rather wavering. "Bad
things happen to snarkers."</p>
<p>The other two Gryffindors started slowly moving back.</p>
<p>Harry Potter started laughing. "Oh, you did not just say that.
Are you <i>really</i> trying to intimidate me? <i>Me?</i> Now
honestly, do you think you're scarier than Peregrine Derrick,
Severus Snape or for that matter You-Know-Who?"</p>
<p>Even the ringleader flinched at that.</p>
<p>Harry Potter raised his hand, fingers poised, and all three of
the Gryffindors leaped backward, and one of them blurted "Don't -
!"</p>
<p>"See," said Harry Potter, "this is where I snap my fingers and
you become part of a hilariously amusing story that will be told
with much nervous laughter at dinner tonight. But the thing is,
people I trust keep telling me not to do that. Professor McGonagall
told me I was taking the easy way out of everything and Professor
Quirrell says I need to learn how to lose. So you remember that
story where I let myself get beaten up by some older Slytherins? We
could do that. You could bully me for a while and I could let you.
Only you remember that part at the end where I tell my many, many
friends inside this school not to do anything about it? This time
we'll skip that part. So go ahead. Bully me."</p>
<p>Harry Potter stepped forward, his arms opened wide in
invitation.</p>
<p>The three Gryffindors broke and ran, and Neville had to sidestep
quickly to avoid getting run over.</p>
<p>There was silence, as their footsteps faded, and then more
silence after that.</p>
<p>And then there were three.</p>
<p>Harry Potter drew a deep breath, then exhaled. "Whew," he said.
"How are you doing, Neville?"</p>
<p>Neville's voice came out in a high-pitched squeak. "Okay,
<i>that</i> was really cool."</p>
<p>A grin flashed across Harry Potter's face. "<i>You</i> were
pretty cool too, you know."</p>
<p>Neville knew that Harry Potter was just saying that, trying to
make him feel good, and it still started a warm glow inside his
chest.</p>
<p>Harry turned toward Lesath Lestrange -</p>
<p>"Are you okay, Lestrange?" said Neville before Harry could open
his mouth.</p>
<p>Now there was something you didn't expect to find yourself
saying, ever.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange turned slowly, and stared at Neville, his face
tight, no longer crying, tears glistening as they dried.</p>
<p>"You think you know how it is?" said Lesath, his voice high and
shaking. "<i>You think you know?</i> My parents are in
<i>Azkaban,</i> I try not to think about it and they always remind
me, they think it's <i>great</i> that Mother is there in the cold
and the dark with the Dementors sucking away her life, I wish I was
like Harry Potter, at least his parents aren't hurting, my parents
are always hurting, every second of every day, I wish I was like
you, at least you can see your parents sometimes, at least you know
they loved you, if Mother ever loved me the Dementors will have
eaten that thought by now -"</p>
<p>Neville's eyes were wide with shock. He hadn't expected
this.</p>
<p>Lesath turned to Harry Potter, whose eyes were full of
horror.</p>
<p>Lesath flung himself on the floor in front of Harry Potter,
touched his forehead to the ground, and whispered, "Help me,
Lord."</p>
<p>There was an awful silence. Neville couldn't think of a single
thing to say, and from the naked shock on Harry's face, he couldn't
think of anything either.</p>
<p>"They say you can do anything, please, please my Lord, get my
parents out of Azkaban, I'll be your loyal servant forever, my life
will be yours and my death as well, only please -"</p>
<p>"Lesath," Harry said, his voice breaking, "Lesath, I can't, I
can't really do things like that, it's all just stupid tricks."</p>
<p>"It's <i>not!</i>" said Lesath, his voice high and desperate.
"I <i>saw</i> it, the stories are true, you <i>can!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Lesath, I set the whole thing up with Neville,
we planned it all out in advance, ask him!"</p>
<p>They had, though Harry hadn't said <i>how</i> he was going to do
any of it...</p>
<p>When Lesath looked up from the floor his face was ghastly, and
his voice came out in a shriek that hurt Neville's ears. "<i>You
son of a mudblood! You could get her out, you just won't! I got
down on my knees and begged you and you still won't help! I should
have known, you're the Boy-Who-Lived, you think she belongs
there!</i>"</p>
<p>"I <i>can't!</i>" Harry said, his voice as desperate as
Lesath's. "It's not a question of what I want, I don't have the
<i>power!</i>"</p>
<p>Lesath rose to his feet, and spat on the floor in front of
Harry, and then turned and walked away. When he was around the
corner the sound of his feet sped up, and as they faded Neville
thought he heard a single sob.</p>
<p>And then there were two.</p>
<p>Neville looked at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry looked at Neville.</p>
<p>"Wow," Neville said quietly. "He didn't seem very grateful for
being rescued."</p>
<p>"He thought I could help him," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "He
had hope for the first time in years."</p>
<p>Neville swallowed, and said it. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Wha?" said Harry, sounding totally confused.</p>
<p>"I wasn't grateful when you helped me -"</p>
<p>"Every single thing you said before was completely right," said
the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"No," Neville said, "it wasn't."</p>
<p>They simultaneously gave brief sad smiles, each condescending to
the other.</p>
<p>"I know this wasn't real," said Neville, "I know I couldn't have
done anything if you hadn't been here, but thanks for letting me
pretend."</p>
<p>"Give me a break," said Harry.</p>
<p>Harry had turned from Neville, and was staring out the window at
the gloomy clouds.</p>
<p>A completely ridiculous thought came to Neville. "Are you
feeling guilty because you can't get Lesath's parents out of
Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry.</p>
<p>A few seconds went by.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry.</p>
<p>"You're silly," said Neville.</p>
<p>"I am aware of this," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Do you have to do literally <i>anything</i> anyone asks
you?"</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived turned back and looked at Neville again.
"<i>Do?</i> No. Feel guilty about not doing? Yes."</p>
<p>Neville was having trouble finding words. "Once the Dark Lord
died, Bellatrix Black was literally the most evil person in the
entire world and that was <i>before</i> she went to Azkaban. She
tortured my mother and father into insanity because she wanted to
find out what happened to the Dark Lord -"</p>
<p>"I know," Harry said quietly. "I get that, but -"</p>
<p>"No! You <i>don't!</i> She had a <i>reason</i> for doing that,
and my parents were both Aurors! It's not even <i>close</i> to the
worst thing she's ever done!" Neville's voice was shaking.</p>
<p>"Even so," said the Boy-Who-Lived, his eyes distant as they
stared off into somewhere else, some other place that Neville
couldn't imagine. "There might be some incredibly clever solution
that makes it possible to save everyone and let them all live
happily ever after, and if only I was smart enough I would have
thought of it by now -"</p>
<p>"You have problems," said Neville. "You think you ought to be
what Lesath Lestrange thinks you are."</p>
<p>"Yeah," said the Boy-Who-Lived, "that pretty much nails it.
Every time someone cries out in prayer and I can't answer, I feel
guilty about not being God."</p>
<p>Neville didn't quite understand that, but... "That doesn't sound
good."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "I understand that I have a problem, and I know
what I need to do to solve it, all right? I'm working on it."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry watched Neville leave.</p>
<p>Of course Harry hadn't said what the solution was.</p>
<p>The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God.</p>
<p>Neville's footsteps moved off, and soon could no longer be
heard.</p>
<p>And then there was one.</p>
<p>"Ahem," said Severus Snape's voice from directly behind him.</p>
<p>Harry let out a small scream and instantly hated himself.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry turned around.</p>
<p>The tall greasy man in the spotted robes was leaning against the
wall in the same position Harry had occupied.</p>
<p>"A fine invisibility cloak, Potter," drawled the Potions Master.
"Much is explained."</p>
<p>Oh, bloody crap.</p>
<p>"And perhaps I have been in Dumbledore's company too long," said
Severus, "but I cannot help but wonder if that is <i>the</i> Cloak
of Invisibility."</p>
<p>Harry immediately turned into someone who'd never heard of the
Cloak of Invisibility and who was <i>exactly</i> as smart as Harry
thought Severus thought Harry was.</p>
<p>"Oh, possibly," said Harry. "I trust you realize the
implications, if it is?"</p>
<p>Severus's voice was condescending. "You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you, Potter? A rather clumsy try at fishing."</p>
<p>(Professor Quirrell had remarked over their lunch that Harry
really needed to conceal his state of mind better than putting on a
blank face when someone discussed a dangerous topic, and had
explained about one-level deceptions, two-level deceptions, and so
on. So either Severus <i>was</i> in fact modeling Harry as a
one-level player, which made Severus himself two-level, and Harry's
three-level move had been successful; or Severus was a four-level
player and wanted Harry to <i>think</i> the deception had been
successful. Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell what level
<i>he</i> played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had
responded, <i>One level higher than you</i>.)</p>
<p>"So you were watching this whole time," said Harry.
"Disillusionment, I think it's called."</p>
<p>A thin smile. "It would have been foolish of me to take the
slightest risk that you came to harm."</p>
<p>"And you wanted to see the results of your test firsthand," said
Harry. "So. Am I like my father?"</p>
<p>A strange sad expression came over the man, one that looked
foreign to his face. "I should sooner say, Harry Potter, that you
resemble -"</p>
<p>Severus stopped short.</p>
<p>He stared at Harry.</p>
<p>"Lestrange called you a son of a mudblood," Severus said slowly.
"It didn't seem to bother you much."</p>
<p>Harry furrowed his eyebrows. "Not under those circumstances,
no."</p>
<p>"You'd just helped him," Severus said. His eyes were intent on
Harry. "And he threw it back in your face. Surely that isn't
something you'd just forgive?"</p>
<p>"He'd just been through a pretty harrowing experience," Harry
said. "And I don't think being rescued by first-years helped his
pride much, either."</p>
<p>"I suppose it was easy enough to forgive," Severus said, and his
voice was odd, "since Lestrange means nothing to you. Just some
strange Slytherin. If it was a friend, perhaps, you would have felt
far more injured by what he said."</p>
<p>"If he were a friend," Harry said, "all the more reason to
forgive him."</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Harry felt, and he couldn't have said
why or from where, that the air was filling up with a dreadful
tension, like water rising, and rising, and rising.</p>
<p>Then Severus smiled, looking suddenly relaxed once more, and all
the tension vanished.</p>
<p>"You are a very forgiving person," Severus said, still smiling.
"I suppose your stepfather, Michael Verres-Evans, was the one who
taught it to you."</p>
<p>"More like Dad's science fiction and fantasy collection," said
Harry. "Sort of my fifth parent, really. I've lived the lives of
all the characters in all my books, and all their mighty wisdom
thunders in my head. Somewhere in there was someone like Lesath, I
expect, though I couldn't say who. It wasn't hard to put myself in
his shoes. And it was my books that told me what to do about it,
too. The good guys forgive."</p>
<p>Severus gave a light, amused laugh. "I'm afraid I wouldn't know
much about what good people do."</p>
<p>Harry looked at him. That was kind of sad, actually. "I'll lend
you some novels with good people in them, if you like."</p>
<p>"I should like to ask your advice about something," Severus
said, his voice casual. "I know of another fifth-year Slytherin who
was being bullied by Gryffindors. He was wooing a beautiful
Muggleborn girl, who came across him being bullied, and tried to
rescue him. And he called her a mudblood, and that was the end for
them. He apologized, many times, but she never forgave him. Have
you any thoughts for what he could have said or done, to win from
her the forgiveness you gave Lestrange?"</p>
<p>"Erm," Harry said, "based on only that information, I'm not sure
<i>he</i> was the main one who had a problem. I'd have told him not
to date someone that incapable of forgiveness. Suppose they'd
gotten married, can you imagine life in that household?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Oh, but she <i>could</i> forgive," Severus said with amusement
in his voice. "Why, afterward, she went off and became the
girlfriend of the bully. Tell me, why would she forgive the bully,
and not the bullied?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "At a wild guess, because the bully had hurt
someone <i>else</i> very badly, and the bullied had hurt <i>her</i>
just a little, and to her that just felt far more unforgivable
somehow. Or, not to put too fine a point on it, was the bully
handsome? Or for that matter, rich?"</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"Yes to both," said Severus.</p>
<p>"And there you have it," said Harry. "Not that I've ever been
through high school myself, but my books give me to understand that
there's a certain kind of teenage girl who'll be outraged by a
single insult if the boy is plain or poor, yet who can somehow find
room in her heart to forgive a rich and handsome boy his bullying.
She was shallow, in other words. Tell whoever it was that she
wasn't worthy of him and he needs to get over it and move on and
next time date girls who are deep instead of pretty."</p>
<p>Severus stared at Harry in silence, his eyes glittering. The
smile had faded, and though Severus's face twitched, it did not
return.</p>
<p>Harry was starting to feel a bit nervous. "Um, not that I've got
any experience in the area myself, obviously, but I think that's
what a wise adviser from my books would say."</p>
<p>There was more silence and more glittering.</p>
<p>It was probably a good time to change the subject.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said. "Did I pass your test, whatever it was?"</p>
<p>"I think," Severus said, "that there should be no more
conversations between us, Potter, and you would be exceedingly wise
never to speak of this one."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Would you mind telling me what I did wrong?"</p>
<p>"You offended me," said Severus. "And I no longer trust your
cunning."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Severus, taken rather aback.</p>
<p>"But you have given me well-meant advice," said Severus Snape,
"and so I will give you true advice in return." His voice was
almost perfectly steady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly
horizontal, despite the massive weight hanging from its middle, by
a million tons of tension pulling at either end. "You almost died
today, Potter. In the future, never share your wisdom with anyone
unless you know exactly what you are both talking about."</p>
<p>Harry's mind finally made the connection.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> were that -"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth snapped shut as the <i>almost died</i> part sank
in, two seconds too late.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Severus, "I was."</p>
<p>And the terrible tension flooded back into the room like water
pressurized at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't breathe.</p>
<p><i>Lose. Now.</i></p>
<p>"I didn't know," Harry whispered. "I'm s-"</p>
<p>"No," said Severus. Just that one word.</p>
<p>Harry stood there in silence, his mind frantically searching for
options. Severus stood between him and the window, which was a real
pity, because a fall from that height wouldn't kill a wizard.</p>
<p>"Your books betrayed you, Potter," said Severus, still in that
voice stretched tight by a million tons of pull. "They did not tell
you the one thing you needed to know. You cannot learn from stories
what it is like to lose the one you love. That is something you
could never understand without feeling it yourself."</p>
<p>"My father," Harry whispered. It was his best guess, the one
thing that might save him. "My father tried to protect you from the
bullies."</p>
<p>A ghastly smile stretched across Severus's face, and the man
moved toward Harry.</p>
<p>And past him.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Potter," said Severus, not looking back on his way
out. "We shall have little to say to each other from today on."</p>
<p>And at the corner, the man stopped, and without turning, spoke
one final time.</p>
<p>"Your father was the bully," said Severus Snape, "and what your
mother saw in him was something I never did understand until this
day."</p>
<p>He left.</p>
<p>Harry turned and walked toward the window. His shaking hands
went onto the ledge.</p>
<p><i>Never give anyone wise advice unless you know exactly what
you're both talking about. Got it.</i></p>
<p>Harry stared out at the clouds and the light drizzle for a
while. The window looked out on the east grounds, and it was
afternoon, so if the sun was visible through the clouds at all,
Harry couldn't see it.</p>
<p>His hands had stopped shaking, but there was a tight feeling in
Harry's chest, like it was being compressed by metal bands.</p>
<p>So his father had been a bully.</p>
<p>And his mother had been shallow.</p>
<p>Maybe they'd grown up later. Good people like Professor
McGonagall did seem to think the world of them, and it might not be
<i>only</i> because they were heroic martyrs.</p>
<p>Of course, that was scant consolation when you were eleven and
about to turn into a teenager, and wondering what sort of teenager
you might become.</p>
<p>So very terrible.</p>
<p>So very sad.</p>
<p>Such an awful life Harry led.</p>
<p>Learning that his genetic parents hadn't been perfect, why, he
ought to spend awhile moping about that, feeling sorry for
himself.</p>
<p>Maybe he could complain to Lesath Lestrange.</p>
<p>Harry had read about Dementors. Cold and darkness surrounded
them, and fear, they sucked away all your happy thoughts and in
that absence all your worst memories rose to the surface.</p>
<p>He could imagine himself in Lesath's shoes, knowing that his
parents were in Azkaban for life, that place from which no one had
ever escaped.</p>
<p>And Lesath would be imagining himself in his mother's place, in
the cold and the darkness and the fear, alone with all of her worst
memories, even in her dreams, every second of every day.</p>
<p>For an instant Harry imagined his own Mum and Dad in Azkaban
with the Dementors sucking out their life, draining away the happy
memories of their love for him. Just for an instant, before his
imagination blew a fuse and called an emergency shutdown and told
him never to imagine that again.</p>
<p>Was it right to do that to anyone, even the second most evil
person in the world?</p>
<p><i>No,</i> said the wisdom of Harry's books, <i>not if there's
any other way, any other way at all.</i></p>
<p>And unless the wizarding justice system was as perfect as their
prisons - and that sounded rather improbable, all things considered
- somewhere in Azkaban was a person who was entirely innocent, and
probably more than one.</p>
<p>There was a burning sensation in Harry's throat, and moisture
gathering in his eyes, and he wanted to teleport all of Azkaban's
prisoners to safety and call down fire from the sky and blast that
terrible place down to bedrock. But he couldn't, because he wasn't
God.</p>
<p>And Harry remembered what Professor Quirrell had said beneath
the starlight: <i>Sometimes, when this flawed world seems unusually
hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far
away, where I should have been... But the stars are so very, very
far away... And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a
long, long time.</i><i><br /></i></p>
<p>Right now this flawed world seemed unusually hateful.</p>
<p>And Harry couldn't understand Professor Quirrell's words, it
might have been an alien that had spoken, or an Artificial
Intelligence, something built along such different lines from Harry
that his brain couldn't be forced to operate in that mode.</p>
<p>You couldn't leave your home planet while it still contained a
place like Azkaban.</p>
<p>You had to stay and fight.</p>

<p>Whatever can go Rowling will go Rowling.</p>
<p>This should <i>again</i> go <i>without saying,</i> but views
expressed by Severus Snape are not necessarily those of the
author.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Okay," Harry said, swallowing. "Okay, Hermione, it's enough,
you can stop."</p>
<p>The white sugar pill in front of Hermione still hadn't changed
shape or color at all, even though she was concentrating harder
than Harry had ever seen, her eyes squeezed shut, beads of sweat on
her forehead, hand trembling as it gripped the wand -</p>
<p>"Hermione, <i>stop!</i> It's not going to work, Hermione, I
don't think we can make things that don't exist yet!"</p>
<p>Slowly, Hermione's hand relaxed its grasp on the wand.</p>
<p>"I thought I felt it," she said in a bare whisper. "I thought I
felt it start to Transfigure, just for a second."</p>
<p>There was a lump in Harry's throat. "You were probably imagining
it. Hoping too hard."</p>
<p>"I probably was," she said. She looked like she wanted to
cry.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry took his mechanical pencil in his hand, and
reached over to the sheet of paper with all the items crossed out,
and drew a line through the item that said 'ALZHEIMER'S CURE'.</p>
<p>They couldn't have fed anyone a Transfigured pill. But
Transfiguration, at least the kind they could do, didn't enchant
the targets - it wouldn't Transfigure a regular broomstick into a
flying one. So if Hermione had been able to make a pill at all, it
would have been a <i>nonmagical</i> pill, one that worked for
ordinary material reasons. They could have secretly made pills for
a Muggle science lab, let them <i>study</i> the pills and try to
reverse-engineer them before the Transfiguration wore off... no one
in either world would need to know that magic had been involved, it
would just be another scientific breakthrough...</p>
<p>It hadn't been the sort of thing a wizard would think of,
either. They didn't respect mere <i>patterns of atoms</i> that
much, they didn't think of unenchanted <i>material</i> things as
objects of power. If it wasn't magical, it wasn't interesting.</p>
<p>Earlier, Harry had <i>very</i> secretly - he hadn't even told
Hermione - tried to Transfigure nanotechnology a la Eric Drexler.
(He'd tried to produce a desktop nanofactory, of course, not tiny
self-replicating assemblers, Harry wasn't insane.) It would have
been godhood in a single shot if it'd worked.</p>
<p>"That was it for today, right?" said Hermione. She was slumped
back in her chair, leaning her head against the back; and her face
showed her tiredness, which was very unusual for Hermione. She
liked to pretend she was limitless, at least when Harry was
around.</p>
<p>"One more," Harry said cautiously, "but that one's small, plus
it might actually work. I saved it for last because I was hoping we
could end on an up note. It's real stuff, not like phasers. They've
already made it in the laboratory, not like the Alzheimer's cure.
And it's a generic substance, not specific like the lost books you
tried to Transfigure copies of. I made a diagram of the molecular
structure to show you. We just want to make it <i>longer</i> than
it's ever been made before, and with all the tubes aligned, and the
endpoints embedded in diamond." Harry produced a sheet of graph
paper.</p>
<p>Hermione sat back up, took it, and studied it, frowning. "These
are <i>all</i> carbon atoms? And Harry, what's the name? I can't
Transfigure it if I don't know what it's called."</p>
<p>Harry made a disgusted face. He was still having trouble getting
used to that sort of thing, it shouldn't matter what something was
<i>named</i> if you knew what it <i>was.</i> "They're called
buckytubes, or carbon nanotubes. It's a kind of fullerene that was
discovered just this year. It's about a hundred times stronger than
steel and a sixth of the weight."</p>
<p>Hermione looked up from the graph paper, her face surprised.
"That's <i>real?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said, "just hard to make the Muggle way. If we
could get enough of the stuff, we could use it to build a space
elevator all the way up to geosynchronous orbit or higher, and in
terms of delta-v that's halfway to anywhere in the Solar System.
Plus we could throw out solar power satellites like confetti."</p>
<p>Hermione was frowning again. "Is this stuff <i>safe?</i>"</p>
<p>"I don't see why it wouldn't be," Harry said. "A buckytube is
just a graphite sheet wrapped into a circular tube, basically, and
graphite is the same stuff used in pencils -"</p>
<p>"I <i>know</i> what graphite is, Harry," Hermione said. She
brushed her hair back absentmindedly, her eyebrows furrowed as she
stared at the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Harry reached into a pocket of his robes, and produced a white
thread tied to two small gray plastic rings at either end. He'd
added drops of superglue where the thread met either ring, to make
it all a single object that could be Transfigured as a whole.
Cyanoacrylate, if Harry remembered correctly, worked by covalent
bonds, and that was as close to being a "solid object" as you ever
got in a world ultimately composed of tiny individual atoms. "When
you're ready," Harry said, "try to Transfigure this into a set of
aligned buckytube fibers embedded in two solid diamond rings."</p>
<p>"All right..." Hermione said slowly. "Harry, I feel like I just
missed something."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. <i>Maybe you're just tired.</i> He
knew better than to say it out loud, though.</p>
<p>Hermione laid her wand against one plastic ring, and stared for
a while.</p>
<p>Two small circles of glittering diamond lay on the table,
connected by a long black thread.</p>
<p>"It changed," said Hermione. She sounded like she was trying to
be enthusiastic but had run out of energy. "Now what?"</p>
<p>Harry felt a bit deflated by his research partner's lack of
passion, but did his best not to show it; maybe the same process
would work in reverse to cheer her up. "Now I test it to see if it
holds weight."</p>
<p>There was an A-frame Harry had rigged up to do an earlier
experiment with diamond rods - you could make solid diamond objects
easily, using Transfiguration, they just wouldn't last. The earlier
experiment had measured whether Transfiguring a long diamond rod
into a shorter diamond rod would allow it to lift a suspended heavy
weight as it contracted, i.e., could you Transfigure against
tension, which you in fact could.</p>
<p>Harry carefully looped one circle of glittering diamond over the
thick metal hook at the top of the rig, then attached a thick metal
hanger to the bottom ring, and then started attaching weights to
the hanger.</p>
<p>(Harry had asked the Weasley twins to Transfigure the apparatus
for him, and the Weasley twins had given him an incredulous look,
like they couldn't figure out what sort of prank he could
<i>possibly</i> want that for, but they hadn't asked any questions.
And their Transfigurations, according to them, lasted for around
three hours, so Harry and Hermione still had a while left.)</p>
<p>"One hundred kilograms," Harry said about a minute later. "I
don't think a steel thread this thin would hold that. It should go
up much higher, but that's all the weight I've got."</p>
<p>There was a further silence.</p>
<p>Harry straightened up, and went back to their table, and sat
down in his chair, and ceremoniously made a check mark next to
'Buckytubes'. "There," Harry said. "<i>That</i> one worked."</p>
<p>"But it's not really <i>useful</i>, Harry, is it?" Hermione said
from where she was sitting with her head resting in her hands. "I
mean, even if we gave it to a scientist they couldn't learn how to
make lots of buckytubes from studying ours."</p>
<p>"They might be able to learn <i>something,</i>" Harry said.
"Hermione, <i>look</i> at it, that little tiny thread holding up
all that weight, we just made something that no Muggle laboratory
could make -"</p>
<p>"But any other witch could make it," Hermione said. Her
exhaustion was coming into her voice, now. "Harry, I don't think
this is working out."</p>
<p>"You mean our relationship?" Harry said. "Great! Let's break
up."</p>
<p>That got a slight grin out of her. "I mean our research."</p>
<p>"Oh, Hermione, how <i>could</i> you?"</p>
<p>"You're sweet when you're mean," she said. "But Harry, this is
nuts, I'm twelve, you're eleven, it's <i>silly</i> to think we're
going to discover anything that no one's ever figured out
before."</p>
<p>"Are you really saying we should give up on unraveling the
secrets of magic after trying for less than one <i>month?</i>"
Harry said, trying to put a note of challenge into his voice.
Honestly he was feeling some of the same fatigue as Hermione. None
of the <i>good</i> ideas ever worked. He'd made just one discovery
worth mentioning, the Mendelian pattern, and he couldn't tell
Hermione about it without breaking his promise to Draco.</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said. Her young face was looking very serious and
adult. "I'm saying right now we should be <i>studying</i> all the
magic that wizards already know, so we can do this sort of thing
after we graduate from Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "Hermione, I hate to put it this way, but
imagine we'd decided to hold off on research until later, and the
first thing we tried after we graduated was Transfiguring an
Alzheimer's cure, and it <i>worked.</i> We'd feel... I don't think
the word <i>stupid</i> would adequately describe how we'd feel.
What if there's something else like that and it does work?"</p>
<p>"That's not <i>fair,</i> Harry!" Hermione said. Her voice was
trembling like she was on the verge of breaking out crying. "You
can't <i>put</i> that on people! It's not our <i>job</i> to do that
sort of thing, we're <i>kids!</i>"</p>
<p>For a moment Harry wondered what would happen if someone told
Hermione she had to fight an immortal Dark Lord, if she would turn
into one of the whiny self-pitying heroes that Harry could never
stand reading about in his books.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Hermione said. Her voice shook. "I don't want to keep
doing this. I don't believe children can do things that grownups
can't, that's only in stories."</p>
<p>There was silence in the classroom.</p>
<p>Hermione started to look a little scared, and Harry knew that
his own expression had gotten colder.</p>
<p>It might not have hurt so much if the same thought hadn't
already come to Harry - that, while thirty might be old for a
scientific revolutionary and twenty about right, while there were
people who got doctorates when they were seventeen and
fourteen-year-old heirs who'd been great kings or generals, there
wasn't really anyone who'd made the history books at eleven.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "Figure out how to do something a
grownup can't. Is that your challenge?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean it like that," Hermione said, her voice coming
out in a frightened whisper.</p>
<p>With an effort, Harry wrenched his gaze away from Hermione. "I'm
not angry at <i>you</i>," Harry said. His voice was cold, despite
his best efforts. "I'm angry at, I don't know, everything. But I'm
not willing to lose, Hermione. Losing isn't always the right thing
to do. I'll figure out how to do something a grown wizard can't do,
and then I'll get back to you. How's that?"</p>
<p>There was more silence.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione, her voice wavering a little. She pushed
herself up out of her chair, and went over to the door of the
abandoned classroom they'd been working in. Her hand went onto the
doorknob. "We're still friends, right? And if you can't figure out
anything -"</p>
<p>Her voice halted.</p>
<p>"Then we'll study together," Harry said. His voice was even
colder now.</p>
<p>"Um, bye for now, then," Hermione said, and she quickly went out
of the room and shut the door behind her.</p>
<p>Sometimes Harry hated having a dark side, even when he was
inside it.</p>
<p>And the part of him that had thought exactly the same thing as
Hermione, that no, children <i>couldn't</i> do what grownups
couldn't, was saying all the things that Hermione had been too
frightened to say, like, <i>That's one hell of a difficult
challenge you just grabbed for yourself</i> and <i>boy are you
going to end up with egg on your face this time</i> and <i>at least
this way you'll know you've failed.</i></p>
<p>And the part of him that didn't enjoy losing replied, in a very
cold voice, <i>Fine, you can shut up and watch.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was almost lunchtime, and Harry didn't care. He hadn't even
bothered grabbing a snack bar from his pouch. His stomach could
stand a little starving.</p>
<p>The wizarding world was tiny, they didn't think like scientists,
they didn't know science, they didn't question what they'd grown up
with, they hadn't put protective shells on their time machines,
they played Quidditch, all of magical Britain was smaller than a
small Muggle city, the greatest wizarding school only educated up
to the age of seventeen, <i>silly</i> wasn't challenging that at
eleven, <i>silly</i> was <i>assuming</i> wizards knew what they
were doing and had already exhausted all the low-hanging fruit a
scientific polymath would see.</p>
<p>Step One had been to make a list of every magical constraint
Harry could remember, all the things you supposedly couldn't
do.</p>
<p>Step Two, mark the constraints that seemed to make the
<i>least</i> sense from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>Step Three, prioritize constraints that a wizard would be
unlikely to question if they <i>didn't</i> know science.</p>
<p>Step Four, come up with avenues for attacking them.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione still felt a little shaky as she sat down next to Mandy
at the Ravenclaw table. Hermione's lunch had two fruits (tomato
slices and peeled tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots,
and more carrots), one meat (fried Diricawl drumsticks whose
unhealthy coating she would carefully remove), and one little piece
of chocolate cake that she would earn by eating the other
parts.</p>
<p>It hadn't been as bad as Potions class, sometimes she still had
<i>nightmares</i> about that. But this time <i>she</i> had made it
happen and <i>she'd felt like its target.</i> Just for a moment,
before the terrible cold darkness looked away and said it wasn't
angry with her, because it hadn't wanted to scare her.</p>
<p>And she still had that feeling like she'd missed something
earlier, something really important.</p>
<p>But they hadn't violated any of the rules of Transfiguration...
had they? They hadn't made any liquids, any gases, they hadn't
taken orders from the Defense Professor...</p>
<p>The <i>pill!</i> That had been something to be eaten!</p>
<p>...well, no, nobody would just eat a pill lying around, it
hadn't <i>worked</i> actually, they could have just <i>Finite
Incantatemed</i> it if it had, but she would still have to tell
Harry about that and make sure they didn't mention it in front of
Professor McGonagall, in case they were never allowed to study
Transfiguration again...</p>
<p>Hermione was starting to get a really sick feeling in her
stomach. She pushed back her plate from the table, she couldn't eat
lunch like this.</p>
<p>And she closed her eyes and began to mentally recite the rules
of Transfiguration.</p>
<p><i>"I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or
gas."</i></p>
<p><i>"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or
anything else that goes inside a human body."</i></p>
<p>No, they really <i>shouldn't</i> have tried to Transfigure the
pill, or they should've at least <i>realized...</i> she'd been so
caught up in Harry's brilliant idea that she hadn't
<i>thought...</i></p>
<p>The sick feeling in Hermione's stomach was getting worse. There
was a feeling in her mind of something hovering just on the edge of
recognition, a perception about to invert itself, a young woman
about to become a crone, a vase about to become two faces...</p>
<p>And she went on remembering the rules of Transfiguration.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry's knuckles had gone white on his wand by the time he
stopped trying to Transfigure the air in front of his wand into a
paperclip. It wouldn't have been safe to Transfigure the paperclip
into gas, of course, but Harry didn't see any reason why it would
be unsafe the other way around. It just wasn't supposed to be
<i>possible</i>. But why not? Air was as real a substance as
anything else...</p>
<p>Well, maybe that limitation <i>did</i> make sense. Air was
disorganized, all the molecules constantly changing their relation
to each other. Maybe you couldn't impose a new form on substance
unless the substance was staying still long enough for you to
master it, even though the atoms in solids were also constantly
vibrating all the time...</p>
<p>The more Harry failed, the colder he felt, the clearer
everything seemed to become.</p>
<p>All right. Next on the list.</p>
<p>You could only Transfigure whole objects as wholes. You couldn't
Transfigure <i>half</i> a match into a needle, you had to
Transfigure the <i>whole thing.</i> Back when Harry had been
trapped in that classroom by Draco, it had been the reason he
couldn't just Transfigure a thin cylindrical cross-section of the
walls into sponge, and punch out a chunk of stone large enough for
him to fit through the hole. He would have needed to impose a new
form on the whole wall, and maybe a whole section of Hogwarts, just
in order to change that little cross-section.</p>
<p>And that was <i>ridiculous</i>.</p>
<p><i>Things were made of atoms.</i> Lots of little tiny dots.
There <i>was</i> no contiguity, there <i>was</i> no solidity, just
electromagnetic forces holding the little dots related to each
other...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Mandy Brocklehurst paused with her fork on her way to her mouth.
"Huh," she said to Su Li, sitting across from the now-empty space
beside her, "what got into Hermione?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry wanted to kill his eraser.</p>
<p>He'd been trying to change a single spot on the pink rectangle
into steel, apart from the rest of the rubber, and the eraser
wasn't cooperating.</p>
<p>It <i>had</i> to be a conceptual limitation, not a real one.
<i>Had</i> to be.</p>
<p><i>Things were made of atoms,</i> and every atom was a tiny
separate thing. Atoms were held together by a quantum mist of
shared electrons, for covalent bonds, or sometimes just magnetism
at close ranges, for ionic bonds or van der Waals forces.</p>
<p>If it came down to that, the protons and neutrons inside the
nuclei were tiny separate things. The quarks inside the protons and
neutrons were tiny separate things! There simply <i>wasn't</i>
anything in reality, the world-out-there, that corresponded to
people's conceit of solid objects. It was all just little dots.</p>
<p>And free Transfiguration was all in the mind to begin with,
wasn't it? No words, no gestures. Only the pure concept of form,
kept strictly separate from substance, imposed on the substance,
conceived of apart from its form. That and the wand and whatever
made you a wizard.</p>
<p>The wizards couldn't transform parts of things, could only
transform what their minds perceived as wholes, because they didn't
<i>know in their bones</i> that it was all just atoms deep
down.</p>
<p>Harry had focused on that knowledge as hard as he could, the
<i>true fact</i> that the eraser was just a collection of atoms,
everything was just collections of atoms, and the atoms of the
little patch he was trying to Transfigure formed <i>just as
valid</i> a collection as any other collection he cared to think
about.</p>
<p>And Harry still hadn't been able to change that single part of
the eraser, the Transfiguration wasn't going anywhere.</p>
<p><i>This. Was. Ridiculous.</i></p>
<p>Harry's knuckles were whitening on his wand again. He was
<i>sick</i> of getting experimental results that <i>didn't make
sense.</i></p>
<p>Maybe the fact that <i>some</i> part of his mind was still
thinking in terms of objects was stopping the Transfiguration from
going through. He had thought of a collection of atoms that was an
<i>eraser.</i> He had thought of a collection that was a <i>little
patch.</i></p>
<p>Time to kick it up a notch.</p>
<p>Harry pressed his wand harder against that tiny section of
eraser, and tried to see through the illusion that nonscientists
thought was reality, the world of desks and chairs, air and erasers
and people.</p>
<p>When you walked through a park, the immersive world that
surrounded you was something that existed inside your own brain as
a pattern of neurons firing. The sensation of a bright blue sky
wasn't something high above you, it was something in your visual
cortex, and your visual cortex was in the back of your brain. All
the sensations of that bright world were really happening in that
quiet cave of bone you called your skull, the place where
<i>you</i> lived and never, ever left. If you really wanted to say
hello to someone, to the <i>actual person,</i> you wouldn't shake
their hand, you'd knock gently on their skull and say "How are you
doing in there?" That was what people were, that was where they
really lived. And the <i>picture</i> of the park that you thought
you were <i>walking through</i> was something that was visualized
inside your brain as it processed the signals sent down from your
eyes and retina.</p>
<p>It wasn't a <i>lie</i> like the Buddhists thought, there wasn't
something terribly mystical and unexpected behind the veil of Maya,
what lay beyond the illusion of the park was just the <i>actual
park</i>, but it was all still <i>illusion</i>.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sitting inside the classroom.</p>
<p>He wasn't looking at the eraser.</p>
<p>Harry was inside Harry's skull.</p>
<p>He was experiencing a processed picture his brain had decoded
from the signals sent down by his retina.</p>
<p>The real eraser was somewhere else, somewhere that wasn't the
picture.</p>
<p>And the real eraser wasn't like the picture Harry's brain had of
it. The idea of the eraser as a <i>solid object</i> was something
that existed only inside his own brain, inside the parietal cortex
that processed his sense of shape and space. The real eraser was a
collection of atoms held together by electromagnetic forces and
shared covalent electrons, while nearby, air molecules bounced off
each other and bounced off the eraser-molecules.</p>
<p>The real eraser was far away, and Harry, inside his skull, could
never quite touch it, could only imagine ideas about it. But <i>his
wand had the power,</i> it could change things out there in
<i>reality</i>, it was only Harry's own preconceptions that were
<i>limiting</i> it. Somewhere beyond the veil of Maya, the
<i>truth</i> behind Harry's concept of "my wand" was touching the
collection of atoms that Harry's mind thought of as "a patch on the
eraser", and if that wand could change the collection of atoms that
Harry considered "the whole eraser", there was absolutely no reason
why it couldn't change the other collection too...</p>
<p>The Transfiguration still wasn't going through.</p>
<p>Harry's teeth clenched together, and he kicked it up
<i>another</i> notch.</p>
<p>The concept Harry's mind had of the eraser as a single object
was <i>obvious nonsense.</i></p>
<p>It was a map that didn't and <i>couldn't</i> match the
territory.</p>
<p>Human beings modeled the world using stratified levels of
organization, they had <i>separate thoughts</i> about how countries
worked, how people worked, how organs worked, how cells worked, how
molecules worked, how quarks worked.</p>
<p>When Harry's brain needed to think about the eraser, it would
think about the rules that governed erasers, like "erasers can get
rid of pencil-marks". Only if Harry's brain needed to predict what
would happen on the lower chemical level, only then would Harry's
brain start thinking - as though it were a separate fact - about
rubber molecules.</p>
<p>But that was all in the <i>mind.</i></p>
<p>Harry's mind might have separate <i>beliefs</i> about rules that
governed erasers, but there was no <i>separate law of physics</i>
that governed erasers.</p>
<p>Harry's mind modeled reality using multiple levels of
organization, with different beliefs about each level. But that was
all in the <i>map,</i> the true territory wasn't like that,
<i>reality itself</i> had only a <i>single</i> level of
organization, the quarks, it was a unified low-level process
obeying mathematically simple rules.</p>
<p>Or at least that was what Harry had believed before he'd found
out about magic, but the eraser wasn't magical.</p>
<p>And even if the eraser <i>had</i> been magical, the idea that
there could <i>really exist</i> a single solid eraser was
<i>impossible.</i> Things like erasers <i>couldn't</i> be basic
elements of reality, they were too big and complicated to be atoms,
they <i>had</i> to be made of parts<i>.</i> You couldn't have
things that were <i>fundamentally complicated</i>. The implicit
belief that Harry's brain had in the eraser as a single object
wasn't just <i>wrong,</i> it was a map-territory confusion, the
eraser only existed as a separate concept in Harry's multi-level
<i>model</i> of the world, not as a separate element of
single-level reality.</p>
<p>...the Transfiguration <i>still wasn't happening.</i></p>
<p>Harry was breathing heavily, failed Transfiguration was almost
as tiring as successful Transfiguration, but <i>damned</i> if he'd
give up now.</p>
<p>All right, screw this nineteenth-century garbage.</p>
<p>Reality wasn't atoms, it wasn't a set of tiny billiard balls
bopping around. That was just another lie. The notion of atoms as
little dots was just another convenient hallucination that people
clung to because they didn't want to confront the inhumanly alien
shape of the underlying reality. No wonder, then, that his attempts
to Transfigure based on that hadn't worked. If he wanted power, he
had to abandon his humanity, and force his thoughts to conform to
the true math of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>There <i>were no particles,</i> there were just <i>clouds of
amplitude</i> in a <i>multiparticle configuration space</i> and
what his brain fondly imagined to be an eraser was nothing except a
gigantic <i>factor</i> in a wavefunction that <i>happened to
factorize</i>, it didn't have a separate existence any more than
there was a particular solid factor of 3 hidden inside the number
6, if his wand was capable of <i>altering factors in an
approximately factorizable wavefunction</i> then it should damn
well be able to alter the slightly <i>smaller</i> factor that
Harry's brain visualized as a patch of material on the eraser -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione tore through the hallways, shoes pounding hard on the
stone, breath coming in pants, the shock of adrenaline still racing
through her blood.</p>
<p>Like a picture of a young woman turning into an old crone, like
the cup becoming two faces.</p>
<p>What had they been doing?</p>
<p><i>What had they been doing?</i></p>
<p>She came to the classroom and her fingers slipped on the
doorknob at first, too sweaty, she grabbed harder and the door
opened -</p>
<p>- in a single flash of perception she saw Harry staring at a
small pink rectangle on the table in front of him -</p>
<p>- as a few paces away the tiny black thread, almost invisible
from this distance, supported all that weight -</p>
<p><i>"Harry get out of the classroom!"</i></p>
<p>Pure shock crossed Harry's face, and he stood up so fast he
almost fell over, stopping only to grab the small pink rectangle
from the table, and he tore out of the door, she'd already stepped
aside, her wand was already in her hand coming up pointing at the
thread -</p>
<p>"<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>"</p>
<p>And Hermione slammed the door shut again, just as the gigantic
crash of a hundred kilograms of falling metal came from inside.</p>
<p>She was panting, gasping for air, she'd run all the way here
without stopping, she was soaked in sweat and her legs and thighs
burned like living flames, she couldn't have answered Harry's
questions for all the Galleons in the world.</p>
<p>Hermione blinked, and realized that she had started to fall, and
Harry had caught her, and was lowering her gently to sit on the
floor.</p>
<p>"...healthy..." she managed to whisper.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Harry, looking paler than she'd ever seen
him.</p>
<p>"...are you, feeling, healthy..."</p>
<p>Harry started looking even more frightened as the question sank
in. "I, I don't think I have any symptoms -"</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. "Good," she whispered.
"Catch, breath."</p>
<p>That took a while. Harry was still looking scared. That was good
too, maybe it would teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Hermione reached into the pouch Harry had bought her, whispered
"water" through her parched throat, took out the bottle and drank
in great huge gulps.</p>
<p>And then it was still a while before she could talk again.</p>
<p>"We broke the rules, Harry," she said in a hoarse voice. "We
broke the rules."</p>
<p>"I..." Harry swallowed. "I still don't see how, I've been
<i>thinking</i> but -"</p>
<p>"I asked if the Transfiguration was safe and <i>you answered
me!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"That's it?" Harry said.</p>
<p>She could have screamed.</p>
<p>"Harry, don't you get it?" she said. "It's made out of tiny
fibers, what if it <i>unraveled,</i> who <i>knows</i> what could go
wrong, <i>we didn't ask Professor McGonagall!</i> Don't you see
what we were doing? We were experimenting with Transfiguration. We
were <i>experimenting</i> with <i>Transfiguration!</i>"</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"Right..." Harry said slowly. "That's probably one of those
things they don't even bother telling you <i>not</i> to do because
it's too obvious. Don't test brilliant new ideas for
Transfiguration by yourselves in an unused classroom without
consulting any professors."</p>
<p>"You could have gotten us killed, Harry!" Hermione knew it
wasn't fair, she'd made the mistake too, but she still felt angry
at him, he always sounded so confident and that had dragged her
unthinkingly along in his wake. "We could have <i>spoiled Professor
McGonagall's perfect record!</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry, "let's not tell her about this, shall
we?"</p>
<p>"We have to stop," Hermione said. "We have to stop this or we're
going to get hurt. We're too young, Harry, we can't do this, not
yet."</p>
<p>A weak grin crossed Harry's face. "Um, you're sort of wrong
about that."</p>
<p>And he held out a small pink rectangle, a rubber eraser with a
bright metal patch on it.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at it, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Quantum mechanics wasn't enough," Harry said. "I had to go all
the way down to timeless physics before it took. Had to see the
wand as enforcing a <i>relation</i> between separate past and
future realities, instead of <i>changing</i> anything over time -
but I did it, Hermione, I saw past the illusion of objects, and I
bet there's not a single other wizard in the world who could have.
Even if some Muggleborn knew about timeless formulations of quantum
mechanics, it would just be a weird belief about strange distant
quantum stuff, they wouldn't <i>see</i> that it was <i>reality</i>,
accept that the world they knew was just a hallucination. I
Transfigured <i>part</i> of the eraser without changing the
<i>whole thing.</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione raised her wand again, pointed it at the eraser.</p>
<p>For a moment anger crossed Harry's face, but he didn't make any
move to stop her.</p>
<p>"<i>Finite Incantatem</i>," said Hermione. "Check with Professor
McGonagall before you try it again."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, though his face was still a bit tight.</p>
<p>"And we still have to stop," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"<i>Why?</i>" said Harry. "Don't you see what this
<i>means</i>, Hermione? Wizards <i>don't</i> know everything!
There's too few of them, even fewer who know any science, they
haven't exhausted the low-hanging fruit -"</p>
<p>"It's not <i>safe</i>," Hermione said. "If we <i>can</i> find
out new things it's even <i>less</i> safe! We're <i>too young!</i>
We made one big mistake already, next time we could just
<i>die!</i>"</p>
<p>Then Hermione flinched.</p>
<p>Harry looked away from her, and started taking slow, deep
breaths.</p>
<p>"Please don't try to do it alone, Harry," Hermione said, her
voice trembling. "Please."</p>
<p><i>Please don't make me have to decide whether to tell Professor
Flitwick.</i></p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"So you want us to study," Harry said. She could tell he was
trying to keep the anger out of his voice. "Just study."</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't sure if she should say anything, but... "Like
you studied, um, timeless physics, right?"</p>
<p>Harry looked back at her.</p>
<p>"That thing you did," Hermione said, her voice tentative, "it
wasn't because of <i>our</i> experiments, right? You could do it
because you'd read lots of books."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again. There was a
frustrated look on his face.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "How about this. We study, and if I
think of anything that seems <i>really</i> worth trying, we'll try
it after I ask a professor."</p>
<p>"Okay," Hermione said. She didn't fall over with relief, but
only because she was already sitting down.</p>
<p>"Shall we get lunch?" Harry said cautiously.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, this
time.</p>
<p>She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing
as her body screamed at her -</p>
<p>Harry pointed his wand at her and said "<i>Wingardium
Leviosa.</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione blinked as the huge weight on her legs diminished to
something bearable.</p>
<p>A smile quirked across Harry's face. "You can <i>lift</i>
something without being able to Hover it completely," he said.
"Remember that experiment?"</p>
<p>Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought
to still be angry.</p>
<p>And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling
remarkably and wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully
kept his wand trained on her.</p>
<p>He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the
thought that counted.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva looked at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly at her. "Did you understand
any of that?" the Headmaster said, sounding bemused.</p>
<p>It had been the most complete and utter gibberish that Minerva
could ever remember hearing. She was feeling a bit embarrassed
about having summoned the Headmaster to hear it, but she'd been
given explicit instructions.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Professor McGonagall said primly.</p>
<p>"So," Dumbledore said. The silver beard swung away from her, the
old wizard's twinkling gaze looked elsewhere once more. "You
suspect you might be able to do something that other wizards can't
do, something we think is impossible."</p>
<p>The three of them stood within the Headmaster's private
Transfiguration workroom, where the shining phoenix of Dumbledore's
Patronus had told her to bring Harry, moments after her own
Patronus had reached him. Light shone down through the skylights
and illuminated the great seven-pointed alchemical diagram drawn in
the center of the circular room, showing it to be a little dusty,
which saddened Minerva. Transfiguration research was one of
Dumbledore's great enjoyments, and she'd known how pressed for time
he'd been lately, but not that he was <i>this</i> pressed.</p>
<p>And now Harry Potter was going to waste even more of the
Headmaster's time. But she certainly couldn't blame <i>Harry</i>
for that. He'd done the proper thing in coming to her to say that
he'd had an idea for doing something in Transfiguration that was
currently believed to be impossible, and she herself had done
exactly what she'd been told to do: she'd ordered Harry to be quiet
and not discuss anything with her until she had consulted the
Headmaster and they'd finished moving to a secure location.</p>
<p>If Harry had started out by saying what <i>specifically</i> he
thought he could do, she wouldn't have bothered.</p>
<p>"Look, I know it's hard to explain," Harry said, sounding a
little embarrassed. "What it adds up to is that what you believe
conflicts with what scientists believe, in a case where I'd
genuinely expect scientists to know more than wizards."</p>
<p>Minerva would have sighed out loud, if Dumbledore hadn't seemed
to be taking the whole thing very seriously.</p>
<p>Harry's idea stemmed from simple ignorance, nothing more. If you
changed half of a metal ball into glass, the <i>whole ball</i> had
a different Form. To change the part <i>was</i> to change the
whole, and that meant removing the whole Form and replacing it with
a different one. What would it even <i>mean</i> to Transfigure only
half of a metal ball? That the metal ball <i>as a whole</i> had the
same Form as before, but <i>half</i> that ball now had a different
Form?</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "what you want to do
isn't just impossible, it's <i>illogical.</i> If you change half of
something, you <i>did</i> change the whole."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Dumbledore. "But Harry is the hero, so he may be
able to do things that are logically impossible."</p>
<p>Minerva would have rolled her eyes, if she hadn't gone numb a
long time ago.</p>
<p>"Supposing it <i>was</i> possible," said Dumbledore, "can you
think of any reason why the results would differ in any way from
ordinary Transfiguration?"</p>
<p>Minerva frowned. The fact that the concept was literally
unimaginable was presenting her with some difficulty, but she tried
to take it at face value. A Transfiguration imposed on only half of
a metal ball...</p>
<p>"Strange things happening at the interface?" said Minerva. "But
that should be no different than Transfiguring the object as a
whole, into a Form with two different parts..."</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded. "That is my own thought as well. And Harry,
if your theory is correct, it implies that what you want to do is
<i>exactly</i> like any other Transfiguration, only applied to a
part of the subject rather than the whole? No changes <i>at
all?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said firmly. "That's the whole point."</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at her again. "Minerva, can you think of any
reason whatsoever why that would be dangerous?"</p>
<p>"No," said Minerva, after she had finished searching through her
memory.</p>
<p>"Likewise myself," said the Headmaster. "All right, then, since
this ought to be exactly analogous to ordinary Transfiguration in
all respects, and since we cannot think of any reason whatsoever
why it would be dangerous, I think that the second degree of
caution will suffice."</p>
<p>Minerva was surprised, but she didn't object. Dumbledore was by
far her senior in Transfiguration, and he had tried literally
thousands of new Transfigurations without ever choosing a degree of
caution that was too low. He had used Transfiguration <i>in
combat</i> and he was <i>still alive.</i> If the Headmaster thought
the second degree was enough, it was enough.</p>
<p>That Harry was certainly going to fail was, of course,
completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>The two of them started setting up the wards and detection webs.
The most important web was the one that checked to make sure no
Transfigured material had entered the air. Harry would be enclosed
in a separate shell of force with its own air supply just to be
certain, only his wand allowed to leave the shield, and the
interface tight. They were inside Hogwarts so they couldn't
automatically Apparate out any material that showed signs of
spontaneous combustion, but they could launch it out a skylight
almost as fast, the windows all folded outward for exactly that
reason. Harry himself would go out a different skylight at the
first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>Harry watched them working, his face looking a little
frightened.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Professor McGonagall in the middle of her
running description, "this almost certainly won't be necessary, Mr.
Potter. If we <i>expected</i> anything to go wrong you would not be
allowed to try. It's just ordinary precautions for any
Transfiguration no one has ever tried before."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed and nodded.</p>
<p>And a few minutes later, Harry was strapped into the safety
chair and resting his wand against a metal ball - one that, based
on his current test scores, should have been too large for him to
Transfigure in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<p>And a few minutes after <i>that,</i> Minerva was leaning against
the wall, feeling faint.</p>
<p>There was a small patch of glass on the ball where Harry's wand
had rested.</p>
<p>Harry didn't say <i>I told you so,</i> but the smug look on his
sweating face said it for him.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was casting analytic Charms on the ball, looking more
and more intrigued by the moment. Thirty years had melted off his
face.</p>
<p>"Fascinating," said Dumbledore. "It's exactly as he claimed. He
simply Transfigured a part of the subject without Transfiguring the
whole. You say it's really just a conceptual limitation,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "but a deep one, just knowing it had to be a
conceptual limitation wasn't enough. I had to suppress the part of
my mind that was making the error and think instead about the
underlying reality that scientists figured out."</p>
<p>"Truly fascinating," Dumbledore said. "I take it that for any
other wizard to do the same would require months of study if they
could do it at all? And may I ask you to partially Transfigure some
other subjects?"</p>
<p>"Probably yes and of course," Harry said.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Minerva was feeling equally bewildered, but
considerably reassured about the safety issues.</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> the same, aside from being logically
impossible.</p>
<p>"I believe that's enough, Headmaster," Minerva said finally. "I
suspect partial Transfiguration is more tiring than the ordinary
sort."</p>
<p>"Getting less so with practice," said the exhausted and pale
boy, voice unsteady, "but yeah, you've got that right."</p>
<p>The process of extracting Harry from the wards took another
minute, and then Minerva escorted him to a much more comfortable
chair, and Dumbledore produced an ice-cream soda.</p>
<p>"<i>Congratulations</i>, Mr. Potter!" said Professor McGonagall,
and meant it. She would have bet almost anything against that
working.</p>
<p>"Congratulations indeed," said Dumbledore. "Even I did not make
any original discoveries in Transfiguration before the age of
fourteen. Not since the day of Dorotea Senjak has any genius
flowered so early."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Harry said, sounding a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless," Dumbledore said thoughtfully, "I think it would
be most wise to keep this happy event a secret, at least for now.
Harry, did you discuss your idea with any other person before you
spoke to Professor McGonagall?"</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "I don't want to turn anyone over to the
Inquisition, but I did tell one other student -"</p>
<p>The word almost exploded from Professor McGonagall's lips.
"<i>What?</i> You discussed a completely novel form of
Transfiguration with a <i>student</i> before consulting a
recognized authority? Do you have any idea how <i>irresponsible</i>
that was?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Harry. "I didn't realize."</p>
<p>The boy looked appropriately frightened, and Minerva felt
something inside her relax. At least Harry understood how foolish
he'd been.</p>
<p>"You must swear Miss Granger to secrecy," Dumbledore said
gravely. "And do not tell anyone else unless there is an extremely
good reason for it, and they too have sworn."</p>
<p>"Ah... why?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Minerva was wondering the same thing. Once again the Headmaster
was thinking too far ahead for her to keep up.</p>
<p>"Because you can do something that no one else will believe you
can do," Dumbledore said. "Something completely unexpected. It may
prove to be your critical advantage, Harry, and we must preserve
it. Please, trust me in this."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded, her firm face showing nothing of
her inner confusion. "Please do, Mr. Potter," she said.</p>
<p>"All right..." Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"Once we have finished examining your materials," Dumbledore
added, "you may practice partial Transfiguration, on glass to steel
and steel to glass <i>only</i>, with Miss Granger to act as your
spotter. Naturally, if either of you suspect any symptom of any
form of Transfiguration sickness, inform a professor at once."</p>
<p>Just before Harry left the workroom, with his hand on the
doorhandle, the boy turned back and said, "As long as we're here,
have either of you noticed anything different about Professor
Snape?"</p>
<p>"Different?" said the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Minerva didn't let her wry smile show on her face. Of course the
boy was apprehensive about the 'evil Potions Master', since he had
no way of knowing why Severus was to be trusted. It would have been
odd to say the least, explaining to Harry that Severus was still in
love with his mother.</p>
<p>"I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"Not that I have seen..." the Headmaster said slowly. "Why do
you ask?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. "I don't want to prejudice your own
observations by saying. Just keep an eye out, maybe?"</p>
<p>That sent a quiver of unease through Minerva in a way that no
outright accusation of Severus could have.</p>
<p>Harry bowed to both of them respectfully, and took his
leave.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Albus," Minerva said after the boy had gone, "how did you
<i>know</i> to take Harry seriously? I would have thought his idea
merely impossible!"</p>
<p>The old wizard's face turned grave. "The same reason it must be
kept secret, Minerva. The same reason I told you to come to me, if
Harry made any such claim. Because it is a power that Voldemort
knows not."</p>
<p>The words took a few seconds to sink in.</p>
<p>And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did
when she remembered.</p>
<p>It had started out as an ordinary job interview, Sybill
Trelawney applying for the position of Professor of Divination.</p>
<p><i>THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD
APPROACHES,<br />
BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,<br />
BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES,<br />
AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL,<br />
BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT,<br />
AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,<br />
FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME
WORLD.</i></p>
<p>Those dreadful words, spoken in that terrible booming voice,
didn't seem to fit something like partial Transfiguration.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, then," Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to
explain. "I confess I had been hoping for something that would help
in finding Voldemort's horcrux, wherever he may have hidden it.
But..." The old wizard shrugged. "Prophecies are tricky things,
Minerva, and it is best to take no chances. The smallest thing may
prove decisive if it remains unexpected."</p>
<p>"And what do you suppose he meant about <i>Severus?</i>" said
Minerva.</p>
<p>"There I have no idea," sighed Dumbledore. "Unless Harry is
making a move against Severus, and thought that an open question
might be taken seriously where a direct allegation would be
dismissed. And if that was indeed what happened, Harry correctly
reasoned that I would not trust that it was so. Let us simply keep
watch, without prejudice, as he asks."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, 1:</i></p>
<p>"Um, Hermione?" Harry said in a very small voice. "I think I owe
you a really, really, really big apology."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, 2:</i></p>
<p>Alissa Cornfoot's eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon
the Potions Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a
tiny bronze bean and saying something about screaming puddles of
human flesh. Ever since the start of this year she'd been having
trouble listening in Potions. She kept staring at their awful,
mean, greasy professor and fantasizing about special detentions.
There was probably something really <i>wrong</i> with her but she
just couldn't seem to stop doing it -</p>
<p>"Ow!" Alissa said then.</p>
<p>Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa's
forehead.</p>
<p>"Miss Cornfoot," said the Potions Master, his voice cutting,
"this is a delicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will
hurt your classmates, not just yourself. See me after class."</p>
<p>The last four words didn't help her any, but she tried harder,
and managed to get through the day without melting anyone.</p>
<p>After class, Alissa approached the desk. Part of her wanted to
stand there meekly with her face abashed and her hands clasped
penitently behind her back, just in case, but some quiet instinct
told her this might be a <i>bad idea</i>. So instead she just stood
there with her face neutral, in a posture that was very proper for
a young lady, and said, "Professor?"</p>
<p>"Miss Cornfoot," Snape said without looking up from the sheets
he was grading, "I do not return your affections, I begin to find
your stares disturbing, and you will restrain your eyes henceforth.
Is that quite clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed
her, and she fled the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten
lava.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="29">Chapter 29</h2><h3>Egocentric Bias</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, no one can be told who J. K. Rowling is. You have
to see her for yourself.</p>
<p>Science disclaimers: Luosha points out that the theory of
empathy in Ch. 27 (you use your own brain to simulate others) isn't
quite a known scientific fact. The evidence so far points in that
direction, but we haven't analyzed the brain circuitry and proven
it. Similarly, timeless formulations of quantum mechanics (alluded

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>There'd been a sinking feeling in Hermione's stomach lately,
every time she heard the other students talking about her and
Harry. She'd been in a shower stall this morning when she'd
overheard a conversation between Morag and Padma that had been the
last straw piled on top of quite a lot of other straws.</p>
<p>She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry
with Harry Potter had been a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>If she'd just <i>stayed away</i> from Harry Potter, she could
have been Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of
Hogwarts, who was earning more points for Ravenclaw than anyone.
She wouldn't have been <i>as</i> famous as the Boy-Who-Lived, but
she would have been famous for <i>herself</i>.</p>
<p>Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name
happened to be Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>And worse, she had gone on a date with him.</p>
<p>The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like an
appealing idea at first. She'd read books like that, and if there
was anyone in Hogwarts who was a candidate for the heroine's love
interest it was obviously Harry Potter. Bright, funny, famous,
sometimes scary...</p>
<p>So she'd forced Harry into going on a date with her.</p>
<p>And now <i>she</i> was <i>his</i> love interest.</p>
<p>Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu.</p>
<p>She'd been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn
on the water, when she'd heard giggles coming from outside. And
she'd heard Morag talking about how that Muggleborn girl probably
wouldn't fight hard enough to win against Ginevra Weasley, and
Padma speculating that Harry Potter might decide he wanted
<i>both</i>.</p>
<p>It was like they didn't understand that GIRLS had options on
their dinner menu and BOYS fought over them.</p>
<p>But that wasn't even the part that hurt, really. It was that
when she scored 98 on one of Professor McGonagall's tests, the news
wasn't that Hermione Granger had scored the highest in the class,
the news was that Harry Potter's rival had scored seven more points
than him.</p>
<p>If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of
his story.</p>
<p>You didn't get your own.</p>
<p>And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walk
away, but that would've been too sad.</p>
<p>But she did want to get <i>back</i> what she'd accidentally
given away by letting herself become known as Harry's rival. She
wanted to be a separate person again instead of Harry Potter's
third leg, was that too much to ask?</p>
<p>It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter
how high you scored in class, even if you did something that
deserved a special dinnertime announcement, it just meant you were
rivaling Harry Potter again.</p>
<p>But she thought she'd come up with a way.</p>
<p>Something to do that <i>wouldn't</i> be seen as pushing up on
the opposite end of Harry Potter's seesaw.</p>
<p>It would be hard.</p>
<p>It would go against her nature.</p>
<p>She would have to fight someone very evil.</p>
<p>And she would need to ask someone even <i>more</i> evil for
help.</p>
<p>Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door.</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>Hermione realized she was being <i>silly</i>, and raised her
hand a bit higher.</p>
<p>She tried to knock again.</p>
<p>Her hand quite failed to touch the door.</p>
<p>And then the door swung open anyway.</p>
<p>"Dear me," said the spider, sitting in its web. "Was it really
that hard to lose a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing
pink. It <i>had</i> been.</p>
<p>"Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful," said the evil
Professor Quirrell. "Consider it already lost. There, I have taken
a hard choice from you. Are you not grateful?"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Hermione managed to say in a voice that
squeaked a little. "I have a lot of Quirrell points, don't I?"</p>
<p>"You do indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "Though one less than
you had before. Terrible, isn't it? Just think, if I don't like
your reason for coming here, you could lose another fifty. Maybe
I'd take them away one... by one... by one..."</p>
<p>Hermione's cheeks were going even redder. "You're really evil,
did anyone ever tell you that?"</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," Professor Quirrell said gravely, "it can be
dangerous to give people compliments like that when they have not
been truly earned. The recipient might feel bashful and undeserving
and want to do something worthy of your praise. Now what was it you
wanted to talk to me about, Miss Granger?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was after lunch on Thursday afternoon, and Hermione and Harry
were ensconced in a little library nook, with a <i>Quietus</i>
field up so they could talk. Harry was lying stomach-down on the
ground with his elbows resting on the floor and his head in his
hands and his feet kicking up casually behind him. Hermione was
occupying a stuffed chair much too large for her, like she was the
Hermione center of a candy shell.</p>
<p>Harry had suggested that they could, as a first pass, read just
the <i>titles</i> of all the books in the library, and then
Hermione could read all the tables of contents.</p>
<p>Hermione had thought this was a brilliant idea. She'd never done
that with a library before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there was a slight flaw in this plan.</p>
<p>Namely, they were both Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>Hermione was reading a book called <i>Magical
Mnemonics.</i><i><br /></i></p>
<p>Harry was reading a book called <i>The Skeptical
Wizard.</i><i><br /></i></p>
<p>Each had thought it was just one special exception they would
make only this one time, and neither had yet realized it was
impossible for either of them to ever finish reading all the book
titles no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>The quiet of their little nook was broken by two words.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>," Harry suddenly said out loud, sounding like the
words had been torn out of him.</p>
<p>There was a bit more quiet.</p>
<p>"He <i>didn't</i>," Harry said, in the same voice.</p>
<p>Then she heard Harry start giggling helplessly.</p>
<p>Hermione looked up from her book.</p>
<p>"All right," she said, "what <i>is</i> it?"</p>
<p>"I just found out why you never ask the Weasleys about the
family rat," Harry said. "It's <i>really</i> awful and I shouldn't
be laughing and I'm a terrible person."</p>
<p>"Yes," Hermione said primly, "you are. Tell me too."</p>
<p>"Okay, first the background. There's a whole chapter in this
book about Sirius Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that
is, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend
of James Potter who'd betrayed the location of Harry's parents to
Voldemort.</p>
<p>"So it turns out there were a number of, shall we say,
<i>irregularities</i>, associated with Black going to Azkaban. He
didn't get a trial, and the Junior Minister in charge when the
Aurors arrested Black was none other than Cornelius Fudge, who
became our current Minister of Magic."</p>
<p>That sounded a little suspicious to Hermione too, and she said
as much.</p>
<p>Harry made a shrugging motion with his shoulders, as he lay on
the floor looking at his book. "Suspicious things happen all the
time, and if you're a conspiracy theorist you can always find
<i>something</i>."</p>
<p>"But <i>no trial?</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"It was right after the Dark Lord's defeat," Harry said, his
voice serious as he said it. "Things were incredibly chaotic, and
when the Aurors tracked down Black he was standing there laughing
in a street ankle-deep in blood, with twenty eyewitnesses to
recount how he'd killed a friend of my father's named Peter
Pettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I'm not saying I approve of Black
not getting a trial. But these are wizards we're talking about
here, so it's not really any more suspicious than, I don't know,
the sort of thing people point to when they want to argue over who
shot John F. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius Black is the wizarding Lee
Harvey Oswald. There's all sorts of conspiracy theories about who
<i>really</i> betrayed my parents instead of him, and one of the
favorites is Peter Pettigrew, and this is where it starts getting
complicated."</p>
<p>Hermione listened, fascinated. "But how do you go from there to
the Weasleys' <i>pet rat</i> -"</p>
<p>"Hold on," said Harry, "I'm getting there. Now, after
Pettigrew's death it came out that he'd been a spy for the Light -
not a double agent, just someone who snuck around and found things
out. He'd been good at that since he was a teenager, even in
Hogwarts he had a reputation for finding out all sorts of secrets.
So the conspiracy theory is that Pettigrew became an unregistered
Animagus while he was still in Hogwarts, an Animagus of something
small that could scurry around and listen to conversations. The
main problem being that successful Animagi are rare and doing it as
a teenager would be really unlikely, so of course the conspiracy
theory says that my father and Black were unregistered Animagi too.
And in that conspiracy theory, Pettigrew himself killed the twelve
bystanders, turned into his small Animagus form, and ran. So
Michael Shermer says there are four additional problems with this.
One, Black was the only one who knew where my parents were."
(Harry's voice was a little hard as he said that.) "Two, Black was
a more likely suspect to start with than Pettigrew, there's a rumor
Black deliberately tried to get a student killed during his time at
Hogwarts, and he was from this really nasty pureblood family,
Bellatrix Black was literally his cousin. Three, Black was twenty
times the fighting wizard that Pettigrew was, even if he wasn't as
smart. The duel between them would have been like Professor
Quirrell versus Professor Sprout. Pettigrew probably didn't even
get a chance to draw his wand, let alone fake all the evidence the
conspiracy theory requires. And four, Black was standing in the
street <i>laughing.</i>"</p>
<p>"But the <i>rat</i> -" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said. "Well, to make a long story short, Bill
Weasley decided that his little brother Percy's pet rat was
Pettigrew's Animagus form -"</p>
<p>Hermione's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "you wouldn't exactly expect Evil Pettigrew
to be living a sad and furtive life as the pet rat of an enemy
wizarding family, he'd either be with the Malfoys or, more likely,
off in the Carribean after a bit of plastic surgery. Anyway, Bill
knocks out his little brother Percy, stuns and grabs the rat, sends
out all these emergency owl messages -"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>no!</i>" Hermione said, the words torn out of her.</p>
<p>"- and somehow manages to gather Dumbledore, the Minister of
Magic, and the Head Auror -"</p>
<p>"He <i>didn't!</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"And of course when they get there they think he's crazy, but
they use <i>Veritas Oculum</i> on the rat anyway, just to be sure,
and what do they discover?"</p>
<p>She would've <i>died</i>. "A rat."</p>
<p>"You win a cookie! So they dragged poor Bill Weasley off to St.
Mungo's and it turned out to be a pretty standard schizophrenic
break, it just happens to some people, especially young men around
what we'd consider college age. Guy was convinced he was
ninety-seven years old and had died and gone back in time to his
younger self via train station. And he responded perfectly well to
antipsychotics and is back to normal and everything's fine now,
except people don't talk as much anymore about Sirius Black
conspiracy theories, and you don't ever ask the Weasleys about the
family rat."</p>
<p>Hermione was giggling helplessly. It was really awful and she
shouldn't be laughing and she was a terrible person.</p>
<p>"The thing I <i>don't</i> understand," Harry said, after their
giggles had died down, "is <i>why</i> Black would hunt down
Pettigrew instead of running as fast as he could. He had to know
the Aurors would be after him. I wonder if they got the reason out
of Black before they took him to Azkaban? See, this is why people
who are absolutely positively guilty still go through the legal
system and get trials."</p>
<p>Hermione had to agree with that.</p>
<p>Soon Harry was done with his book while Hermione was only
halfway through hers - hers was a much more difficult book than
Harry's, but she still felt embarrassed about that. And then she
had to put <i>Magical Mnemonics</i> back on the shelf and drag
herself away, because it was time for her to face the most dreaded
class in Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.</p>
<p>Harry tagged along as she walked there, even though his own
class wasn't until an hour and a half later, like a fighter jet
escorting a sad little propeller plane on its way to its own
funeral.</p>
<p>The boy wished her goodbye in a quiet, sympathetic voice, and
she walked onto the grassy fields of Doom.</p>
<p>And there was much shrieking and almost falling and horrible
brushes with death and the ground in completely the <i>wrong
place</i> and the sun getting in her eyes and Morag buzzing her and
Mandy thinking she was being <i>subtle</i> about always being near
enough to catch her if she fell and she <i>knew</i> the other
students were laughing at both of them but she never said anything
to Mandy because she didn't actually want to die.</p>
<p>After ten million years the class ended, and she was back on the
ground where she belonged until next Thursday. Sometimes she had
nightmares about it always being Thursday.</p>
<p><i>Why</i> everyone had to learn this, when they were just going
to Apparate or Floo or portkey everywhere once they grew up, was a
complete and utter mystery to Hermione. Nobody actually needed to
ride broomsticks as an adult, it was like being forced to play
dodgeball in P.E.</p>
<p>At least Harry had the decency to be ashamed of being good at
it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff
study hall with Hannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor
Flitwick, surprisingly diffident for a teacher, had asked if she
might possibly maybe help those four with their Charms homework for
a while, even though they weren't Ravenclaws, and Hermione had felt
so proud she'd almost <i>burst</i>.</p>
<p>Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink
on it, tore it into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the
pieces on the table.</p>
<p><i>She</i> could have gotten it just from crumpling it, but
doing all that made it more like garbage, and that helped when
someone was first practicing the Disposal Charm.</p>
<p>Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, "Okay, try
it."</p>
<p>"<i>Everto.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Everto.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Everto.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Everto.</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione didn't think she'd quite caught all the problems. "Can
you all try it again?"</p>
<p>An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Megan
were sort of sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practicing
something, they would, (2) Hannah and Susan were focused and driven
to the point where you had to keep telling them to <i>slow down</i>
and <i>relax</i> and <i>think</i> about things instead of
<i>trying</i> so hard - it was odd to think that those two would
soon be <i>hers</i> - and (3) she liked helping Hufflepuffs, the
whole study hall had a very cheerful atmosphere.</p>
<p>When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading a
book while he waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and
also a little worried because Harry didn't seem to really talk to
<i>anyone</i> besides her.</p>
<p>"Did you know there's a girl in Hufflepuff who's a
Metamorphmagus?" said Hermione as they headed toward the Great
Hall. "She makes her hair really red, like stopsign red not Weasley
red, and when she spilled hot tea on herself she turned into a
black-haired boy until she got it under control again."</p>
<p>"Really? Cool," said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. "Um,
Hermione, just to check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign
up for Professor Quirrell's armies, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Hermione said. "The armies of the evil Professor
Quirrell." Her voice was a little angry, though Harry didn't know
why, of course.</p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said, his voice exasperated, "he's not evil.
He's a little bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It's not the same
as being <i>evil</i>."</p>
<p>Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his
problem. He would have been better off if he'd just divided the
universe into Good and Bad. "Professor Quirrell called me up in
front of the whole class and told me to <i>shoot someone!</i>"</p>
<p>"He was right," Harry said, his face sober. "I'm sorry,
Hermione, but he was. You should have shot <i>me,</i> I wouldn't
have minded. You can't learn Battle Magic if you can't practice
against real opponents using real spells. And now you're doing okay
in sparring, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn't put
it into words, she couldn't find the thing to say that would
convince Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that
girl in front of everyone, and ordered her to open fire without
provocation on a classmate.</p>
<p>It didn't <i>matter</i> if Professor Quirrell was right about
her needing to learn it.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall wouldn't ever have done that.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick wouldn't ever have done that.</p>
<p>Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was <i>EVIL</i>.</p>
<p>But she couldn't find the words, and she knew that Harry would
never believe her.</p>
<p>"Hermione, I've talked to older students," Harry said.
"Professor Quirrell could be the <i>only</i> competent Defense
Professor we get in all seven years at Hogwarts. Anything else we
can learn later. If we want to study Defense, we have to do it
<i>this year.</i> The students who sign up for the extracurricular
stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way beyond what the
Ministry thinks first-years are supposed to study - did you know
we're going to be learning the Patronus Charm? In
<i>January?</i>"</p>
<p>"The <i>Patronus Charm?</i>" Hermione said, her voice going up
in surprise.</p>
<p>Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a
weapon against the Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive
emotions. It wasn't something she'd expect the evil Professor
Quirrell to teach - or arrange to be taught, since Hermione
couldn't imagine he could do the spell himself.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "Students don't usually learn the Patronus
Charm until their fifth years or even later! But Professor Quirrell
says the Ministry schedules were made up by talking Flobberworms,
and the ability to cast the Patronus Charm depends on emotions more
than magical strength. Professor Quirrell says that he thinks most
students do <i>way</i> less than they can, and this year he's going
to prove it."</p>
<p>There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry's voice had
when he talked about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her
teeth and kept walking.</p>
<p>"I already signed up, actually," Hermione said, her voice a
little quiet. "I did it this morning. For everything, just like you
said."</p>
<p><i>In for a penny, in for a pound</i> was the usual
expression.</p>
<p>Besides, she didn't want to <i>lose</i>, and if she wanted to
win she had to learn.</p>
<p>"So you <i>will</i> be in the armies, then?" Harry's voice was
suddenly enthusiastic. "That's awesome, Hermione! I've already
gotten my list of soldiers, but I'm sure Professor Quirrell will
let me add one more, or trade -"</p>
<p>"I'm not joining <i>your</i> army." Hermione's voice was sharp.
She knew it was a reasonable assumption but it <i>still</i> annoyed
her.</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Not Draco Malfoy's, surely. So you want to be in
the third army? Even though we don't know who the general <i>is</i>
yet?" Harry sounded surprised and a little wounded, and she
couldn't blame him, though of course she did blame him, since in
fact it was all his fault. "But why not mine?"</p>
<p>"Think about it," Hermione snapped, "and maybe you'll work it
out!"</p>
<p>And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Draco said in his most formal voice, "I
must protest your appointment of Hermione Granger as the third
general."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor Quirrell, leaning back in his chair in a
casual and relaxed manner. "Protest away, Mr. Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Granger is unfit for the position," said Draco.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully.
"Why yes, yes she is. Do you have any further protests?"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Harry Potter beside him, "with all
due respect to Miss Granger's many outstanding academic talents and
the Quirrell points she has justly earned in your classes, her
personality is not suited to military command."</p>
<p>Draco had been relieved when Harry had agreed to accompany him
to Professor Quirrell's office. It wasn't <i>just</i> that Harry
was a gigantic blatant teacher's pet where Professor Quirrell was
concerned. Draco had also started to worry that Harry actually
<i>was</i> friends with Granger, it had been a while now and he
<i>still</i> hadn't made his move... but this was more like it.</p>
<p>"I agree with Mr. Potter," said Draco. "Appointing her as a
general turns it into a farce."</p>
<p>"Harshly put," said Harry, "but I cannot bring myself to
disagree with Mr. Malfoy. To be blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione
Granger has around as much intent to kill as a bowl of wet
grapes."</p>
<p>"That," said Professor Quirrell mildly, "is not a thing I would
fail to notice myself. You are telling me nothing I do not already
know."</p>
<p>It was Draco's turn to say something, but the conversation had
suddenly hiccupped. That answer had <i>not</i> been in the
possibilities he and Harry had brainstormed before coming here.
What <i>did</i> you say after the teacher said that he knew
everything you knew and he was still going to commit an obvious
mistake?</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"Is this some sort of plot?" Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"Must everything I do be some sort of plot?" said Professor
Quirrell. "Can't I ever create chaos just for the sake of
chaos?"</p>
<p>Draco almost choked.</p>
<p>"Not in your Battle Magic class," Harry said with calm
certainty. "Other places, maybe, but not there."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell slowly raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Harry gazed steadily back at him.</p>
<p>Draco shivered.</p>
<p>"Well then," Professor Quirrell said. "Neither of you seem to
have considered a very simple question. Who could I appoint instead
of Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>"Blaise Zabini," Draco said without hesitation.</p>
<p>"Any other suggestions?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding quite
amused.</p>
<p><i>Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan,</i> came the thought,
before Draco's common sense kicked in and ruled out mudbloods and
Hufflepuffs no matter how aggressively they dueled. So instead
Draco just said, "What's wrong with Zabini?"</p>
<p>"I <i>see</i>..." Harry said slowly.</p>
<p>"I <i>don't,</i>" said Draco. "Why not Zabini?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at Draco. "Because, Mr. Malfoy, no
matter how hard he tries, he'll never be able to keep up with you
or Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>The shock of it staggered Draco. "You can't believe
<i>Granger</i> is going to -"</p>
<p>"He's gambling on her," Harry said quietly. "It's not
guaranteed. The odds aren't even good. She'll probably never give
us a good fight, and even if she does, it may take her months to
learn. But she's the only one in our year with any chance at all of
growing to beat us."</p>
<p>Draco's hands twitched but didn't clench into fists. Showing up
as your supporter and then backing out was a classic undermining
tactic, so Harry Potter <i>was</i> in it with Granger and
<i>that</i> implied -</p>
<p>"But Professor," Harry went on smoothly, "I'm worried Hermione
will be <i>miserable</i> as the general of an army. I'm speaking as
her friend now, Professor Quirrell. The competition might be good
for Draco and me, but what you're asking her to do isn't good for
<i>her!</i>"</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>
<p>"Your friendship for Hermione Granger does you credit,"
Professor Quirrell said dryly. "Especially as you are able to be
friends with Draco Malfoy at the same time. Quite a feat,
that."</p>
<p>Harry suddenly looked a little nervous, meaning he probably felt
a lot <i>more</i> nervous, and Draco silently swore to himself. Of
course Harry wasn't going to fool Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate your friendly
concern," said Professor Quirrell. "She asked me for the position,
Mr. Potter, I did not ask her."</p>
<p>Harry was quiet at this for a moment. Then he flashed Draco a
quick look that mixed apology and warning, saying at the same time,
<i>Sorry, I did my best</i> and <i>We'd better not press it any
further.</i></p>
<p>"As for her being miserable," Professor Quirrell went on, a
slight smile now playing about his lips, "I suspect that she will
have a much easier time with the rigors of her position than either
of you suspect, and that she will put up a good fight much sooner
than you think."</p>
<p>Harry and Draco both gasped in horror.</p>
<p>"You're not going to <i>advise</i> her, are you?" said Draco,
utterly aghast.</p>
<p>"I never signed up to fight <i>you!</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>The smile playing around Professor Quirrell's lips grew wider.
"As a matter of fact, I <i>did</i> offer to share a few suggestions
regarding Miss Granger's first battles."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Quirrell!</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," Professor Quirrell said. "She turned me down.
Just as I expected."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"Dear me, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "didn't anyone
ever tell you it's rude to stare?"</p>
<p>"You're not going to secretly help her some <i>other</i> way,
are you?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Would I do that?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco and Harry at the same time.</p>
<p>"I am wounded by your lack of trust. Well then, I promise not to
help General Granger in any way that the two of you don't know
about. And now I suggest that both of you be about your military
affairs. November approaches, and swiftly."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the
way behind them on their way out of Professor Quirrell's
office.</p>
<p>Harry had once spoken dismissively of "people stuff".</p>
<p>And now that was Draco's only hope.</p>
<p>Let him not realize, let him not realize...</p>
<p>"We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of
our way," said Draco. "After we crush her, we can have our own
contest without any distractions."</p>
<p>"Now that doesn't really seem fair to her, does it?" said Harry
in a mild voice.</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> care?" said Draco. "She's your rival,
right?" Then, with just the right note of suspicion in his voice,
"Don't tell me you've started <i>really</i> liking her, after being
her rival all this time..."</p>
<p>"Founders forbid," said Harry. "What can I say, Draco? I merely
have a natural sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She
has a very firm grasp on good and evil, and she's probably going to
attack evil first. Having a name like 'Malfoy' is just asking for
it, you know."</p>
<p><i>DAMN IT!</i></p>
<p>"Harry," said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little
superior, "don't you want to fight <i>fairly</i> against me?"</p>
<p>"You mean rather than attacking you after you've already lost
some of your forces beating Granger?" said Harry. "Oh, I don't
know. Maybe after I get bored with just winning I'll try that
'fair' thing."</p>
<p>"Maybe she'll attack <i>you,</i>" Draco said. "<i>You're</i> her
rival."</p>
<p>"But I'm her <i>friendly</i> rival," Harry said with an evil
grin. "I bought her a nice birthday present and everything. You
wouldn't go around sabotaging your friendly rival like that."</p>
<p>"What about sabotaging your <i>friend's</i> chance at a fair
fight?" said Draco angrily. "I thought we were friends!"</p>
<p>"Let me rephrase that," said Harry. "<i>Granger</i> wouldn't
sabotage a friendly rival. But that's because she has the killing
intention of a bowl of wet grapes. <i>You</i> would. You
<i>totally</i> would. And guess what, so would I."</p>
<p><i>DAMN IT!</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>If it had been a play, there would have been dramatic music.</p>
<p>The hero, impeccably turned out in green-trimmed robes and
perfectly combed white-blonde hair, faced the villain.</p>
<p>The villain, leaning back in a simple wooden chair with her
buckteeth clearly visible and stray chestnut curls drifting over
her cheeks, faced the hero.</p>
<p>It was Wednesday, October 30th, and the first battle was coming
up on Sunday.</p>
<p>Draco was standing in General Granger's office, a room the size
of a small classroom. (<i>Why</i> each general's office was so
large, Draco wasn't quite sure. A chair and a desk would have
worked for him. He wasn't even clear on why the generals needed
offices at all, his soldiers knew where to find him. Unless
Professor Quirrell had deliberately arranged the huge offices for
them as a sign of status, in which case Draco was all for it.)</p>
<p>Granger sat on the room's single chair like a throne, all the
way on the other end of the office from where the door opened.
There was a long oblong table stretched across the middle of the
room between them, and four small circular tables scattered around
the corners, but only that one single chair, all the way at the
opposite end. The room had windows along one wall, and one beam of
sunlight touched the top of Granger's hair like a glowing
crown.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if Draco could have walked slowly
forward. But there was a table in the way, and Draco had to go
around it diagonally, and there was no good way to do that in a
dramatic and dignified fashion. Had that been deliberate? If it had
been his father, it surely would have been; but this was Granger,
so surely not.</p>
<p>There was nowhere for him to sit, and Granger hadn't stood up,
either.</p>
<p>Draco kept the outrage entirely off his face.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy," Granger said once he stood before her,
"you requested an audience with me and I have been so gracious as
to grant it. What was your plea?"</p>
<p><i>Come with me to visit Malfoy Manor, my father and I would
like to show you some interesting spells.<br /></i></p>
<p>"Your rival, Potter, came to me with an offer," said Draco,
putting a serious look on his face. "He doesn't mind losing to me,
but would be humiliated if you won. So he wants to join with me and
wipe you out immediately, not just in our first battle, all of
them. If I won't do that, Potter wants me to hold back or harass
you, while he launches an all-out attack on you as his first
move."</p>
<p>"I see," Granger said, looking surprised. "And you're offering
to help me against him?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Draco smoothly. "I didn't think what he wanted
to do to you was fair."</p>
<p>"Why, that's very nice of you, Mr. Malfoy," said Granger. "I'm
sorry for how I spoke to you earlier. We should be friends. Can I
call you Drakey?"</p>
<p>Alarm bells started to sound in Draco's head, but there was a
<i>chance</i> she meant it...</p>
<p>"Of course," said Draco, "if I can call you Hermy."</p>
<p>Draco was pretty sure he saw her expression flicker.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Draco said, "I was thinking it would serve Potter
right if we both attacked him and wiped him out."</p>
<p>"But that wouldn't be fair to Mr. Potter, would it?" said
Granger.</p>
<p>"I think it'd be very fair," Draco said. "He was planning to do
it to you first."</p>
<p>Granger was giving him a stern look that could possibly have
intimidated him if he'd been a Hufflepuff instead of a Malfoy. "You
think I'm pretty stupid, don't you, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco smiled charmingly. "No, Miss Granger, but I thought I'd at
least <i>check.</i> So, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Are you offering to <i>bribe</i> me?" said Granger.</p>
<p>"Sure," said Draco. "Can I just slip you a Galleon and have you
beat on Potter instead of me for the rest of the year?"</p>
<p>"Nope," said Granger, "but you can offer me ten Galleons and
have me attack both of you equally, instead of just you."</p>
<p>"Ten Galleons is a lot of money," Draco said cautiously.</p>
<p>"I didn't know the Malfoys were poor," said Granger.</p>
<p>Draco stared at Granger.</p>
<p>He was starting to get a strange feeling about this.</p>
<p>That particular reply didn't seem like it should have come from
this particular girl.</p>
<p>"Well," said Draco, "you don't get to be rich by wasting money,
you know."</p>
<p>"I don't know if you know what a dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, but my
parents are <i>dentists</i> and anything less than ten Galleons
isn't worth my time at all."</p>
<p>"Three Galleons," Draco said, more as a probe than anything
else.</p>
<p>"Nope," said Granger. "If you want an equal fight at all, I
don't believe that a Malfoy wants an equal fight less than he wants
ten Galleons."</p>
<p>Draco was starting to get a <i>very</i> strange feeling about
this.</p>
<p>"No," said Draco.</p>
<p>"No?" said Granger. "This is a limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy.
Are you sure you want to risk a whole year of being miserably
crushed by the Boy-Who-Lived? That would be pretty embarrassing for
the House of Malfoy, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>It was a very persuasive argument, one that was hard to refuse,
but you didn't get to be rich by spending money when your heart
told you it was a setup.</p>
<p>"No," said Draco.</p>
<p>"See you on Sunday," said Granger.</p>
<p>Draco turned and walked out of the office without another
word.</p>
<p>That had been <i>not right...</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hermione," Harry said patiently, "we're <i>supposed</i> to be
plotting against each other. You could even betray me and it
wouldn't mean anything outside the battlefield."</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. "It wouldn't be nice, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "I don't think you're getting into the spirit of
this at all."</p>
<p><i>It wouldn't be nice.</i> She'd actually said that. Hermione
didn't know whether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or
worried about whether she really <i>did</i> sound like that much of
a goody-two-shoes usually.</p>
<p>It was probably time to change the subject.</p>
<p>"Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?" said
Hermione. "It's -"</p>
<p>Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized.</p>
<p>"Yes, Hermione," Harry said a little tightly, "what day is
it?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Interlude:</i></p>
<p>There was a time when October 31st had been called Halloween in
magical Britain.</p>
<p>Now it was Harry Potter Day.</p>
<p>Harry had turned down all the offers, even the one from Minister
Fudge which might have been good for future political favors and
which he <i>really</i> should have gritted his teeth and taken. But
to Harry, October 31st would always be The Dark Lord Killed My
Parents Day. There should have been a quiet, dignified memorial
service somewhere, and if there was one, he hadn't been
invited.</p>
<p>Hogwarts got the day off to celebrate. Even the Slytherins
didn't dare wear black outside their own dorm. There were special
events and special foods and the teachers looked the other way if
anyone ran through the hallways. It was the tenth anniversary,
after all.</p>
<p>Harry spent the day in his trunk so as not to spoil it for
anyone else, eating snack bars in place of meals, reading some of
his sadder science fiction books (no fantasy), and writing a letter
to Mum and Dad that was much longer than the ones he usually
sent.</p>

1</h3>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The day was Sunday, November 3rd, and soon the three great
powers of their school year, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and
Hermione Granger, would begin their struggle for supreme
dominance.</p>
<p>(Harry was slightly annoyed by the way the Boy-Who-Lived had
been demoted from supreme dominance to one of three equal rivals
just by entering the contest, but he expected to get it back
soon.)</p>
<p>The battleground was a section of non-Forbidden forest, dense
with trees, because Professor Quirrell thought that being able to
see all the enemy forces was too boring even for your very first
battle.</p>
<p>All the students who were not actually <i>in</i> a first-year
army were camped out nearby and watching on screens that Professor
Quirrell had set up. Except for three Gryffindors in their fourth
year, who were currently sick and confined to healer's beds by
Madam Pomfrey. Aside from that, everyone was there.</p>
<p>The students were dressed, not in their ordinary school robes,
but in Muggle camouflage uniforms that Professor Quirrell had
obtained somewhere and supplied in sufficient quantity and variety
to fit everyone. It wasn't that students would have worried about
stains and rips, that was what Charms were for. But as Professor
Quirrell had explained to the surprised wizardborns, nice dignified
clothing was not efficient for hiding in forests or dodging around
trees.</p>
<p>And on each uniform's breast, a patch bearing the name and
insignia of your army. A <i>small</i> patch. If you wanted your
soldiers to wear, say, colored ribbons so that they could identify
each other at a distance, and risk the enemy getting their hands on
the ribbons, that was all up to you.</p>
<p>Harry had tried to get the name Dragon Army.</p>
<p>Draco had pitched a fit and said that would confuse everyone
completely.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had ruled that Draco could lay prior claim to
the name, if he wished.</p>
<p>So now Harry was fighting Dragon Army.</p>
<p>This probably wasn't a good sign.</p>
<p>For their insignia, instead of the too-obvious dragon's head
breathing fire, Draco had elected to simply go with the fire.
Elegant, understated, deadly: <i>This is what's left after we've
passed.</i> Very Malfoy.</p>
<p>Harry, after considering alternate choices such as the 501st
Provisional Battalion and Harry's Minions o' Doom, had decided that
his army would be known by the simple and dignified appellation of
the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>Their insignia was a hand poised with fingers ready to snap.</p>
<p>It was <i>universally</i> agreed that this wasn't a good
sign.</p>
<p>Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys serving
under her were probably nervous about her being a girl with a
reputation for being nice, and that she should pick something scary
that would reassure them of her toughness and make them proud to be
part of her army, like the Blood Commandos or something.</p>
<p>Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.</p>
<p>Their insignia was a smiley face.</p>
<p>And in ten minutes, they would be at war.</p>
<p>Harry stood in the bright forest clearing that was their
assigned starting location, an area of open space with old and
rotting tree stumps that had been cleared away for some unknown
purpose, ground coated with a small scattering of blown leaves and
the dried grey remnants of grass that had failed the test of
summer's heat, and the sun shining down brilliantly from above.</p>
<p>Around him were the twenty-three soldiers that Professor
Quirrell had assigned to him. Nearly all of Gryffindor had signed
up, of course, and more than half of Slytherin, and less than half
of Hufflepuff, and a handful of Ravenclaw. In Harry's army there
were twelve Gryffindors and six Slytherins and four Hufflepuffs and
one Ravenclaw besides himself... not that there was any way to tell
that by looking at the uniforms. No red, no green, no yellow, no
blue. Just Muggle camouflage patterns, and a patch on the breast
with the device of a hand poised to snap its fingers.</p>
<p>Harry looked upon his twenty-three soldiers, all wearing the
same uniforms with no marks of group identity save that single
patch.</p>
<p>And lo, Harry smiled, because he understood what this part of
Professor Quirrell's master plan was about; and Harry was taking
full advantage of it for his <i>own</i> purposes, too.</p>
<p>There was a legendary episode in social psychology called the
Robbers Cave experiment. It had been set up in the bewildered
aftermath of World War II, with the intent of investigating the
causes and remedies of conflicts between groups. The scientists had
set up a summer camp for 22 boys from 22 different schools,
selecting them to all be from stable middle-class families. The
first phase of the experiment had been intended to investigate what
it took to <i>start</i> a conflict between groups. The 22 boys had
been divided into two groups of 11 -</p>
<p>- and this had been quite sufficient.</p>
<p>The hostility had started from the moment the two groups had
become aware of each others' existences in the state park, insults
being hurled on the first meeting. They'd named themselves the
Eagles and the Rattlers (they hadn't needed names for themselves
when they thought they were the only ones in the park) and had
proceeded to develop contrasting group stereotypes, the Rattlers
thinking of themselves as rough-and-tough and swearing heavily, the
Eagles correspondingly deciding to think of themselves as
upright-and-proper.</p>
<p>The other part of the experiment had been testing how to resolve
group conflicts. Bringing the boys together to watch fireworks
hadn't worked at all. They'd just shouted at each other and stayed
apart. What <i>had</i> worked was warning them that there might be
vandals in the park, and the two groups needing to work together to
solve a failure of the park's water system. A common task, a common
enemy.</p>
<p>Harry had a strong suspicion Professor Quirrell had understood
this principle very well indeed when he had chosen to create
<i>three</i> armies per year.</p>
<p><i>Three</i> armies.</p>
<p>Not <i>four</i>.</p>
<p>And definitely <i>not</i> segregated by House... except that no
Slytherins had been assigned to Draco besides Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle.</p>
<p>It was things like this which reassured Harry that Professor
Quirrell, despite his affected Dark atmosphere and his pretense of
neutrality in the conflict between Good and Evil, was secretly
backing Good, not that Harry would ever dare say that out loud.</p>
<p>And Harry had decided to take full advantage of Professor
Quirrell's plan to define a group identity <i>his</i> way.</p>
<p>The Rattlers, once they'd met the Eagles, had started thinking
of themselves as rough-and-tough, and they'd conducted themselves
accordingly.</p>
<p>The Eagles had thought of themselves as good-and-proper.</p>
<p>And in that bright forest clearing, scattered around the old and
rotting tree stumps, outlined in the sun shining down brilliantly
from above, General Potter and his twenty-three soldiers were
arranged in nothing remotely resembling a formation. Some soldiers
stood, some soldiers sat, some stood on one leg just to be
different.</p>
<p>It was the <i>Chaos</i> Legion, after all.</p>
<p>And if there wasn't a <i>reason</i> to stand in neat little
lines, Harry had said disdainfully, there weren't going to be neat
little lines.</p>
<p>Harry had divided the army into 6 squads of 4 soldiers each,
each squad commanded by a Squad Suggester. All troops were under
strict orders to disobey any orders they were given if it seemed
like a good idea at the time, including that one... unless Harry or
the Squad Suggester prefixed the order with "Merlin says", in which
case you were supposed to actually obey.</p>
<p>The Chaos Legion's chief attack was to split up and run in from
multiple directions, randomly changing vectors and firing the
approved sleep spell as rapidly as you could rebuild the magical
strength. And if you saw a chance to distract or confuse the enemy,
you took it.</p>
<p>Fast. Creative. Unpredictable. Non-homogenous. Don't just obey
orders, think about whether what you're doing <i>right now</i>
makes sense.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't quite as sure as he'd pretended that this was the
optimum of military efficiency... but he'd been given a golden
opportunity to change how some students <i>thought about
themselves,</i> and that was how he intended to use it.</p>
<p>Five minutes to wartime, according to Harry's watch.</p>
<p>General Potter walked (not marched) over to where his air force
was waiting tensely, broomsticks already clutched firmly in their
hands.</p>
<p>"All wings report in," said General Potter. They'd rehearsed
this during their one training session on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Red Leader standing by," said Seamus Finnigan, who had no idea
what it meant.</p>
<p>"Red Five standing by," said Dean Thomas, who'd waited his
entire life to say it.</p>
<p>"Green Leader standing by," Theodore Nott said rather
stiffly.</p>
<p>"Green Forty-One standing by," Tracey Davis said.</p>
<p>"I want you in the air the instant we hear the bell," said
General Potter. "Do not engage, repeat, do not engage. Evade if
under fire." (Of course you did <i>not</i> aim sleep spells at
broomsticks; you fired a spell that gave a temporary red glow to
whatever it hit. If you hit the broomstick or the rider, they were
out of the war.) "Red Leader and Red Five, fly toward Malfoy's army
as fast as you can, stay as high as you can while still seeing
them, return the instant you know for sure what they're doing.
Green Leader, do the same for Granger's army. Green Forty-One, fly
above us and watch for any approaching broomsticks or soldiers, you
and only you are authorized to fire. And remember, I didn't say
'Merlin says' for any of that, but we <i>do</i> really need the
information. For Chaos!"</p>
<p>"For Chaos!" the four echoed with varying degrees of
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Harry expected Hermione to launch an immediate attack on Draco,
in which case he'd move his troops into position and start
supporting her, but only after she'd taken severe losses and caused
some damage. He would frame it as a heroic rescue, if possible; it
wouldn't do to have Sunshine thinking that Chaos wasn't their
friend, after all.</p>
<p>But just in case she <i>didn't</i>... well, that was why the
Chaos Legion was staying put until Green Leader reported back.</p>
<p>Draco's moves would be in his own self-interest. He would
predictably ready his army to defend against Hermione; he might or
might not realize that Harry had been lying about waiting to attack
until after that battle finished. Harry had still put two
broomsticks on Dragon Army, just in case they <i>were</i> doing
something, and just in case Draco or Mr. Goyle or Mr. Crabbe was
good enough to shoot a broomstick out of the sky.</p>
<p>But General Granger was the unpredictable one, and Harry
couldn't move until he knew how she was moving.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In the heart of the forest, with shadow patterns dancing on the
ground as leafy canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood
where the trees were relatively sparser, and looked out on his
troops with calm satisfaction. Six units of three troops each, the
Aerial Unit of four (to which Gregory was assigned), and the
Command Unit, which was himself and Vincent. They'd only drilled
for a short time on the previous Saturday, but Draco was confident
that he'd managed to explain the basics. Stay with your mates,
watch their back and trust them to watch yours. Move as a single
body. Obey orders and show no fear. Aim, fire, move, aim again,
fire again.</p>
<p>The six units were formed up in a defensive perimeter around
Draco, watchfully gazing outward into the forest. Back-to-back they
stood, wands gripped low until they needed to strike.</p>
<p>They already looked remarkably like the Auror units whose
training Draco had watched during his father's inspections.</p>
<p>Chaos and Sunshine weren't going to know what hit them.</p>
<p>"Attention," said General Malfoy.</p>
<p>The six units unfolded and spun toward Draco; the faces of his
broomstick riders turned from where they stood with broomsticks
already in hand.</p>
<p>Draco had decided to wait on demanding salutes until after they
won their first battle, when Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs would be
more willing to salute a Malfoy.</p>
<p>But his soldiers were already standing straight enough,
especially the Gryffindors, that Draco wondered if he'd even needed
to delay. Gregory had quietly listened, and reported back that
Draco's volunteering to stand by Harry Potter in Defense class,
that time when Professor Quirrell had taught Harry how to lose, had
marked Draco as an acceptable commander. At least if you happened
to be assigned to his army. <i>Not all Slytherins are alike; there
are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins</i> was what the
Gryffindors in Draco's army were quoting to their Housemates.</p>
<p>Draco was frankly <i>astounded</i> at how incredibly <i>easy</i>
that had been. Draco had protested at first about not being
assigned any Slytherins, and Professor Quirrell had told him that
if he wanted to be the first Malfoy to gain complete political
control of the country, he needed to learn how to govern the other
three-quarters of the population. It was things like this which
reassured Draco that Professor Quirrell had a great deal more
sympathy for the good guys than Professor Quirrell was letting
on.</p>
<p>The actual battle wouldn't be easy, especially if Granger did
attack the Dragons first. Draco had agonized over whether to commit
all his forces against Granger immediately in a preemptive strike,
but had worried that (1) Harry had been misleading him completely
about what Granger was likely to do, and (2) Harry had been
misleading him about waiting until after Granger's attack to join
the battle.</p>
<p>Though Dragon Army had a secret weapon, three of them in fact,
which might be enough to win even if they were attacked by both
armies at once...</p>
<p>It was almost time, and that meant it was time for the
pre-battle speech that Draco had composed and memorized.</p>
<p>"The battle is about to begin," Draco said. His voice was calm
and precise. "Remember everything that I and Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle showed you. An army wins because it is disciplined and
deadly. General Potter and the Chaos Legion will not be
disciplined. Granger and the Sunshine Regiment will not be deadly.
We are disciplined, we are deadly, we are Dragons. The battle is
about to begin, and we are about to win it."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>(Ex tempore speech given by General Potter to the Chaos
Legion, immediately before their first battle, on November 3rd,
1991, at 2:56pm:)</i></p>
<p>My troops, I'm not going to lie to you, our situation today is
very grim. Dragon Army has never lost a single battle. And Hermione
Granger... has a very good memory. The truth is, most of you are
probably going to die. And the survivors will envy the dead. But we
have to win this. We have to win this so that someday, our children
can enjoy the taste of chocolate again. Everything is at stake
here. Literally everything. If we lose, the whole universe just
blinks out like a light bulb. And now I realize that most of you
don't know what a light bulb is. Well, take it from me, it's bad.
But if we have to go down, let's go down fighting, like heroes, so
that as the darkness closes in, we can think to ourselves, <i>at
least we had fun.</i> Are you afraid to die? I know I am. I can
feel those cold shivers of fear like someone is pumping ice cream
into my shirt. But I know... that history is watching us. It was
watching us when we changed into our uniforms. It was probably
taking pictures. And history, my troops, is written by the victors.
If we win this, we can write our own history. A history in which
Hogwarts was founded by four renegade house elves. We can make
everyone study that history, even though it isn't true, and if they
don't answer the right way on our tests... they'll fail the class.
Isn't that worth dying for? No, don't answer that. Some things are
better left unknown. None of us know why we're here. None of us
know why we're fighting. We just woke up in these uniforms in this
mysterious forest, knowing only that there was no way to get our
names and memories back except victory. The students in those other
armies out there... they're just like us. They don't want to die.
They're fighting to protect each other, the only friends they have
left. They're fighting because they know they have families who'll
miss them, even if they can't remember now. They may even be
fighting to save the world. But we have a better reason to fight
than they do. We fight because we like it. We fight to amuse
eldritch monstrosities from beyond Space and Time. We fight because
we're Chaos. Soon the final battle will begin, so let me say now,
because I won't get a chance later, that it was an honor to be your
commander, however briefly. Thank you, thank you all. And remember,
your goal isn't just to cut down the enemy, it's to make them
afraid.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A great booming gong echoed over the forest.</p>
<p>And the Sunshine Regiment began to march.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The tension rose and rose, as Harry and the nineteen other
soldiers who remained waited for the aerial warriors to report
back. It shouldn't take long, broomsticks were fast and the
distances in the forest were not great -</p>
<p>Two broomsticks approached, at speed, from the direction of
Draco's camp, and all the soldiers tensed. They weren't executing
the maneuvers that were today's code for a <i>friendly</i>
broomstick.</p>
<p>"<i>Scatter and fire!</i>" roared General Potter, and then
suited action to words, scurrying off at top speed toward the
forest cover; and then as soon as Harry was among the trees, he
spun back, raised his wand, tried to seek out the broomstick in the
sky -</p>
<p>"Clear!" shouted a voice. "They're heading back!"</p>
<p>Harry gave a mental shrug. There'd been no way to prevent Draco
from obtaining that information, and he'd only learn that they'd
been standing still.</p>
<p>And the Chaotics slowly emerged from the forest -</p>
<p>"Broomstick approaching from Granger's direction!" yelled
another voice. "I think it's Green Leader, he did the dip and
roll!"</p>
<p>Moments later Theodore Nott dived out of the sky and pulled up
in the midst of the soldiers.</p>
<p>"Granger has divided her forces in two!" yelled Nott as he
hovered on his broomstick. There was sweat staining his uniform,
and all the reserve was gone from his voice. "She's attacking both
armies! Two brooms covering each force, they pursued me halfway
here!"</p>
<p><i>Divided her army, what on Earth -</i></p>
<p>A large force concentrating fire on a small force could deplete
that force rapidly without taking much damage in return. If twenty
soldiers faced ten soldiers, twenty sleep spells would be aimed at
the ten soldiers with only ten sleep spells going the other way, so
unless every one of those first sleep spells hit its target, the
smaller force would lose more people than they could manage to take
down with them. <i>Defeated in detail</i> was the military term for
what happened when you divided your forces like that. What could
Hermione <i>possibly</i> be thinking...</p>
<p>Then Harry realized.</p>
<p><i>She's being fair.</i></p>
<p>It was going to be a long year in Defense class.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said loudly, so the army could hear. "We'll
wait until the Red Wing reports in, and then we'll go cloud up some
Sunshine."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco listened to the flyers' reports with his face calm, all
his shock concealed inside. What could Granger <i>possibly</i> be
thinking?</p>
<p>Then Draco realized.</p>
<p><i>It's a feint.</i></p>
<p>One of Sunshine's two forces would change direction, and both
would converge on... who?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Neville Longbottom marched through the forest toward the
approaching Sunny force, occasionally glancing up at the sky for
broomsticks. Beside him marched his squad comrades, Melvin Coote
and Lavender Brown of Gryffindor, and Allen Flint of Slytherin.
Allen Flint was their Squad Suggester, though Harry had first said
to Neville, in private, that the position was his if he wanted
it.</p>
<p>Harry had said quite a lot of things to Neville in private,
starting with "You know, Neville, if you want to become as awesome
as the imaginary Neville who lives in your head but isn't allowed
to do anything because you're scared, then you really should sign
up for Professor Quirrell's armies."</p>
<p>Neville was now <i>sure</i> the Boy-Who-Lived could read minds.
There was just no other way Harry Potter could've known. Neville
had never talked about that with <i>anyone</i>, or given any sign;
and <i>other</i> people weren't like that, not that Neville had
ever noticed.</p>
<p>And Harry's promise had come true, this <i>did</i> feel
different from sparring in Defense class. Neville had hoped that
sparring would fix everything that was wrong with him, and, well,
it hadn't. Even if he could fire a few spells at another student in
class with Professor Quirrell watching to make sure nothing went
wrong, even if he could dodge and fire back when it was
<i>allowed</i> and everyone else was <i>expecting</i> it and they
would stare at him funny if he <i>didn't</i> do it, none of that
was the same as being able to stand up for himself.</p>
<p>But being part of an <i>army...</i></p>
<p>Something strange was stirring inside Neville, as he marched
through the forest alongside his comrades, upon their uniforms an
insignia of fingers poised to snap.</p>
<p>He was allowed to walk if he wanted to, but he just felt like
marching.</p>
<p>Beside him, Melvin and Lavender and Allen all seemed to feel
like marching too.</p>
<p>And Neville softly began to sing the Song of Chaos.</p>
<p>The tune was what a Muggle would have identified as John
Williams's Imperial March, also known as "Darth Vader's Theme"; and
the words Harry had added were easy to remember.</p>
<p><i>Doom doom doom<br />
Doom doom doom doom doom doom<br />
Doom doom doom<br />
Doom doom doom doom doom doom<br />
DOOM doom DOOM<br />
Doom doom doom-doom-doom doom doom<br />
Doom doom-doom-doom doom doom<br />
Doom doom doom, doom doom doom.</i></p>
<p>By the second line the others had joined in, and soon you could
hear the same soft chant coming from nearby parts of the
forest.</p>
<p>And Neville marched alongside his fellow Chaos
Legionnaires,<br />
strange feelings stirring in his heart,<br />
imagination becoming reality,<br />
as from his lips poured a fearful song of doom.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry stared at the bodies scattered across the forest.
Something inside him felt a bit queasy, and he had to remind
himself hard that they were only sleeping. There were girls among
the fallen, and that made it a lot worse somehow, and he would have
to be careful never to mention that in front of Hermione or the
Aurors would find his remains stuffed into a <i>small</i>
teapot.</p>
<p>Half of Sunshine army hadn't put up much of a fight against all
of Chaos. The nine ground soldiers had run in screaming
inarticulately with Simple Shields raised, circular screens to
protect their faces and chests. But you couldn't fire and hold the
shield at the same time, and Harry's soldiers had simply aimed for
the legs. All but one of the Sunnies had fallen over as soon as the
cries of "<i>Somnium!</i>" filled the air. That last one had
dropped her shield and managed to take out one of Harry's soldiers
before being hit by the second wave of sleep spells (the Sleep Hex
was safe for multiple hits). The two Sunny broomsticks had been
much harder to take down and had accounted for three Chaotics
before being auraed by massed ground fire.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't among the fallen. Draco must have gotten her and
that was making Harry feel <i>angry</i> on some completely
incomprehensible level, he wasn't sure if he was feeling protective
toward Hermione, or cheated that he hadn't been the one to do it,
or maybe <i>both.</i></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, raising his voice. "Let's everyone be
clear on one thing, that wasn't a real fight. That was General
Granger making a mistake in her first battle. Today's actual fight
is with Dragon Army and it's not going to be anything like this.
It's going to be a lot more fun. Let's move out."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A broomstick fell out of the sky, approaching terrifyingly fast,
and spun on its end and decelerated so hard you could almost hear
the air screaming in protest, and came to a halt directly beside
Draco.</p>
<p>It wasn't dangerous showing-off. Gregory Goyle simply <i>was</i>
that good and he didn't waste time.</p>
<p>"Potter's coming," Gregory said with no trace of his usual fake
drawl. "They've still got all four of their brooms, you want me to
take them out?"</p>
<p>"No," Draco said sharply. "Fighting over their army gives them
too much of an advantage, they'll fire on you from the ground and
even you might not be able to dodge it all. Wait until the forces
engage."</p>
<p>Draco had lost four Dragons in exchange for twelve Sunnies.
Apparently General Granger actually <i>had</i> been that incredibly
stupid, though she hadn't been among the attackers, so Draco hadn't
gotten a chance to taunt her or ask her what in Merlin's name she
had been thinking.</p>
<p>The true battle, they all knew, would be with Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"Prepare yourselves!" roared Draco at his troops. "Stay together
with your mates, act as a unit, fire as soon as the enemy is in
range!"</p>
<p>Discipline against Chaos.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be much of a fight.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The adrenaline was pumping and pumping into Neville's blood
until he felt like he could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>"We're closing in," said General Potter in a voice barely loud
enough to carry to the whole army. "Time to spread out."</p>
<p>Neville's comrades moved away from him. They would still support
each other, but if you clustered together, the enemy would have a
much easier time hitting you; fire aimed at one of your comrades
might miss and get you instead. You would be a lot harder to hit if
you spread out and moved as fast as you could.</p>
<p>The first thing General Potter had done, during their training
session, was get them to fire on each other when both sides were
running fast, or both stood still and took time to aim, or one was
moving and one was standing still - the reverse charm to the Sleep
Hex was simple, though you weren't allowed to use it during real
battles. General Potter had carefully recorded everything that
happened, done some figuring and ciphering, and then announced that
it made more sense for them to focus, not on slowing down to aim
carefully, but on moving fast so they wouldn't get hit.</p>
<p>It still bothered Neville a little not to be marching
side-by-side with his comrades, but the scary battlecries they'd
learned were already thundering in his head and that made up for a
lot.</p>
<p>This time, Neville silently vowed to himself, his voice was
absolutely positively not going to squeak.</p>
<p>"Shields up," said General Potter, "power to forward
deflectors."</p>
<p>"<i>Contego,</i>" murmured the army, and the circular screens
sprang into existence before their heads and chests.</p>
<p>A sharp taste filled Neville's mouth. General Potter wouldn't
have ordered them to cast shields unless they were almost in range.
Neville could see the uniformed shapes of Dragons moving through
the dense screens of trees, and the Dragons would be seeing them as
well -</p>
<p>"<i>Attack!</i>" came a cry from the distance, the voice of
Draco Malfoy, and General Potter bellowed, "<i>Charge -</i>"</p>
<p>All the adrenaline in Neville's blood was unleashed, and his
legs took over, sending him flying faster than he'd ever run
before, straight toward the enemy, knowing without needing to look
that all his comrades were doing the same.</p>
<p>"<i>Blood for the blood god!</i>" screamed Neville. "<i>Skulls
for the skull throne! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The enemy's gate is
sideways!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a soundless impact as a sleep spell wasted itself
against Neville's shield. If there'd been other spells fired, they
hadn't hit.</p>
<p>Neville saw the brief look of fear on Wayne Hopkins's face, as
he stood besides two Gryffindors Neville didn't recognize, and then
-</p>
<p>- Neville dropped the Simple Shield and fired at Wayne -</p>
<p>- missed -</p>
<p>- his racing legs went <i>straight</i> past the enemy grouping
and toward another three Dragons, their wands coming up on him,
their mouths opening -</p>
<p>- not even thinking about it, Neville dived down to the forest
floor just as three voices cried "<i>Somnium!</i>"</p>
<p>It hurt, hard stones and hard twigs digging into Neville as he
rolled, it wasn't as bad as falling off his broomstick but he'd
still hit the ground pretty hard, and then Neville, with sudden
insight, lay still and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>"Stop that!" screamed a voice. "Don't shoot us, we're
Dragons!"</p>
<p>With a flash of glorious satisfaction, Neville realized that
he'd managed to get between two groups of Dragons just as one group
had fired on him. Harry had talked about this as a tactic for
making the enemy afraid to fire, but apparently it worked a bit
better than that.</p>
<p>And not only that, the Dragons believed they'd <i>gotten</i>
him, since they'd seen Neville fall just as they fired.</p>
<p>Neville counted to twenty inside his head, then opened his eyes
a crack.</p>
<p>The three Dragons were very near him, heads spinning rapidly as
cries of "<i>Somnium!</i>" and <i>"Skulls for the skull
throne!</i>" filled the air around them. All three had Simple
Shields up now.</p>
<p>Neville's wand was still in his hand, and it didn't take much
effort to point it at one boy's boots and whisper
"<i>Somnium.</i>"</p>
<p>Neville quickly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand as he heard
the boy fall to the ground.</p>
<p>"<i>Where'd it come from?</i>" screamed Justin
Finch-Fletchley's voice, and Neville heard rustles on the leafy
forest floor, as of two Dragons spinning around looking for an
enemy.</p>
<p>"<i>Reform ranks!</i>" bellowed Malfoy's voice. "<i>To me,
everyone, don't let them scatter you!</i>"</p>
<p>Neville's ears heard the two Dragons actually jump over his
prone body as they ran off.</p>
<p>Neville opened his eyes, pushed himself to his feet a bit
painfully, and then pointed his wand and said the new charm that
General Potter had taught them all. They couldn't do real illusion
spells to confuse the enemy, but even at their age they could -</p>
<p>"<i>Ventriliquo,</i>" whispered Neville, pointing the wand to
one side of Justin and the other boy, and then yelled, "<i>For
Cthulhu and glory!</i>"</p>
<p>Justin and the other boy stopped abruptly, turning their shields
toward where Neville had moved his battlecry, and that was when
multiple cries of "<i>Somnium!</i>" filled the air and the other
boy dropped before Neville was finished aiming.</p>
<p>"<i>The last one's mine!</i>" yelled Neville, and then he
started sprinting straight toward Justin, who'd been mean to him
until the older Hufflepuffs straightened him out. Neville was
surrounded by his comrades and <i>that</i> meant -</p>
<p>"<i>Special attack, Chaotic Leap!</i>" howled Neville as he
ran, and felt his body lighten, then lighten twice again, as his
comrades got their wands turned toward him and quietly cast the
Hover Charm, and Neville raised his left hand and snapped his
fingers and then used his legs to push off the ground as hard as he
could and <i>soared</i> through the air. Sheer shock painted
Justin's face as Neville went <i>over</i> the other boy's shield
and pointed his wand down at the form passing beneath him and cried
"<i>Somnium!</i>"</p>
<p>Because he'd felt like it, that was why.</p>
<p>Neville didn't quite get his feet turned around properly and
rather plowed into the ground as he landed, but two out of three of
the other Chaos Legionnaires had managed to hold their wands on him
throughout and he didn't hit very hard.</p>
<p>And Neville got to his feet, panting. He knew he should be
moving, people were yelling "Somnium!" all over the place -</p>
<p>"<i>I am Neville, the last scion of Longbottom!</i>" screamed
Neville to the sky above, holding his wand pointed straight up as
though to challenge the blazing blue heaven itself, knowing that
nothing after this day would ever be the same again. "<i>Neville of
Chaos! Face me if you da-</i>"</p>
<p>(When Neville woke up afterward, he was told that Dragon Army
had taken this as their cue to counterattack.)</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The girl beside Harry slumped to the ground, taking the shot
meant for him, and he could hear Mr. Goyle's distant gloating laugh
as his broomstick blasted past them, cutting the air so hard it
should have shattered in his wake.</p>
<p>"<i>Luminos!</i>" cried one of the boys next to Harry, who
hadn't been able to rebuild the magical strength fast enough to do
it earlier, and Mr. Goyle dodged it without a pause.</p>
<p>Chaos had only six soldiers left, now, and Dragon Army had two,
and the only problem was that one of those soldiers was invincible,
and the other one was using up three soldiers just to cover him
inside his shield.</p>
<p>They'd lost more soldiers to Mr. Goyle than all the other
Dragons put together, he was weaving and dodging through the air so
fast that no one could hit him, and he could <i>shoot people while
he did that.</i></p>
<p>Harry had thought of all sorts of ways to stop Mr. Goyle but
none of them were <i>safe</i>, even using the Hover Charm to slow
him down (it was a continuous beam and much easier to aim) wouldn't
be safe because he might fall off the broomstick, throwing things
in his way wouldn't be safe, and that was getting harder and harder
to remember as Harry's blood froze over.</p>
<p><i>It's a game. You're not trying to</i> kill <i>him. Don't
throw away all your future plans for a game...</i></p>
<p>Harry could <i>see</i> the pattern, he could <i>see</i> how Mr.
Goyle was weaving, he could <i>see</i> how and when they all needed
to fire in order to create a web of shots that Mr. Goyle wouldn't
be able to dodge, but he just hadn't been able to <i>explain</i> it
fast enough to his soldiers, they couldn't coordinate their shots
well enough, and now they didn't have enough people left to do it
-</p>
<p><i>I refuse to lose, not like this, not my whole army to one
soldier!</i></p>
<p>Mr. Goyle's broomstick turned faster than anything should have
been able to turn and started to angle in toward Harry and his
surviving troops, he could sense the boy beside him tensing,
getting ready to throw himself in front of his general.</p>
<p><i>SCREW THIS.</i></p>
<p>Harry's wand came up, focusing on Mr. Goyle, Harry's mind
visualized the pattern, and Harry's lips opened and his voice
screamed -</p>
<p>
"<i>Luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>luminos</i><i>-"<br />
</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Harry's eyes opened again, he found himself resting in a
comfortable position with his hands folded over his chest, holding
his wand like a fallen hero.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry sat up. His <i>magic</i> was aching, a strange
sensation but not an entirely unpleasant one, much like the burn
and lethargy that followed hard physical exercise.</p>
<p>"The general's awake!" cried a voice, and Harry blinked and
focused in that direction.</p>
<p>Four of his soldiers held their wands on a shimmering prismatic
hemisphere, and Harry realized that the battle wasn't over.
Right... he hadn't been hit by a Sleep Hex, just exhausted himself,
so when he woke up, he was still in the game.</p>
<p>Harry suspected he was going to get a lecture from
someone-or-other about not exhausting his magic to the point of
unconsciousness over a children's game. But he hadn't hurt Mr.
Goyle when he'd lost his temper, and that was the important
thing.</p>
<p>Then Harry's mind clicked on another implication, and he looked
down at the steel ring on his left hand's pinky finger, and almost
swore out loud when he saw that the tiny diamond was missing and
there was a marshmallow lying on the ground near where he'd
fallen.</p>
<p>He'd sustained that Transfiguration for seventeen days, and
would now need to start over.</p>
<p>Could've been worse. He could've done this fourteen days later,
<i>after</i> Professor McGonagall had approved him to Transfigure
his father's rock. That was one very good lesson to learn the easy
way.</p>
<p><i>Note to self: Always remove ring from finger before
completely exhausting magic.</i></p>
<p>Harry pushed himself up, making rather hard going of it. Using
up your magic didn't exhaust your muscles, but dodging around trees
certainly did.</p>
<p>He staggered over to the iridescent hemisphere that contained
Draco Malfoy, who was holding his wand aloft to sustain the shield,
and smiling coldly at Harry.</p>
<p>"Where's the fifth soldier?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Um..." said a boy whose name Harry couldn't remember at the
moment. "I fired a Sleep Hex at the shield and it bounced off and
hit Lavender, I mean the angle shouldn't have been right but it
did..."</p>
<p>Draco was smirking inside the shield.</p>
<p>"So let me guess," Harry said, looking Draco directly in the
eyes, "those neat little trios are the formation used by
professional magical militaries? Made up of trained soldiers who
can easily hit moving targets if their own hands are steady, and
who can combine their defensive powers so long as they stay
together? Unlike <i>your</i> soldiers?"</p>
<p>The smirk had vanished from Draco's face, which was now hard and
grim.</p>
<p>"You know," Harry said lightly, knowing that none of the others
would understand the real message passing between them, "it just
goes to show that you should always question everything you see
your role models doing, and ask why it's being done, and whether it
makes sense in context for you to do it too. Don't forget to apply
that advice to real life, by the way. And thanks for the
slow-moving clustered targets."</p>
<p>Because Draco had already gotten that lecture, and, Harry
suspected, discounted it out of suspicion that Harry was trying to
shift his loyalties further away from pureblood tradition. Which of
course Harry <i>was.</i> But this example would make an excellent
excuse, next Saturday, to claim that questioning authority was a
merely practical technique for real life. And Harry would also
mention the experiments he'd run, first with individuals and then
with groups, to check that his ideas about the importance of speed
had actually been <i>correct,</i> by way of hammering home the
point of Draco needing to keep an eye out at all times for chances
to apply the methods in everyday practice.</p>
<p>"You haven't won <i>yet,</i> General Potter!" snarled Draco.
"Maybe we'll run out of time, and Professor Quirrell will call it a
draw."</p>
<p>A fair and worrisome point. The war only ended when Professor
Quirrell, in his personal judgment, decided one army had won by
practical real-world standards. There was no <i>formal</i> victory
condition, Professor Quirrell had explained, because then Harry
would figure out how to game the rules. Harry had to admit this was
a fair cop.</p>
<p>And Harry couldn't blame Professor Quirrell for not calling an
end, because it was plausible that the last soldier of Dragon Army
could take out all five survivors of the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "Does anyone know anything about
General Malfoy's shield spell?"</p>
<p>It developed that Draco's shield was a version of the standard
<i>Protego</i> which had several disadvantages, the most important
of which was that the shield couldn't move with the caster.</p>
<p>The upside - or from Harry's perspective, downside - was that it
was easier to learn, easier to cast, and much easier to sustain for
long times.</p>
<p>They would need to hammer the shield with attack spells in order
to bring it down.</p>
<p>And Draco could apparently exert some control over the angle of
reflection at which the spells would bounce off.</p>
<p>The thought occurred to Harry that they could use Wingardium
Leviosa to pile up heavy rocks on the shield until Draco couldn't
sustain it against the pressure... but then the rocks might fall in
afterward and hit Draco, and injuring the enemy general for real
was not among today's goals.</p>
<p>"So," said Harry. "Are there such things as specialized
shield-piercing spells?"</p>
<p>There were.</p>
<p>Harry asked if any of his soldiers knew them.</p>
<p>No one did.</p>
<p>Draco was smirking again, inside his shield.</p>
<p>Harry asked if there was any sort of attack spell that
<i>wouldn't</i> bounce.</p>
<p>Lightning bolts, it seemed, were usually absorbed by shields
instead of bouncing off them.</p>
<p>...No one knew how to cast any sort of lightning-related
spell.</p>
<p>Draco sniggered.</p>
<p>Harry sighed.</p>
<p>He quite deliberately laid his wand on the ground.</p>
<p>And Harry announced, with some weariness in his voice, that he
would just go ahead and take down the shield himself, using some
method that would remain mysterious; and everyone else was to fire
on Draco as soon as his shield went down.</p>
<p>The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous.</p>
<p>Draco looked calm, which was to say, controlled.</p>
<p>A thin, folded blanket came out of Harry's pouch.</p>
<p>Harry sat down next to the shimmering shield, and pulled the
blanket over his head so no one could see what he did - except
Draco, of course.</p>
<p>From Harry's pouch came a car battery and a set of jumper
cables.</p>
<p>...it wasn't like he'd been about to leave the Muggle world to
start a new era of magical research, and not take along any way of
generating electricity.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the Chaos Legionnaires heard the sound of fingers
snapping, followed by a crackling noise from beneath the blanket.
The shield started glowing more brightly, and Harry's voice said,
"Don't be distracted please, eyes on General Malfoy."</p>
<p>The strain was showing on Draco's face, along with the fury and
annoyance and frustration.</p>
<p>Harry smiled up at him, and mouthed, <i>Tell you later.</i></p>
<p>And that was when a spiral of green energy shot out of the
forest and smashed into Draco's shield, which shrieked like pieces
of sharp glass being rubbed together, and Draco staggered.</p>
<p>In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took the jumper cables off the
battery and fed them into the pouch, then he fed the battery itself
into the pouch, and then he tore off the blanket and grabbed his
wand and stood up.</p>
<p>All of his soldiers were still there and glancing around
frantically.</p>
<p>"<i>Contego,</i>" Harry said, and his soldiers followed suit,
but Harry didn't even know which direction the shield ought to be
pointing in. "Did anyone see where that came from?" Shaken heads.
"And General Malfoy, would you mind telling me if <i>you</i> got
General Granger?"</p>
<p>"Why yes," Draco said acidly, "I mind."</p>
<p><i>Oh, hell.</i></p>
<p>Harry's mind began calculating, Draco inside the shield, Draco
worn out now to some degree, Harry worn out too, Hermione in the
woods who-knew-where, Harry and four other Chaotics left...</p>
<p>"You know, General Granger," Harry said out loud, "you really
should've waited to attack until after I'd fought General Malfoy.
You might've been able to get <i>all</i> the survivors."</p>
<p>From somewhere came a girl's high-pitched laughter.</p>
<p>Harry froze.</p>
<p><i>That wasn't Hermione.</i></p>
<p>And that was when the dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began to
rise, coming from all around them.</p>
<p>"<i>Don't be frightened, don't be sad,<br />
We'll only hurt you if you're bad...</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Granger cheated!</i>" burst out Draco inside the shield.
"She woke up her soldiers! Why doesn't Professor Quirrell -"</p>
<p>"Let me guess," Harry said, the sickness already churning in his
stomach. He really hated losing. "It was a very easy battle, right?
They dropped like flies?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Draco said. "We got them all on the first shot -"</p>
<p>The look of horrified realization spread from Draco to the Chaos
Legionnaires.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, "we didn't."</p>
<p>Camouflaged forms were appearing from among the trees.</p>
<p>"Allies?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"Allies," Draco said.</p>
<p>"Good," said General Granger's voice, and a spiral of green
energy blazed out of the woods and shattered Draco's shield to
splinters.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>General Granger surveyed the battlefield with a definite feeling
of satisfaction. She was down to nine Sunshine Soldiers, but that
was probably enough to handle the last survivor of the enemy
forces, especially when Parvati and Anthony and Ernie were already
holding their wands on General Potter, whom she'd ordered taken
alive (well, conscious).</p>
<p>It was Bad, she knew, but she'd really really <i>really</i>
wanted to gloat.</p>
<p>"There's a trick, isn't there?" said Harry, the strain showing
in his voice. "There <i>has</i> to be some trick. You can't just
turn into a perfect general. Not on top of everything else. You're
not that Slytherin! You don't write creepy poetry! <i>No one's that
good at everything!</i>"</p>
<p>General Granger glanced around at her Sunshine Soldiers, and
then looked back at Harry. Everyone was probably watching this on
the screens outside.</p>
<p>And General Granger said, "I can do anything if I study hard
enough."</p>
<p>"Oh now that's just bu-"</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry slumped to the ground in mid-sentence.</p>
<p>"SUNSHINE WINS," intoned the huge voice of Professor Quirrell,
seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>"Niceness has triumphed!" cried General Granger.</p>
<p>"<i>Hooray!</i>" shouted the Sunshine Soldiers. Even the
Gryffindor boys said it, and they said it with pride.</p>
<p>"And what's the moral of today's battle?" said General
Granger.</p>
<p>"<i>We can do anything if we study hard enough!</i>"</p>
<p>And the survivors of the Sunshine Regiment marched off toward
the victory field, singing their marching song as they went:</p>
<p><i>Don't be frightened, don't be sad,<br />
We'll only hurt you if you're bad,<br />
And send you to a home that's true,<br />
With new friends to watch over you,<br />
Be sure to tell them you were sent<br />
By Granger's Sunshine Regiment!</i></p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="31">Chapter 31</h2><h3>Working in Groups, Pt
2</h3>
<p><i>Aftermaths:</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry paced backward and forward in his general's office, which
made a wonderful room for pacing, it didn't have any other uses as
far as he could tell.</p>
<p><i>How?</i></p>
<p><i>How?</i></p>
<p>Hermione shouldn't have won that battle! Not on her first try,
not when she wasn't at all violent by her nature, automatically
being a great military commander on top of everything else was too
much even for <i>her</i>.</p>
<p>Had she read about the tactic in a military history book? But it
hadn't been just that one tactic, she'd had her forces perfectly
positioned to block any retreat, her troops had been better
coordinated than his <i>or</i> Draco's...</p>
<p>Had Professor Quirrell broken his promise not to help her? Had
he given her the diary of General Tacticus or something?</p>
<p>Harry was missing something here, something really important,
and his mind went around and around in circles, and he still
couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>Finally Harry sighed. He wasn't getting anywhere on this, and he
had to go learn the Breaking Drill Hex from Hermione or someone
before the next battle - Professor Quirrell had explained to Harry,
his voice amused but with a sharp undertone of warning, that "no
magical items except the ones I give you" included Muggle
technology no matter how much that <i>wasn't magic.</i> Plus Harry
also needed to figure out how to bring down Mr. Goyle next
time...</p>
<p>Battles counted for a lot of Quirrell points if you were a
general, and Harry needed to get cracking if he wanted to win
Professor Quirrell's Christmas wish.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In his private room at Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared off into
space, as though the wall in front of his desk was the most
fascinating surface in the world.</p>
<p><i>How?</i></p>
<p><i>How?</i></p>
<p>In retrospect it had been an obvious sort of idea as cunning
plots went, but Granger wasn't <i>supposed</i> to be cunning! She'd
been too much of a Hufflepuff to use a Simple Strike Hex! Had
Professor Quirrell been advising her despite his promise, or...</p>
<p>And then Draco finally did what he should have done much
earlier.</p>
<p>What he should have done after the first time he met with
Granger.</p>
<p>What Harry Potter had <i>told</i> him to do, <i>trained</i> him
to do, and yet Harry had also warned Draco that it would take time
to make his brain realize that the methods applied to real life,
and Draco hadn't <i>understood</i> that until today. He could have
avoided every single one of his mistakes if he'd just
<i>applied</i> the things Harry had already <i>told</i> him -</p>
<p>Draco said out loud, "I notice that I am confused."</p>
<p><i>Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more
confused by fiction than by reality...</i></p>
<p>Draco was confused.</p>
<p>Therefore, something he believed was fiction.</p>
<p>Granger should not have been able to do all that.</p>
<p>Therefore, she probably hadn't.</p>
<p><i>I promise not to help General Granger in any way that the two
of you don't know about.</i></p>
<p>With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers out of the
way, hunting through the mess on his desk, until he found it.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>Right in the list of people and equipment assigned to each of
the three armies.</p>
<p><i>Curse</i> Professor Quirrell!</p>
<p>Draco had <i>read</i> it and he still hadn't <i>seen</i> it
-</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The afternoon sunlight poured down into the office of the
Sunshine Regiment, illuminating General Granger in her chair as
though she glowed with a golden aura.</p>
<p>"How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?"
said General Granger.</p>
<p>"Not long," said Colonel Blaise Zabini. "He may have already.
How long will it take Potter to figure it out?"</p>
<p>"Forever," said General Granger, "unless Malfoy tells him, or
one of his own soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn't think
like that."</p>
<p>"Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of
the corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain
Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy
had left, of course.) "I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who
would try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?"</p>
<p>"Harry," said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said,
"Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Malfoy thinks he's way better than everyone else," said
Zabini.</p>
<p>"And Harry... doesn't really <i>see</i> most other people like
that," said Hermione.</p>
<p>It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very
alone. It wasn't that he went around thinking in words that only
geniuses had a right to exist. It just wouldn't <i>occur</i> to him
that anyone in Hermione's army besides Hermione could have any good
ideas.</p>
<p>"Anyhow," Hermione said. "Captains Goldstein and Weasley, you're
on duty for thinking up strategic ideas for our next battle.
Captains Macmillan and Susan - sorry, I mean Macmillan and Bones -
try to come up with some tactics we can use, also any training you
think we should try. Oh, and congratulations on your marching song,
Captain Goldstein, I think it was a big plus for <i>esprit de
corps</i>."</p>
<p>"What're you doing?" said Susan. "And Colonel Zabini?"</p>
<p>Hermione stood up out of her chair, stretching. "I'll try to
figure out what Harry Potter is thinking and Colonel Zabini will
try to figure out what Draco Malfoy might do, and both of us will
join you again after we come up with something. I'm going to walk
while I think. Zabini, you want to come along?"</p>
<p>"Yes, General," said Zabini stiffly.</p>
<p>It hadn't been meant as an order. Hermione sighed to herself a
little. This was going to take some getting used to, and although
Zabini's first idea had certainly worked, she wasn't <i>quite</i>
sure that Professor Quirrell's quote mixture of positive and
negative incentives unquote would be enough to keep the Slytherin
fully on her side until December when traitors would be allowed for
the first time...</p>
<p>She still had no idea what she was going to do with Professor
Quirrell's Christmas wish, either. Maybe she'd just ask Mandy if
she wanted anything, when the time came around.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="32">Chapter 32</h2><h3>Interlude: Personal Financial
Management</h3>
<p>"But Headmaster," Harry argued, some of his desperation leaking
into his voice, "leaving all of my assets in one undiversified
vault full of gold coins - it's crazy, Headmaster! It's like, I
don't know, doing Transfiguration experiments without consulting a
recognized authority! You just don't do that with money!"</p>
<p>From the lined face of the old wizard - underneath a festive
holiday hat like a catastrophic automobile collision between cars
of green and red cloth - a grave, sad look peered out at Harry.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Harry," said Dumbledore, "and I do apologize, but
allowing you control over your own finances would give you far too
much independence of action."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened and no sound came out. He was, literally,
speechless.</p>
<p>"I will permit you to withdraw five Galleons for Christmas
presents," said Dumbledore, "which is more than any boy your age
should spend, but poses no threat, I think -"</p>
<p>"<i>I can't believe you just said that!</i>" the words burst
out of Harry's mouth. "You <i>admit</i> to being that
manipulative?"</p>
<p>"Manipulative?" said the old wizard, smiling slightly. "No,
manipulative would be if I did <i>not</i> admit it, or if I had
some deeper motive behind the obvious. This is quite
straightforward, Harry. You are not yet ready to play the game, and
it would be foolish to allow you thousands of Galleons with which
to upset the gameboard."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The bright hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley had increased by a
hundredfold and redoubled as Christmas approached, with all the
shops enshrouded in brilliant sorceries that flashed and sparkled
as though the season's spirit was about to blaze out of control and
turn the whole area into a cheerful holiday crater. The streets
were so crowded with witches and wizards in festive and <i>loud</i>
clothing that your eyes were assaulted almost as severely as your
ears; and it was clear, from the bewildering variety of the
shoppers, that Diagon Alley was considered an international
attraction. There were witches wrapped in giant swathes of cloth
like toweled mummies, and wizards in formal top hats and
bath-robes, and young children barely past toddling age who were
decorated with lights that blazed almost as bright as the shops
themselves, as their parents took them hand in hand through that
magic wonderland and let them shriek to their heart's content. It
was the season to be merry.</p>
<p>And in the midst of all that light and cheer, a note of blackest
night; a cold, dark atmosphere that cleared a few precious paces of
distance even in the midst of all that crush.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, with a look of grim revulsion,
like he'd just bitten into food that not only tasted horrible but
was morally repugnant to boot. It was the sort of grim face an
ordinary person might make after biting into a meat pie, and
discovering that it was rotten and had been made from kittens.</p>
<p>"Oh, come <i>on</i>," Harry said. "You must have <i>some</i>
ideas."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said, his lips set in a thin
line, "I agreed to act as your adult guardian on this expedition. I
did not agree to advise you on your choice of presents. I don't do
Christmas, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"How about Newtonmas?" Harry said brightly. "Isaac Newton
actually <i>was</i> born on December 25th, unlike some other
historical figures I could name."</p>
<p>This failed to impress Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Look," said Harry, "I'm sorry, but I've got to do
<i>something</i> special for Fred and George and I've got no idea
of my options."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a thoughtful humming sound. "You could
ask which family members they most dislike, and then hire an
assassin. I know someone from a certain government-in-exile who is
quite competent, and he would give you a discount on multiple
Weasleys."</p>
<p>"<i>This</i> Christmas," Harry said, dropping his voice into a
lower register, "give your friends the gift... of
<i>death</i>."</p>
<p>That made Professor Quirrell smile. It went all the way to his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "at least you didn't suggest getting them a
pet rat -" Harry's mouth snapped shut, and he was regretting the
words almost as soon as they were out of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Harry said at once, "long dumb story." And telling it
seemed wrong somehow, maybe because Harry was afraid Professor
Quirrell would have laughed even if Bill Weasley <i>hadn't</i> been
cured and everything put back to right...</p>
<p>And where had Professor Quirrell <i>been</i> that he'd never
heard the story? Harry had gotten the impression that everyone in
magical Britain knew.</p>
<p>"Look," said Harry, "I'm trying to <i>solidify their loyalty to
me,</i> you know? Make the Weasley twins my minions? Like the old
saying goes: A friend isn't someone you use once and then throw
away, a friend is someone you use over and over again. Fred and
George are two of the most useful friends I have in Hogwarts,
Professor Quirrell, and I plan to use them over and over again. So
if you'd help me be Slytherin here, and suggest something they
might be <i>very</i> grateful for..." Harry's voice trailed off
invitingly.</p>
<p>You just had to pitch these things the right way.</p>
<p>They walked on for a good way before Professor Quirrell spoke
again, his voice practically dripping with distaste. "The Weasley
twins are using secondhand wands, Mr. Potter. They would be
reminded of your generosity with every Charm they cast."</p>
<p>Harry clapped his hands together in involuntary excitement. Just
put the money on account at Ollivander's, and tell Mr. Ollivander
to never refund it - no, better yet, to send it to Lucius Malfoy if
the Weasley twins didn't show up before the start of their next
school year. "That's <i>brilliant</i>, Professor!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell did not look like he appreciated the
compliment. "I suppose I can tolerate Christmas in <i>that</i>
spirit, Mr. Potter, though only barely." Then he smiled slightly.
"Of course that will cost you fourteen Galleons, and you only have
five."</p>
<p>"<i>Five</i> Galleons," Harry said, with a sniff of outrage.
"Just who does the Headmaster think he's dealing with, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I think," said Professor Quirrell, "that it simply did not
occur to him to fear the consequences if you turned your ingenuity
to the task of obtaining funds. Though you were wise to lose,
rather than making it an explicit threat. Out of curiosity, Mr.
Potter, what <i>would</i> you have done if I hadn't turned away in
boredom while you, in a fit of childish pique, counted out five
Galleons worth of Knuts?"</p>
<p>"Well, the easiest way would've been to borrow money from Draco
Malfoy," said Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell chuckled briefly. "Seriously, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p><i>Duly noted.</i> "Probably I'd have done a few celebrity
appearances. I wouldn't resort to anything economically disruptive
just for spending money." Harry had checked, and he <i>would</i> be
allowed to keep the Time-Turner while he went home for the
holidays, so that his sleep cycle didn't start to rotate. But then
it was <i>also</i> possible that someone kept an eye out for
magical day traders. The gold and silver trick would've taken work
on the Muggle end, and seed funding, and the goblins might've
gotten suspicious after the first cycle. And starting a real bank
would be a <i>lot</i> of work... Harry hadn't <i>quite</i> worked
out any money-making methods that were fast <i>and</i> certain
<i>and</i> safe, so he'd been very glad when Professor Quirrell had
turned out to be so easily fooled.</p>
<p>"I do hope those five Galleons will be enough to last, since you
counted them so carefully," said Professor Quirrell. "I doubt the
Headmaster shall be so eager to entrust me with your vault key a
second time, once he discovers I've been tricked."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you did your best," Harry said with deep
gratitude.</p>
<p>"Do you need any assistance finding a safe place to store all
those Knuts, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Well, sort of," said Harry. "Do you know of any good investment
opportunities, Professor Quirrell?"</p>
<p>And the two of them walked on, in their tiny sphere of silence
and isolation, through the brilliant and bustling crowds; and if
you looked carefully, you would see that where they went, leafy
boughs faded, and flowers withered, and children's toys that played
cheerful bells changed to lower and more ominous notes.</p>
<p>Harry <i>did</i> notice, but he didn't say anything, just smiled
a little to himself.</p>
<p>Everyone had their own way of celebrating the holidays, and the
Grinch was as much a part of Christmas as Santa.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled
out of control.</p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said, not even trying to keep the worry out of
her voice as the two of them entered the Great Hall, "something has
to be done."</p>
<p>The atmosphere at Hogwarts before Yuletide was usually bright
and cheerful. The Great Hall had already been decorated in green
and red, after a Slytherin and a Gryffindor whose Yule wedding had
become a symbol of friendship transcending Houses and allegiances,
a tradition almost as ancient as Hogwarts itself and which had even
spread to Muggle countries.</p>
<p>Now the students eating dinner were glancing nervously over
their shoulders, or sending vicious glares at other tables, or at
some tables arguing heatedly. You could have described the
atmosphere as <i>tense,</i> perhaps, but the phrase coming to
Minerva's mind was <i>fifth degree of caution.</i></p>
<p>Take a school, into four Houses divided...</p>
<p>Now into each year, add three armies at war.</p>
<p>And the partisanship of Dragon and Sunshine and Chaos had spread
beyond the first-years; they had become the armies for those who
had no armies. Students were wearing armbands with insignia of fire
or smile or upraised hand, and hexing each other in the corridors.
All three first-year generals had told them to stop - even Draco
Malfoy had heard her out and then nodded grimly - but their
supposed followers hadn't listened.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gazed out at the tables with a distant look. "<i>In
every city,</i>" the old wizard quoted softly,"<i>the population
has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green
factions...</i> <i>And they fight against their opponents knowing
not for what end they imperil themselves...</i> <i>So there grows
up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause,
and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place
neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of
friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ
with respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin. I, for
my part, am unable to call this anything except a disease of the
soul...</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Minerva, "I don't -"</p>
<p>"Procopius," said Dumbledore. "They took their chariot-racing
very seriously, in the Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree that
something must be done."</p>
<p>"Soon," Minerva said, her voice lowering even further. "Albus, I
think it must be done before Saturday."</p>
<p>On Sunday, most students would leave Hogwarts to stay the
holiday with their families; Saturday, then, was the final battle
of the three first-year armies that would determine the awarding of
Professor Quirrell's thrice-cursed Christmas wish.</p>
<p>Dumbledore glanced over at her, studying her gravely. "You fear
that the explosion will come then, and someone will be hurt."</p>
<p>Minerva nodded.</p>
<p>"And that Professor Quirrell will be blamed."</p>
<p>Minerva nodded again, her face tight. She had long since become
wise in the ways that Defense Professors were fired. "Albus,"
Minerva said, "we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, we
<i>cannot!</i> If he but stays through January our fifth-years will
pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years will
pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months, a
whole generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite of
the Dark Lord's curse - you must stop the battle, Albus! Ban the
armies now!"</p>
<p>"I am not sure the Defense Professor would take that kindly,"
said Dumbledore, glancing over toward the Head Table where Quirrell
was drooling into his soup. "He did seem most attached to his
armies, though when I agreed I thought there would be four in each
year." The old wizard sighed. "A clever man, probably with the best
of intentions; but perhaps not clever enough, I fear. And to ban
the armies might also trigger the explosion."</p>
<p>"But then Albus, what will you <i>do?</i>"</p>
<p>The old wizard favored her with a benign smile. "Why, I shall
plot, of course. It's the new fashion in Hogwarts."</p>
<p>And they had come too close to the Head Table for Minerva to say
anything more.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled
out of control.</p>
<p>The first battle in December had been... messy, or so Draco had
heard.</p>
<p>The second battle had been <i>deranged</i>.</p>
<p>And the next one would be <i>worse</i>, unless the three of them
together succeeded in their last desperate attempt to stop it.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell, this is insanity," Draco said flatly. "This
isn't Slytherin any more, it's just..<i>.</i>" Draco was at a loss
for words. He waved his hands helplessly. "You can't possibly do
any real plots with all this stuff going on. Last battle, one of my
soldiers faked his own suicide. We have <i>Hufflepuffs</i> trying
to plot, and they think they can, but they <i>can't.</i> Things
just happen at random now, it doesn't have anything to do with
who's cleverest, or which army fights best, it's..." He couldn't
even describe it.</p>
<p>"I agree with Mr. Malfoy," said Granger in the tones of someone
who hadn't ever expected to hear herself saying those words.
"Allowing traitors isn't working, Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>Draco had tried forbidding anyone in his army to plot except
him, and that had just driven the plots underground, no one wanted
to be left out when the soldiers in <i>other</i> armies got to
plot. After miserably losing their last battle, he'd finally given
in and revoked his decree; but by then his soldiers had already
started setting their own personal plans in motion, without any
sort of central coordination.</p>
<p>After being told all the plans, or what his soldiers claimed
were their plans, Draco had tried to sketch a plot to win the final
battle. It had required considerably more than three different
things to go right, and Draco had used <i>Incendio</i> on the paper
and <i>Everto</i> to vanish the ashes, because if Father had seen
it he would have been disowned.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyelids were half-closed, his chin resting
on his hands as he leaned forward onto his desk. "And you, Mr.
Potter?" said the Defense Professor. "Are you likewise in
agreement?"</p>
<p>"All we'd need to do is shoot Franz Ferdinand and we could start
World War One," said Harry. "It's gone to complete chaos. I'm all
for it."</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" said Draco in utter shock.</p>
<p>He didn't even realize until a second later that he'd said it at
exactly the same time, and in exactly the same tone of indignation,
as Granger.</p>
<p>Granger shot him a startled glance, and Draco carefully kept his
face neutral. Oops.</p>
<p>"That's right!" said Harry. "I'm betraying you! Both of you!
Again! Ha ha!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly, though his eyes were
still half-closed. "And why is that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Because I think I can cope with the chaos better than Miss
Granger or Mr. Malfoy," said the traitor. "Our war is a zero-sum
game, and it doesn't matter whether it's easy or hard in an
absolute sense, only who does better or worse."</p>
<p>Harry Potter was learning far too fast.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes moved beneath their lids to regard
Draco, and then Granger. "In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I
simply could not live with myself if I shut down the grand debacle
before its climax. One of your soldiers has even become a quadruple
agent."</p>
<p>"<i>Quadruple?</i>" said Granger. "But there's only three sides
in the war!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor Quirrell, "you'd think that, wouldn't you.
I am not sure that there has ever in history been a quadruple
agent, or any army with such a high fraction of real and pretended
traitors. We are exploring new realms, Miss Granger, and we cannot
turn back now."</p>
<p>Draco left the Defense Professor's office with his teeth
gritting hard against each other, and Granger looking even more
annoyed beside him.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you did that, Harry!" said Granger.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said, not sounding sorry at all, his lips curved
up in a merry smile of evil. "Remember, Hermione, it <i>is</i> just
a game, and why should generals like us be the only ones who get to
plot? And besides, what are the two of you going to do about it?
Team up against me?"</p>
<p>Draco traded glances with Granger, knowing that his own face was
as tight as hers. Harry had been relying, more and more openly and
gloatingly, on Draco's refusal to make common cause with a mudblood
girl; and Draco was beginning to get <i>sick</i> of having that
used against him. If this kept up much longer he <i>was</i> going
to ally with Granger just to crush Harry Potter, and see how much
the son of a mudblood liked <i>that.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled
out of control.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling
utterly and completely helpless.</p>
<p>There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names,
and some of the lines were in different colors and...</p>
<p>"Tell me," said General Granger, "is there anyone in my army who
<i>isn't</i> a spy?"</p>
<p>The two of them weren't in the office but in another, deserted
classroom, and they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said,
it was now nearly certain that at least one of the captains was a
traitor. Probably Captain Goldstein, but Zabini didn't know for
sure.</p>
<p>Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin's
face. Blaise Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but
he didn't seem to actively dislike her; nothing like the derision
he held for Draco Malfoy, or the resentment he had developed for
Harry Potter. She had worried at first about Zabini betraying her,
but the boy seemed desperate to show that the other two generals
were no better than him; and Hermione thought that while Zabini
would probably be happy to sell her out to anyone <i>else</i>, he'd
never let Malfoy or Harry win.</p>
<p>"Most of your soldiers <i>are</i> still loyal to you, I'm pretty
sure," said Zabini. "It's just that no one wants to be left out of
the fun." The scornful look on the Slytherin's face made it clear
what he thought of people who didn't take plotting seriously. "So
they think they can be double agents and secretly work for our side
while pretending to betray us."</p>
<p>"And that would also go for anyone in the <i>other</i> armies
who says they want to be <i>our</i> spy," Hermione said
carefully.</p>
<p>The young Slytherin shrugged. "I think I did a good job of
telling which ones really want to sell out Malfoy, I'm not sure
<i>anyone</i> really wants to sell out Potter to you. But Nott is a
sure bet for betraying Potter to Malfoy and since I had Entwhistle
approach him supposedly on behalf of Malfoy and Entwhistle really
reports to us, that's almost as good -"</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. "We're going to lose,
aren't we?"</p>
<p>"Look," Zabini said patiently, "You're in the lead right now on
Quirrell points. We just have to not lose this last battle
<i>completely</i> and you'll have enough Quirrell points to win the
Christmas wish."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would
operate on a formal scoring system, which he'd been asked to do to
avoid recriminations afterward. Each time you shot someone, the
general of your army got two Quirrell points. A gong would ring
through the battle area (they didn't know yet where they would be
fighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest again, where
Sunshine did well) and its pitch would tell which army had won the
points. And if anyone was faking being hit, the gong would ring out
anyway, and then a double gong would ring later, after no fixed
time, to hail the retraction. And if you called the name of an
army, cried "For Sunshine!" or "For Chaos!" or "For Dragon!", it
switched your allegiance to that army...</p>
<p>Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in <i>that</i> set
of rules. But Professor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if
you'd been originally assigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you
in the name of Sunshine - or rather, they could, but then Sunshine
lost a single Quirrell point, symbolized by a triple gong. That
prevented you from shooting your own soldiers for points, and
discouraged suiciding before the enemy got you, but you could still
shoot spies if you had to.</p>
<p>Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrell
points, and Malfoy had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had two
hundred and twenty-one; and there were twenty-four soldiers in each
army.</p>
<p>"So we fight carefully," Hermione said, "and just try not to
lose too badly."</p>
<p>"No," said Zabini. The young Slytherin's face was now serious.
"The problem is, Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to
win is to combine and crush us, then fight it out on their own. So
here's what I think we should do -"</p>
<p>Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini's
plan hadn't been the obvious one, it had been strange and
complicated and layered and the sort of thing she would've expected
Harry to come up with, not Zabini. It felt wrong just for her to be
able to <i>understand</i> a plan like that. Young girls shouldn't
be able to understand plans like that. The Hat would've Sorted her
into Slytherin, if it'd seen that she could understand plans like
that...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The awesome thing was how fast he'd been able to escalate the
chaos once he started doing it deliberately.</p>
<p>Harry sat in his office; he'd been given the authority to order
furniture from the house elves, so he'd ordered a throne, and
curtains in a black and crimson pattern. Scarlet light like blood,
mixed with shadow, poured over the floor.</p>
<p>Something in Harry felt like he'd finally come home.</p>
<p>Before him stood the four Lieutenants of Chaos, his most trusted
minions, one of whom was a traitor.</p>
<p>This. This was what life should be like.</p>
<p>"We are gathered," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Let Chaos reign," chorused his four Lieutenants.</p>
<p>"My hovercraft is full of eels," said Harry.</p>
<p>"I will not buy this record, it is scratched," chorused his four
Lieutenants.</p>
<p>"All mimsy were the borogroves."</p>
<p>"And the mome raths outgrabe!"</p>
<p>That concluded the formalities.</p>
<p>"How goes the confusion?" Harry said in a dry whisper like
Emperor Palpatine.</p>
<p>"It goes well, General Chaos," said Neville in the tone he
always used for military matters, a tone so deep that the boy often
had to stop and cough. The Chaotic Lieutenant was neatly dressed in
his black school robes, trimmed in the yellow of Hufflepuff House,
and his hair was parted and combed in the usual look for an earnest
young boy. Harry had liked the incongruity better than any of the
cloaks they'd tried. "Our Legionnaires have begun five new plots
since yesterday evening."</p>
<p>Harry smiled evilly. "Do any of them have a chance of
working?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Neville of Chaos. "Here's the
report."</p>
<p>"Excellent," said Harry, and laughed chillingly as he took the
parchment from Neville's hand, trying his best to make it sound
like he was choking on dust. That brought the total to sixty.</p>
<p>Let Draco <i>try</i> to handle that. Let him <i>try</i>.</p>
<p>And as for Blaise Zabini...</p>
<p>Harry laughed again, and this time it didn't even take an effort
to sound evil. He really needed to borrow someone's pet Kneazle for
his staff meetings, so he'd have a cat to stroke while he did
this.</p>
<p>"Can the Legion stop making plots now?" said Finnigan of Chaos.
"I mean, don't we have enough already -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said flatly. "We can <i>never</i> have enough
plots."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had put it perfectly. They were pushing the
boundaries further, perhaps, than they had ever been pushed; and
Harry wouldn't have been able to live with himself if he'd turned
back now.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>
<p>"That will be the Dragon General," Harry said, smiling with evil
prescience. "He arrives precisely as I expected. Do show him in,
and yourselves out."</p>
<p>And the four Lieutenants of Chaos shuffled out, casting dark
looks at Draco as the enemy general entered into Harry's secret
lair.</p>
<p>If he wasn't allowed to do this when he was older, Harry was
just going to stay eleven forever.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of
blood dancing across the floor from behind Harry Potter's
grownup-sized cushioned chair, which he had covered in gold and
silver glitter and insisted on referring to as his throne.</p>
<p>(Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he'd done
the right thing in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he
could take over the world. Draco couldn't even <i>imagine</i> what
it would be like to live under his rule.)</p>
<p>"Good evening, Dragon General," said Harry Potter in a chill
whisper. "You have arrived just as I expected."</p>
<p>This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry had
agreed on the meeting time in advance.</p>
<p>And it also wasn't evening, but by now Draco knew better than to
say anything.</p>
<p>"General Potter," Draco said with as much dignity as he could
manage, "you know that our two armies have to work together for
<i>either</i> of us to win Professor Quirrell's wish, right?"</p>
<p>"Yesss," hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a
Parselmouth. "We must cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then
fight it out between us. But if one of us betrays the other earlier
on, that one could gain an advantage in the later fight. And the
Sunshine General, who knows all this, will try to trick each of us
into thinking the other has betrayed them. And you and I, who know
that, will be tempted to betray the other and pretend that it is
Granger's trickery. And Granger knows <i>that</i>, as well."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. That much was obvious. "And... both of us
<i>only</i> want to win, and there's no one else who'll punish
either of us if we defect..."</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious.
"We are faced with a <i>true</i> Prisoner's Dilemma."</p>
<p>The Prisoner's Dilemma, according to Harry's teachings, ran
thus: Two prisoners had been locked in separate cells. There was
evidence against each prisoner, but only minor evidence, enough for
a prison sentence of two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt to
<i>defect,</i> betray the other, testify against them in court; and
this would take one year off their own prison sentence, but add two
years to the other's. Or a prisoner could <i>cooperate,</i> staying
silent. So if both prisoners defected, each testifying against the
other, they would serve three years apiece; if both cooperated, or
stayed silent, they would serve two years each; but if one defected
and the other cooperated, the defector would serve a single year,
and the cooperator would serve four.</p>
<p>And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing
the other one's choice, and neither would be given a chance to
change their decision afterward.</p>
<p>Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death
Eaters during the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed
any traitors.</p>
<p>Harry had nodded and said that was <i>one</i> way to resolve the
Prisoner's Dilemma - and in fact both Death Eaters would
<i>want</i> there to be a Dark Lord for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>(Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this
for a while before they continued. It had explained a <i>lot</i>
about why Father and his friends had agreed to serve under a Dark
Lord who often wasn't nice to them...)</p>
<p>In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why
people had governments - <i>you</i> might be better off if you
stole from someone else, just like each prisoner would be
individually better off if they defected in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
But if <i>everyone</i> thought like that, the country would fall
into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen
if both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by
governments, just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled
by the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>(Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken for
granted that ambitious wizards put themselves in power because they
wanted to rule, and people let themselves be ruled because they
were scared little Hufflepuffs. And this, on reflection, still
seemed true; but Harry's perspective was fascinating even if it was
wrong.)</p>
<p>But, Harry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party
punishing you was not the <i>only</i> possible reason to cooperate
in the Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>
<p>Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a
magically produced identical copy of yourself.</p>
<p>Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither
Draco would want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to
mention that no Malfoy would let himself become known as a
traitor.</p>
<p>Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet
<i>another</i> solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma - people might
cooperate because they cared about each other, or because they had
senses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve their
reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to
construct a <i>true</i> Prisoner's Dilemma - in real life, people
usually cared about the other person, or their honor or their
reputation or a Dark Lord's punishment or <i>something</i> besides
the prison sentences. But suppose the copy had been of someone
<i>completely</i> selfish -</p>
<p>(Pansy Parkinson had been the example they'd used)</p>
<p>- so each Pansy only cared what happened to <i>her</i> and not
to the other Pansy.</p>
<p><i>Given</i> that this was all Pansy cared about... and that
there was no Dark Lord... and Pansy wasn't worried about her
reputation... and Pansy either had no sense of honor or didn't
consider herself obligated to the other prisoner... <i>then</i>
would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?</p>
<p>Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do
was for Pansy to defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone
named Douglas Hofstadter, thought these people were wrong. Because,
Harry had said, if Pansy defected - not at random, but for what
seemed to her like <i>rational reasons</i> - then the other Pansy
would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn't
decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in
which both Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies
defected, and she was better off if both copies cooperated. And if
Harry had thought 'rational' people <i>did</i> defect in the
Prisoner's Dilemma, then he wouldn't have done anything to spread
that kind of 'rationality', because a country or a conspiracy full
of 'rational' people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your
<i>enemies</i> about 'rationality'.</p>
<p>Which had all <i>sounded</i> reasonable at the time, but
<i>now</i> the thought was occurring to Draco that...</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> said," Draco said, "that the rational solution to
the Prisoner's Dilemma is to cooperate. But of course <i>you</i>
would want me to believe that, wouldn't you?" And if Draco was
fooled into cooperating, Harry would just say, <i>Ha ha, betrayed
you again!</i> and laugh at him about it afterward.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't fake your lessons," Harry said seriously. "But I
have to remind you, Draco, that I didn't say you should just
automatically cooperate. Not on a <i>true</i> Prisoner's Dilemma
like this one. What I said was that when you choose, you shouldn't
think like you're choosing for just yourself, <i>or</i> like you're
choosing for everyone. You should think like you're choosing for
all the people who are <i>similar enough</i> to you that they'll
probably do the same thing you do for the same reasons. And also
choosing the predictions made by anyone who knows you well enough
to predict you accurately, so that you never have to regret being
rational because of the correct predictions that other people make
about you - remind me to explain about Newcomb's Problem at some
point. So the question you and I have to ask, Draco, is this: are
we similar enough that we'll probably do the <i>same thing</i>
whatever it is, making our decisions in mostly the same way? Or do
we know each other well enough to predict each other, so that
<i>I</i> can predict whether you'll cooperate or defect, and
<i>you</i> can predict that I've decided to do the same thing I
predict you'll do, because <i>I</i> know that you can predict me
deciding that?"</p>
<p>...and Draco could not help but think that since he had to
strain just to understand <i>half</i> of that, the answer was
obviously 'No'.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"I see," said Harry, sounding disappointed. "Oh, well. I guess
we'll have to think of some other way, then."</p>
<p>Draco hadn't thought that was going to work.</p>
<p>Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both
agreed much earlier that what they did on the battlefield would
<i>not</i> count as broken promises in real life - though Draco was
a little angry about what Harry had done in Professor Quirrell's
office, and said so.</p>
<p>But if the two of them couldn't rely on honor or friendship,
that <i>did</i> leave the question of how to get their armies to
work together on beating Sunshine, despite everything Granger might
try to break them up. Professor Quirrell's rules didn't make it
tempting to let Sunshine kill the other army's soldiers - that just
increased the bar you had to pass yourself - but it did tempt each
side to steal kills instead of acting like a single army would, or
to shoot some of the other side's soldiers during the confusion of
battle...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione was walking back to Ravenclaw not really looking where
she was going, her mind preoccupied with war and treachery and
other age-inappropriate concepts, and she turned a corner and
bumped straight into a grownup.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said automatically, and then, entirely without
thinking, "<i>Eeeeek!</i>"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Miss Granger," said the cheerful smile, set
beneath the twinkling eyes, and above the silver beard, of the
HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS. "You are quite forgiven."</p>
<p>Her gaze was helplessly locked on the kindly face of the most
powerful wizard in the world, who was also the Chief Warlock, who
was also the Supreme Mugwump, who had gone insane years ago from
the stress of fighting the Dark Lord, and numerous other facts that
were popping up into her mind one after the other while her throat
went on making little embarrassing squeaks.</p>
<p>"In fact, Miss Granger," said Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, "it is quite lucky that we bumped into each other. Why,
I was just now wondering curiously what the three of you were
thinking of asking for your wishes..."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Saturday dawned bright and clear and with the students speaking
in hushed voices, as though the first to shout might set off the
explosion.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco had hoped that they would be fighting in the upper levels
of Hogwarts again. Professor Quirrell had said that real fights
were more likely to take place in cities than forests, and fighting
inside schoolrooms and corridors was supposed to simulate that,
with ribbons to mark the allowed areas. Dragon Army had done well
in those fights.</p>
<p>Instead, just as Draco had feared, Professor Quirrell had come
up with something <i>special</i> for this battle.</p>
<p>The battleground was the Hogwarts Lake.</p>
<p>And not in boats, either.</p>
<p>They were fighting <i>underwater</i>.</p>
<p>The Giant Squid had been temporarily paralyzed; spells had been
set in place to keep away the grindylows; Professor Quirrell had
gone and talked to the merfolk; and all the soldiers had been
issued <i>potions of underwater action</i> that allowed them to
breathe, see clearly, talk to each other, and swim not quite as
fast as a fast walk by kicking their legs.</p>
<p>A huge silver sphere hung in the center of the battleground,
shining like a small underwater moon. It would help to provide a
sense of direction - at first. The moon would slowly go into
eclipse as the battle went on, and when it had gone entirely dark,
the battle would end if it hadn't already.</p>
<p>War in water. You couldn't defend a perimeter, attackers could
come at you from any direction, and even with the potion you
couldn't see very far in the darkness of the lake.</p>
<p>And if you swam too far away from the action, you would start to
glow after a while, and be easy to hunt down - ordinarily if an
army scattered and ran instead of fighting, Professor Quirrell
would just declare them defeated; but today they were working on a
points system. Of course you still had some time <i>before</i> you
started to glow, if you wanted to play assassin.</p>
<p>Dragon Army had been set low in the water at the start of the
game; above and far away, the distant underwater moon shone. The
murky water was mostly lit by <i>Lumos</i> Charms, though his
soldiers would extinguish the lights as soon as they began
maneuvers. There was no point in letting the enemy see you before
you saw them.</p>
<p>Draco kicked his legs a few times, propelling him to a higher
position from which he could gaze down at where his soldiers
hovered in the water.</p>
<p>The conversations died down almost at once under Draco's icy
glare, his soldiers looking up at him with gratifying expressions
of fear and worry.</p>
<p>"Listen to me very carefully," said General Malfoy. His voice
came out a little lower, a little burbly with bubbles, <i>libsten
to me vebwy caerbfully</i>, but the sound traveled clearly.
"There's only one way we can win this. We've got to march on
Sunshine together with Chaos, and beat Sunshine. <i>Then</i> we
fight it out with Potter and win. That's <i>got</i> to happen,
understand? No matter what else goes on, that part <i>has</i> to
happen that way -"</p>
<p>And Draco explained the plan he and Harry had come up with.</p>
<p>Astonished looks were exchanged among the soldiers.</p>
<p>"- and if any of <i>your</i> plots get in the way of that,"
finished Draco, "after we are out of the water, I will set you on
<i>fire</i>."</p>
<p>There was a nervous chorus of yessirs.</p>
<p>"And everyone with secret orders, make sure you carry them out
<i>to the letter,</i>" said Draco.</p>
<p>Around half his soldiers <i>openly nodded,</i> and Draco marked
them for death after he rose to power.</p>
<p>Of course all the private orders were fake, like one Dragon
being told to offer a false traitor's commission to another Dragon,
and the second Dragon being told in hushed confidence to report
anything said by the first Dragon. Draco had told each Dragon that
the whole war could depend on that one thing, and that he hoped
they understood it was more important than the plans they'd
previously made. With luck that would keep all the idiots happy,
and maybe flush out a few spies to boot, if the reports didn't
match the instructions.</p>
<p>Draco's real plan for winning against Chaos... well, it was
simpler than the one he'd burned, but Father still wouldn't have
liked it. Despite trying, though, Draco hadn't been able to think
of anything better. It was a plot that couldn't <i>possibly</i>
have worked against anyone except Harry Potter. In fact it had
<i>been</i> Harry's plan originally, according to the traitor,
though Draco had guessed that without being told. Draco and the
traitor had just modified it a little...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry took a deep breath, feeling the water gurgle harmlessly in
his lungs.</p>
<p>They'd fought in the forest, and he hadn't gotten a chance to
say it.</p>
<p>They'd fought in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he hadn't gotten
a chance to say it.</p>
<p>They'd fought in the air, broomsticks issued to every soldier,
and it still hadn't made sense to say it.</p>
<p>Harry had thought he wouldn't ever get to say those words, not
while he was still young enough for them to be real...</p>
<p>The Chaos Legionnaires were looking at Harry in puzzlement, as
their general swam with his feet pointing up toward the distant
light of the surface, and his head pointed down toward the murky
depths.</p>
<p>"<i>Why are you upside down?</i>" the young commander shouted
at his army, and began to explain how to fight after you abandoned
the privileged orientation of gravity.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A hollow, booming bell echoed through the water, and on the
instant, Zabini and Anthony and five other soldiers struck out
downward, into the murky depths of the lake. Parvati Patil, the
only Gryffindor in the group, turned her head back for a moment and
gave them all a cheery wave as she dived; and after a moment, Scott
and Matt did the same. The rest just sank and vanished.</p>
<p>General Granger swallowed a lump in her throat as she watched
them go. She was risking everything on this, dividing her army
instead of just trying to take as many enemy soldiers with them as
possible.</p>
<p>The thing to realize, Zabini had told her, was that no army
would move until they had a plan that let them expect victory.
Sunshine couldn't just plan to win themselves, they had to make
both other armies <i>think</i> they would win until it was too
late.</p>
<p>Ernie and Ron still looked like they were in shock. Susan was
gazing after the disappearing soldiers with a calculating look. Her
army, what was left of it, just looked bewildered, traceries of
light dappling on their uniforms as they all drifted just below the
sunlit surface of the lake.</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i> what?" said Ron.</p>
<p>"Now we wait," said Hermione, loudly enough for all the soldiers
to hear. It felt odd to talk with her mouth full of water, she kept
feeling like she was committing some sort of horrible impoliteness
at the dinner table and was about to drool all over herself. "All
of us left here are going to get zapped, but that was going to
happen anyway with Dragon and Chaos ganging up on us. We've just
got to take as many of them with us as we can."</p>
<p>"I've got a plan," said one of her Sunshine Soldiers... Hannah,
her voice had been a little hard to recognize at first. "It's like
all complicated, but I know how we can get Dragon and Chaos to
start fighting each other -"</p>
<p>"Me too!" said Fay. "I've got a plan too! See, Neville
Longbottom is secretly on our side -"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> were talking to Neville?" said Ernie. "That's not
right, <i>I</i> was the one who -"</p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass and a couple of other Slytherins who hadn't
gone with Zabini were giggling helplessly as the cries of "No,
wait, <i>I</i> was the one who got Longbottom" erupted from one
soldier after another.</p>
<p>Hermione just looked at them all wearily.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione when it had all died down, "does everyone
get it? All your plots were faked by the Chaos Legion, or maybe
some by Dragon. Anyone who <i>really</i> wanted to betray Harry or
Malfoy went straight to me or Zabini, not you. Just go ahead and
compare notes on all your secret plots and you'll see it for
yourselves." She might not be as good at plotting as Zabini, but
she could always understand what all her officers told her, that
was why Professor Quirrell had made her the general. "So don't
bother trying to do any plots when the other armies get here. Just
fight, okay? Please?"</p>
<p>"But," said Ernie with shock on his face, "Neville is in
<i>Hufflepuff!</i> You're saying he <i>lied</i> to us?"</p>
<p>Daphne was laughing so hard and so helplessly that the
exhalations had turned her upside down in the water.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure <i>what</i> Longbottom is," said Ron darkly, "but
I don't think he's a Hufflepuff any more. Not now that <i>Harry
Potter's</i> got to him."</p>
<p>"Do you know," said Susan, "I <i>asked</i> him that, and Neville
told me he had become a Chaos Hufflepuff?"</p>
<p>"<i>Anyway</i>," said Hermione in a loud voice. "Zabini took
with everyone who we thought was a spy, so in <i>our</i> army we
can stop watching each other quite so hard now, I hope."</p>
<p>"<i>Anthony</i> was a spy?" yelled Ron.</p>
<p>"<i>Parvati</i> was a spy?" gasped Hannah.</p>
<p>"Parvati was <i>totally</i> a spy," said Daphne. "She shopped at
the spy shoe store and wore spy lipstick, and someday she's going
to marry a nice spy husband and have a lot of little spies."</p>
<p>And then a gong sound echoed through the water, indicating that
Sunshine had just scored two points.</p>
<p>This was shortly followed by the triple gong of Dragon losing a
single point.</p>
<p>Traitors weren't allowed to kill generals, not after the
disaster of the first battle in December when all three generals
had been shot in the first minute. But with any luck...</p>
<p>"Aw," said Hermione. "It sounds like Mr. Crabbe is taking a
little nap."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Like two shoals of fish, the armies swam along.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions.
Diving, always diving in whatever direction you happened to be
moving. You wanted to show the enemy the smallest profile, present
them with your head or your feet. So you were always diving,
downward and head-first, and the enemy was always <i>down.</i></p>
<p>Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville's head was
constantly rotating as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every
side. Not just watching for Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any
sign that a Chaos Legionnaire had drawn their wand and was about to
betray them. Usually traitors waited until the confusion of battle
to make their move, but that early gong had put them all on
guard.</p>
<p>...the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In
November he'd been a soldier in a united army, all of them pulling
together and helping each other, and now they were all watching
each other constantly for the first signs of betrayal. It might
have been more fun for General Chaos, but it wasn't nearly as much
fun for Neville.</p>
<p>The direction formerly known as 'up' was getting steadily
brighter, as they came closer to the surface and Sunshine.</p>
<p>"Wands out," said General Chaos.</p>
<p>Neville's squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead
toward the enemy, as their heads scanned around more rapidly. If
there were Sunny traitors, the time was approaching for them to
strike.</p>
<p>The other shoal of fish, Dragon Army, was doing the same
thing.</p>
<p>"<i>Now!</i>" shouted the distant voice of the Dragon
General.</p>
<p>"<i>Now!</i>" shouted General Chaos.</p>
<p>"<i>For Sunshine!"</i> shouted all the soldiers in both armies,
and charged downward.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Minerva involuntarily as she watched the
screens from next to the lake, a cry echoed in many other places;
all of Hogwarts was watching this battle as they had watched the
first.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was laughing dryly. "I warned you,
Headmaster. It is impossible to have rules without Mr. Potter
exploiting them."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>For long precious seconds, as the forty-seven soldiers charged
her own seventeen, Hermione's mind went blank.</p>
<p>Why...</p>
<p>Then it all snapped into place.</p>
<p>Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by
someone crying the name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell
point. When two Sunshine Soldiers were shot by either army,
<i>both</i> enemy armies would be two points closer to overtaking
her, it was the same gain only <i>shared</i>. And if anyone shot
another soldier <i>not</i> in the name of Sunshine, that gong
<i>wouldn't</i> get lost in the confusion...</p>
<p>Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn't gone with the
obvious plan of starting trouble between the other two armies while
they attacked Sunshine.</p>
<p>It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances
closing down, of hope being taken away.</p>
<p>Most of Hermione's soldiers were still looking confused, but
some had expressions of dawning horror as they got it.</p>
<p>"It's all right," Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look
at the Sunshine Captain. "Our job is the same, to take as many of
them with us as we can. And remember, Zabini took away all the
spies! We don't have to stay on the lookout like <i>they</i> do!"
The girl was smiling defiantly, provoking answering smiles from
many of the other soldiers, even from Hermione herself. "It can be
like it was in November. We just have to keep our heads high, fight
our best, and trust each other -"</p>
<p>Daphne shot her.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Blood for the blood god!</i>" shrieked Neville of Chaos,
though since he was underwater it came out more like 'Blubbled for
the blubbled glub!'</p>
<p>Captain Weasley spun and raised his wand toward Neville and
fired. But Neville was swimming <i>downward</i> toward him, wand
pointed straight ahead, and that meant the Simple Shield could
shelter Neville's entire profile; if anyone shot him now, it wasn't
going to be Sunny Ron.</p>
<p>A grimly determined look came over Captain Weasley's face, and
he arrowed straight up toward Neville, mouthing the word
<i>Contego,</i> though the shield wasn't visible in the water.</p>
<p>The two enemy champions shot toward each other like arrows
released from bows, each aimed to split the other down the middle.
They had dueled many times before, but this time would pay for
all.</p>
<p>(Far away by the lakeside, a hundred breaths were held.)</p>
<p>"<i>Rainbows and unicorns!</i>" roared the Sunshine
Captain.</p>
<p>"<i>The Black Goat with a thousand young!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Do your homework!</i>"</p>
<p>Closer and yet closer, the two champions charged, neither
willing to swerve, the first person to turn would present a
vulnerable broadside and get shot, though if neither lost their
nerve they would crash right into each other...</p>
<p>Falling straight down as the enemy rose straight up to meet him,
hammer descending to meet anvil in a path neither was willing to
leave...</p>
<p>"<i>Special attack, Chaotic Twist!</i>"</p>
<p>Neville saw the look of horror on Captain Weasley's face as the
Hover Charm caught him. They'd tested it before the battle had
started; and just as Harry had suspected, <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>
became a whole new sort of weapon once everyone was swimming
underwater.</p>
<p>"<i>Curse you, Longbottom!</i>" shrieked Ron Weasley, "<i>Can't
you ever fight without your dumb special attacks -</i>"</p>
<p>and by that time the Sunshine Captain had been spun around
sideways and Neville shot him in the leg.</p>
<p>"I don't fight fair," said Neville to the sleeping form, "I
fight like Harry Potter."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220</i></p>
<p>It still hurt every time he had to shoot Hermione. Harry could
hardly stand to look at the expression of peace that had come over
her sleeping face, arms now drifting aimlessly as the curves of
sunlight moved over her camouflage uniform and the cloud of her
chestnut hair.</p>
<p>And if Harry had tried to duck out of being the one to shoot
her... not only would Draco have known what it meant,
<i>Hermione</i> would have been offended.</p>
<p><i>She's not dead,</i> Harry said to his brain as his kicking
feet pushed him away, <i>she's just resting. IDIOT.</i></p>
<p><i>Are you sure?</i> said his brain. <i>What if she's an
ex-Hermione? Could we go back and check?</i></p>
<p>Harry glanced back briefly.</p>
<p><i>See, she's fine, there are bubbles coming out of her
mouth.</i></p>
<p><i>Could've been her last breath escaping.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh be quiet. Why are you being so paranoid-protective,
anyway?</i></p>
<p><i>Er, first real friend we've ever had in our whole life? Hey,
remember what happened to our pet rock?</i></p>
<p><i>Would you SHUT UP about that worthless lump of rubble, it
wasn't even alive let alone sentient, that is like the most
pathetic childhood trauma ever -</i></p>
<p>The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish
once more.</p>
<p>General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken three
Chaotics and two Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragons
had been shot as traitors. So she'd lost net seven points, Harry
had lost one, Draco had lost two; that put Sunshine twenty points
up on Dragon, and seventeen points up on Chaos. Chaos could still
win easily if they exterminated all twenty remaining Dragons. The
wild card, of course, being those seven remaining Sunshine
Soldiers...</p>
<p>...if you could call them that.</p>
<p>The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in
each army awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and
attack...</p>
<p>"Everyone who got them," Harry said loudly, "remember Special
Orders One through Three. And don't forget it's Merlin Says on
Three. Do not acknowledge."</p>
<p>The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the
other third just looked puzzled.</p>
<p><i>Special Order One: Don't bother trying to call out any
codewords in this battle, don't expend effort on any plot not
specially approved by the commander; just swim, shield, and
fire.</i></p>
<p>Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying
to get them to stop plotting on their own all through December.
Harry had egged his soldiers on and supported their plotting
through the last two battles... while also telling them that at
some <i>future</i> point he might ask them to put a plot or two on
hold, to which they'd all readily agreed. So now, in this critical
battle, they were happy to obey.</p>
<p>Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order
successfully, Harry was certain. It was the difference between your
soldiers seeing you as an ally in their plotting, and seeing you as
a spoilsport old fuddy-duddy who didn't want them to have any fun.
Imposition of order equaled escalation of chaos, and it also worked
in reverse...</p>
<p>"There they are!" shouted someone, and pointed.</p>
<p>From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones
who'd forsaken the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine
Soldiers, glowing with the bright aura of cowards, now fading as
they returned to battle.</p>
<p>The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.</p>
<p>"Hold your fire!" shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from
General Malfoy.</p>
<p>There was a moment of held breath.</p>
<p>Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon
Army.</p>
<p>There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army.</p>
<p>There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn't
have.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't smiling.</p>
<p><i>Oh, this is so completely not going to work...</i></p>
<p>But Harry hadn't been able to think of anything better.</p>
<p>"Special Orders Two and Three still apply!" shouted Harry.
"Fight!"</p>
<p>"<i>For the Chaos Legion!</i>" roared twenty Chaotic
Legionnaires.</p>
<p>"<i>For Dragon Army!</i>" roared twenty Dragon Warriors and
seven Sunshine Soldiers.</p>
<p>And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors
got ready to strike.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226</i></p>
<p>Draco's head darted around frantically, trying to weigh up what
was happening; somehow, despite his greater forces, he'd <i>lost
the initiative.</i> Four small Chaotic forces were being pursued by
four larger Dragon forces, but because Draco's forces were the ones
trying to force an engagement, it meant that they had to
<i>follow</i> where Chaos <i>ran,</i> and somehow that was
producing concentrations of Chaotic force that would fire into the
exposed sides of Dragon -</p>
<p>It was happening <i>again!</i></p>
<p>"<i>Prismatis!</i>" shouted Draco, raising his wand, and that
shield you could see even through the water, a sparkling
multicolored flat wall wide enough to shield Draco and the five
other Dragons with him from the Chaotic force that had just started
firing on them as they swam past, and <i>that</i> let the other
five Dragons turn <i>their</i> attentions back to the Chaotic force
they'd been chasing -</p>
<p>There was a tense moment as sleep spell after sleep spell
crashed into Draco's Prismatic Wall, and Draco was hoping to Merlin
that none of those four Chaotics had learned the Breaking Drill Hex
-</p>
<p>Then there was the bell of a Dragon victory, and the Chaotic
force spun head-for-foot and began swimming away; and Draco, his
hands now shaking slightly, dropped the Prismatic Wall and lowered
his wand.</p>
<p>Fighting in water was more exhausting even than fighting on
broomsticks.</p>
<p>"<i>Do not pursue!</i>" Draco cried to his soldiers as they
started to follow, then, "<i>Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!</i>"</p>
<p>The Dragon forces started converging on Draco, and the Chaotic
forces spun around and began <i>pursuing</i> the Dragons on the
instant - Draco swore out loud as he heard the bell of a Chaotic
victory, someone hadn't gotten their Simple Shield oriented right -
and then the Dragon forces were in supporting range of each other
and the Chaotics were moving back into the murky distance.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite their numerical superiority, the Dragons had
scored three times against the Chaotics and the Chaotics had scored
four times back, and he'd heard one Dragon spy get executed. Either
Harry Potter had thought of a lot of very good ideas very fast, or
for some unimaginable reason he'd already spent a lot of time
working out how to fight underwater. This wasn't working, and Draco
needed to rethink things.</p>
<p>It looked like everyone was having trouble aiming while
swimming, too, the battle might last long enough that time would be
called... the distant underwater moon was only half full now, that
wasn't good... he had to rethink things <i>fast...</i></p>
<p>"What is it?" said Padma Patil, as she and her force swam over
toward Draco.</p>
<p>Padma was his second-in-command; she was clever and powerful,
and better yet, she hated Granger and saw Harry as a rival, which
made her <i>trustworthy.</i> Working with Padma was making him
realize the truth of the old adage that Ravenclaw was sister to
Slytherin; Draco had been surprised when his father had told him it
was an acceptable House for his future wife, but now he saw the
sense of it.</p>
<p>"Wait until we're all here," Draco said. The truth was, he
needed to catch his breath. That was the trouble with being the
general <i>and</i> the most powerful wizard, you had to keep using
magic.</p>
<p>Zabini came in next, commanding a force of two Sunnies and four
Dragons, one of whom was Gregory keeping an eye on Zabini. Draco
didn't trust Zabini. And neither Draco nor Zabini trusted the
Sunnies enough to make them a majority of any unit; they were
<i>supposed</i> to be loyal either to Draco directly, or to Granger
who'd been fooled by the promise that the Dragons would be betrayed
in the end after both forces had been depleted, just as Harry's
more trusted Chaotics should've been fooled into not shooting at
the Sunnies by the promise of their firing fake Sleep Hexes and
switching to support Chaos later; but it was possible some of the
Sunnies <i>were</i> loyal to Chaos and <i>weren't</i> firing real
Sleep Hexes and that was why Dragon wasn't winning the way their
numerical advantage should've let them win...</p>
<p>The next unit that approached was depleted, three soldiers
holding wands on two other soldiers, who were swimming with empty
hands.</p>
<p>Draco gritted his teeth. More traitor problems. He needed to
talk to Professor Quirrell about having some way to <i>punish</i>
traitors at least, conditions like these were <i>unrealistic</i>,
in real life you tortured your traitors to death.</p>
<p>"General Malfoy!" shouted the commander of the problem unit as
it swam up, a Ravenclaw boy named Terry. "We don't know what to do
- Cesi shot Bogdan, but Cesi says Kellah told him that Bogdan shot
Specter -"</p>
<p>"I <i>didn't!</i>" said Kellah.</p>
<p>"Yes you <i>did!</i>" shrieked Cesi. "General Malfoy,
<i>she's</i> the spy, I should've rea-"</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium,</i>" said Draco.</p>
<p>There was the triple bell of a one-point loss from Dragon, and
then Kellah's limp body began to float away in the water.</p>
<p>Draco <i>had</i> heard the word 'recursion' by this point, and
he knew a Harry Potter plot when he saw one.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately Draco had <i>not</i> heard of autoimmune
disorders, and the thought did <i>not</i> readily occur to him that
a clever virus would begin its attack by creating symptoms of an
autoimmune disorder so as to get the body to distrust its own
immune system...)</p>
<p>"<i>General order!</i>" said Draco, raising his voice. "Nobody
gets to shoot spies except myself, Gregory, Padma, and Terry. If
anyone sees anything suspicious they come to one of <i>us.</i>"</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>There was the bell of Sunshine scoring two points.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Draco and Zabini around the same time;
their heads swiveled around. No one seemed to have gotten hit, and
all the Sunshine soldiers were present and accounted for. (Except
Parvati, who had been shot by some still-unknown traitor in Padma's
squad; and of course Padma had shot Parvati again in case she was
faking, so it wasn't her...)</p>
<p>"A Sunny traitor in Chaos?" said Zabini, sounding puzzled. "But
all the ones I knew about were supposed to strike during Chaos's
attack on Sunshine -"</p>
<p>"No!" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. "That was
<i>Chaos</i> executing a spy!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Zabini. "But why -"</p>
<p>And Draco got it. <i>Damn it!</i> "Because Potter thinks he's
safe for how much he beats Sunshine, but not for how much he beats
<i>us!</i> So he doesn't want to lose a single point when he
executes a traitor! <i>General order!</i> If you have to execute a
traitor, call Sunshine first! And don't forget to switch back to
Dragon afterward -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252</i></p>
<p>Longbottom's body drifted chaotically through the water, arms
and legs disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they'd
all shot him <i>again</i> just to be sure.</p>
<p>Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere,
looking at them all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon
slowly diminished, somewhere far away. If Longbottom had managed to
shoot one more soldier (Draco knew Harry was thinking), if the two
Chaotics had managed to hold out just a little longer, they might
have <i>won</i>...</p>
<p>After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the
ensuing battle and execution of spies in Sunshine's name had left
Sunshine exactly one point ahead of Dragon and Chaos both. Once
Harry had started doing it, Draco had been left with no choice but
to follow suit.</p>
<p>But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the
survivors of Dragon Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor:
Draco, and Padma, and Zabini.</p>
<p>And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini's
wand after Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco.
The boy had given him an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him
for this, and handed it over.</p>
<p>That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you'd like to surrender?" said Draco, smiling
as evilly as any smile he'd ever directed at Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"Sleep before surrender!" shouted General Chaos.</p>
<p>"Just so you know," said Draco, "Zabini doesn't actually
<i>have</i> an older sister for you to rescue from Gryffindor
bullies. But Zabini <i>does</i> have a mother who doesn't approve
of Muggleborns like Granger, and I wrote her a few notes, and
offered Zabini a few favors - nothing involving my father, just
things <i>I</i> can do in school. And by the way, Zabini's mother
doesn't approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you
still thought Zabini was really on your side."</p>
<p>Harry's face grew even grimmer.</p>
<p>Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically,
building up strength for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger's Prismatic
Sphere was almost as strong as Draco's now, and Harry's wasn't much
weaker, where did those two find <i>time?</i></p>
<p>"<i>Lagann!</i>" spoke Draco, putting everything he had into
it, and the green spiral blazed out and Harry's shield shattered,
and at almost the same moment -</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium!</i>" said Padma.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254</i></p>
<p>Harry let out a long breath of relief, and not just because he
didn't have to hold the Prismatic Sphere any more. His hand was
shaking as he lowered his wand.</p>
<p>"You know," said Harry, "I was pretty worried there for a
moment."</p>
<p><i>Special Order Two: If a Sunny traitor doesn't seem to be
really shooting at you, fake being hit occasionally. Prefer
targeting Dragons to Sunnies but go ahead and shoot Sunnies if you
can't shoot Dragons.</i></p>
<p><i>Special Order Three: Merlin says do not shoot at Blaise
Zabini or either Patil twin.</i></p>
<p>With a wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped the Transfigured patch
off her uniform's insignia, and let it float away in the water.</p>
<p>"Gryffindors for Chaos," she said, and handed Zabini his wand
back.</p>
<p>"Thank you <i>very</i> much," Harry said, and bowed sweepingly
to the Gryffindor girl. "And thank <i>you</i> as well," bowing to
Zabini. "You know, when you came to me with that plan, I wondered
if you were brilliant or crazy, and I've decided that you're both.
And by the way," Harry said, now turning as though to address
Draco's body, "Zabini <i>does</i> have a cousin -"</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium,</i>" said Zabini's voice.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254</i></p>
<p>And Harry Potter's body floated away, his expression of shock
and horror quickly relaxing into sleep.</p>
<p>"On second thought," Parvati said cheerfully, "make that
Gryffindors for Sunshine."</p>
<p>She started to laugh, more exhiliarated than she'd ever been in
her life, she'd <i>finally</i> gotten to assassinate and replace
her twin sister and she'd wanted to do that since <i>forever,</i>
and this had been <i>perfect,</i> it had all been <i>perfect</i>
-</p>
<p>- and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just as
Zabini's wand turned to point at her.</p>
<p>"Wait!" said Zabini. "Do not shoot, do not resist. That's an
order."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Sorry," said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic,
"but I can't be totally <i>sure</i> you're for Sunshine. So I order
you to let me shoot you."</p>
<p>"<i>Hold on!</i>" said Parvati. "We're only ahead of Chaos by
one point! If you shoot me now -"</p>
<p>"I'll shoot you in the name of Dragon, <i>obviously</i>," said
Zabini, now sounding a little superior. "Just because we tricked
<i>them</i> into doing it, doesn't mean it won't work for us."</p>
<p>Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. "General Malfoy said
your mother doesn't like Hermione."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. "But
some of us are more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a
parent."</p>
<p>"And Harry Potter said you have a cousin -"</p>
<p>"Nope," said Zabini.</p>
<p>Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn't really
good at plotting; Zabini'd said the plan was to secretly keep the
scores of Chaos and Dragon as even as possible so they'd use
Sunshine's name to execute their traitors instead of losing even a
single point, and that had <i>worked</i>... but... she had the
feeling she was missing something, she wasn't a Slytherin...</p>
<p>"Why don't <i>I</i> shoot <i>you</i> in the name of Dragon?"
said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Because I outrank you," said Zabini.</p>
<p>Parvati had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>She stared at him for a long moment.</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>"<i>Somni-</i>" she started to say, and then realized she hadn't
said <i>for Dragon,</i> and frantically cut herself off -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 254 / Potter: 254</i></p>
<p>"Hey, everyone," said Blaise Zabini's face on the screens,
looking quite amused, "guess it's all down to me."</p>
<p>All by the lakeside, people were holding their breath.</p>
<p>Sunshine was ahead of Dragon and Chaos by exactly one point.</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini could shoot himself in the name of either Dragon
or Chaos, or just leave things the way they were.</p>
<p>A series of chimes indicated that the last minute of time was
running out.</p>
<p>And the Slytherin was smiling a strange, twisted smile, and
casually toying with his wand, the dark wood barely visible in the
dark water.</p>
<p>"You know," said Blaise Zabini's voice, in the tones of someone
who'd been rehearsing the words for a while, "it's just a game,
really. And games are supposed to be <i>fun.</i> So how about if I
just do whatever I feel like?"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="34">Chapter 34</h2><h3>Coordination Problems, Pt
2</h3>
<p>Minerva and Dumbledore together had applied their combined
talent to conjure the grand stage toward which Quirrell now slowly
trudged; it was, at its core, sturdy wood, but the outer surfaces
shone with glitter of marble inlaid with platinum and studded with
gems of every House color. Neither she nor the Headmaster was any
Founder of Hogwarts, but the conjuration only needed to last a few
hours. Minerva ordinarily enjoyed the few occasions when she had
the occasion to tire herself out on large Transfigurations; she
should have enjoyed the many small chances for artistry, and the
illusion of opulence; but this time she had done the work with the
dreadful feeling of digging her own grave.</p>
<p>But Minerva was feeling a little better now. There'd been one
brief moment when the explosion might've come; but Dumbledore had
already been standing up and applauding warmly, and no one had
proven foolish enough to riot in front of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>And the explosive mood had rapidly faded into a collective
sentiment which might perhaps have been described by the phrase:
<i>Give us a break!</i></p>
<p>Blaise Zabini had shot himself in the name of Sunshine, and the
final score had been 254 to 254 to 254.<i><br /></i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Behind the stage, waiting to ascend, three children were glaring
at each other in mingled fury and frustration. It didn't help that
they were still damp from being fished out of the lake, and that
the Warming Charms didn't seem quite enough to make up for the
crisp December air, or maybe it was just their mood.</p>
<p>"That's <i>it</i>," said Granger. "I've <i>had</i> it! No more
traitors!"</p>
<p>"I completely agree with you, Miss Granger," Draco said icily.
"Enough is enough."</p>
<p>"And what do <i>you</i> two intend to do about it?" snapped
Harry Potter. "Professor Quirrell already said he wouldn't ban
spies!"</p>
<p>"We'll ban them <i>for</i> him," said Draco grimly. He hadn't
even understood what he meant by the words as he said them, but the
very act of speaking seemed to crystallize a plan -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The stage really was well done, at least for a temporary
structure; the makers hadn't fallen into the usual pitfall of being
impressed by their own illusion of wealth, and knew something about
architecture and visual style. From where Draco stood, in the
obvious place for him to stand, the watching students would see him
haloed in the faint glitter of emeralds; and Granger, standing
where Draco had subtly motioned her, would be haloed in Ravenclaw's
sapphire. As for Harry Potter, Draco wasn't looking at him right
now.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had... awakened, or whatever it was he did;
and was leaning upon a platinum podium bare of all gems. With
evident showmanship, the Defense Professor was carefully stacking
and squaring those three envelopes containing the three parchments
upon which the three generals had written their wishes, as all the
students of Hogwarts watched, and waited.</p>
<p>Finally Professor Quirrell looked up from the envelopes. "Well,"
said the Defense Professor. "This is inconvenient."</p>
<p>A slight titter of laughter ran through the crowd, with a sharp
undertone.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are all wondering what I will do?" said Professor
Quirrell. "There is nothing for it; I shall have to do what is
fair. Although first there was a little speech I wanted to make,
and before even that, it appears to me that Mr. Malfoy and Miss
Granger have something they wish to share."</p>
<p>Draco blinked, and then he and Granger traded rapid glances -
<i>may I?</i> - <i>yes, go ahead -</i> and Draco raised his
voice.</p>
<p>"General Granger and I would both like to say," Draco said in
his most formal voice, knowing it was being amplified and heard,
"that we will no longer accept the help of any traitors. And if, in
any battle, we find that Potter has accepted traitors from either
of our armies, we will join forces to crush him."</p>
<p>And Draco shot a glance filled at malice at the Boy-Who-Lived.
<i>Take that, General Chaos!</i></p>
<p>"I agree completely with General Malfoy," said Granger standing
beside him, her high voice clear and strong. "Neither of us will
use traitors, and if General Potter does, we will wipe him off the
battlefield."</p>
<p>There was a susurration of surprise from the watching
students.</p>
<p>"Very good," said their Defense Professor, smiling. "It took the
two of you long enough, but you are still to be congratulated on
having thought of it before any other generals."</p>
<p>It took a moment for this to soak in -</p>
<p>"In the future, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, before you come to my
office with any request, consider whether there is a way for you to
accomplish it without my help. I will not deduct Quirrell points on
this occasion, but next time you may expect to lose the full
fifty." Professor Quirrell wore an amused grin. "And what do you
have to say about that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's gaze went to Granger, then to Draco. His face
appeared calm; though Draco was sure <i>controlled</i> would have
been the better term.</p>
<p>Finally Harry Potter spoke, his voice level. "The Chaos Legion
is still happy to accept traitors. See you on the battlefield."</p>
<p>Draco knew the shock was showing on his own face; there were
astonished murmurs from the watching students, and when Draco
glanced at the front row he saw that even Harry's Chaotics looked
taken aback.</p>
<p>Granger's face was angry, and getting angrier. "Mr. Potter," she
said in a sharp tone like she thought she was a teacher, "are you
<i>trying</i> to be obnoxious?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly not," Harry Potter said calmly. "I won't make
you do it every time. Beat me once, and I'll stay beaten. But
threats aren't always enough, General of Sunshine. You did not ask
me to join with you, but tried simply to impose your will; and
sometimes you must actually defeat the enemy, to impose your will
on him. You see, I am skeptical that Hermione Granger, the
brightest academic star of Hogwarts, and Draco, son of Lucius,
scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, can work
together to beat their common foe, Harry Potter." An amused smile
crossed Harry Potter's face. "Maybe I'll just do what Draco tried
with Zabini, and write a letter to Lucius Malfoy and see what
<i>he</i> thinks about that."</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" gasped Granger, looking absolutely aghast, and
there were gasps from the audience as well.</p>
<p>Draco controlled the anger flushing through him. That had been a
<i>stupid</i> move on Harry's part, saying that in public. If Harry
had simply <i>done</i> it, it might have worked, Draco hadn't even
thought about that, but <i>now</i> if Father did that it would look
like he was playing into Harry's hands -</p>
<p>"If you think my father, Lord Malfoy, can be manipulated by
<i>you</i> that easily," Draco said coldly, "you have a surprise
coming, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>And Draco realized as the words finished leaving his mouth that
he'd just backed <i>his own father</i> squarely into the corner,
more or less without even meaning to. Father probably <i>wasn't</i>
going to like this, not the tiniest bit, but now it would be
impossible for him to say so... Draco would have to apologize for
that, it <i>had</i> been an honest accident, but it was strange to
think that he'd done it at all.</p>
<p>"Then go ahead and defeat the evil General Chaos," Harry said,
still looking amused. "I can't win against both your armies - not
if you <i>really</i> work together. But I wonder if perhaps I could
break you up before then."</p>
<p>"You won't, and we'll <i>crush</i> you!" said Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>And beside him, Hermione Granger firmly nodded.</p>
<p>"Well," said Professor Quirrell after the astounded silence had
stretched for a while. "That was <i>not</i> how I expected that
particular conversation to go." The Defense Professor had a rather
intrigued expression on his face. "Truthfully, Mr. Potter, I
expected you to concede immediately and with a smile, then announce
that you had long since worked out my intended lesson but had
decided not to spoil it for others. Indeed, I planned my speech
accordingly, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry Potter just shrugged. "Sorry about that," he said, and
said nothing more.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," said Professor Quirrell. "This, too, will
serve."</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell turned from the three children, and
straightened at the podium to address the whole watching crowd; his
customary air of detached amusement dropped away like a falling
mask, and when he spoke again his voice was amplified louder than
it had been.</p>
<p>"If not for Harry Potter," said Professor Quirrell, his voice as
crisp and cold as December, "You-Know-Who would have won."</p>
<p>The silence was instant, and total.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Make no mistake," said Professor Quirrell. "The Dark Lord
<i>was</i> winning. There were fewer and fewer Aurors who dared
face him, the vigilantes who opposed him were being hunted down.
One Dark Lord and perhaps fifty Death Eaters were <i>winning</i>
against a country of thousands. That is beyond ridiculous! There
are no grades low enough for me to mark that incompetence!"</p>
<p>There was a frown on the face of Headmaster Dumbledore; and on
the faces of the audience, puzzlement; and the utter silence went
on.</p>
<p>"Do you understand now how it happened? You saw it today. I
allowed traitors, and gave the generals no means to restrain them.
You saw the result. Clever plots and clever betrayals, until the
last soldier left on the battlefield shot himself! You cannot
<i>possibly</i> doubt that all three of those armies could have
been defeated by <i>any</i> outside foe that was unified within
itself."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell leaned forward at the podium, his voice now
filled with a grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers
open and spread. "Division is weakness," said the Defense
Professor. His hand closed into a tight fist. "Unity is strength.
The Dark Lord understood that well, whatever his other follies; and
he <i>used</i> that understanding to create the one simple
invention that made him the most terrible Dark Lord in history.
Your parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters who were
perfectly unified, knowing that any breach of their loyalty would
be punished by death, that any slack or incompetence would be
punished by pain. None could escape the Dark Lord's grasp once they
took his Mark. And the Death Eaters agreed to take that terrible
Mark because they knew that once they took it, they would be
<i>united</i>, facing a divided land. One Dark Lord and fifty Death
Eaters would have defeated an entire country, by the power of the
Dark Mark."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice was bleak and hard. "Your parents
<i>could</i> have fought back in kind. They did not. There was a
man named Yermy Wibble who called upon the nation to institute a
draft, though he did not quite have vision enough to propose a Mark
of Britain. Yermy Wibble knew what would happen to him; he hoped
his death would inspire others. So the Dark Lord took his family
for good measure. Their empty skins inspired nothing but fear, and
no one dared to speak again. And your parents would have faced the
consequences of their despicable cowardice, if not for being saved
by a one-year-old boy." Professor Quirrell's face showed full
contempt. "A dramatist would have called that a <i>dei ex
machina,</i> for they did nothing to earn their salvation.
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may not have deserved to win, but make no
doubt of it, your parents deserved to lose."</p>
<p>The voice of the Defense Professor rang forth like iron. "And
know this: your parents have learned nothing! The nation is still
fragmented and weak! How few decades passed between Grindelwald and
You-Know-Who? Do you think <i>you</i> will not see the next threat
in your own lifetimes? Will <i>you</i> repeat then the follies of
your parents, when you have seen the results so clearly laid out
before you this day? For I can tell you what your parents will do,
when the day of darkness comes! I can tell you what lesson they
have learned! They have learned to hide like cowards and do nothing
while they wait for Harry Potter to save them!"</p>
<p>There was a wondering look in the eyes of Headmaster Dumbledore;
and other students gazed up at their Defense Professor with
bewilderment and anger and awe.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes were as cold now as his voice. "Mark
this, and mark it well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished to rule
over this country, to hold it in his cruel grasp forever. But at
least he wished to rule over a <i>living</i> country, and not a
heap of ash! There have been Dark Lords who were mad, who wished
only to make the world a vast funeral pyre! There have been wars in
which one whole country marched against another! Your parents
nearly lost against half a hundred, who thought to take this
country alive! How quickly would they have been crushed by a foe
more numerous than they, a foe that cared for nothing but their
destruction? This I foretell: When the next threat rises, Lucius
Malfoy will claim that you must follow him or perish, that your
only hope is to trust in his cruelty and strength. And though
Lucius Malfoy himself will believe it, this will be a lie. For when
the Dark Lord perished, Lucius Malfoy did not unite the Death
Eaters, they were shattered in an instant, they fled like whipped
dogs and betrayed each other! Lucius Malfoy is not strong enough to
be a true Lord, Dark or otherwise."</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy's fists were clenched white, there were tears in
his eyes, and fury, and unbearable shame.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, "I do not think it will be Lucius
Malfoy who saves you. And lest you think that I speak on my own
behalf, time will make clear soon enough that this is not so. I
make you no recommendation, my students. But I say that if a whole
country were to find a leader as strong as the Dark Lord, but
honorable and pure, and take his Mark; then they could crush any
Dark Lord like an insect, and all the rest of our divided magical
world could not threaten them. And if some still greater enemy rose
against us in a war of extermination, then only a united magical
world could survive."</p>
<p>There were gasps, mostly from Muggleborns; the students in
green-trimmed robes looked merely puzzled. Now it was Harry Potter
whose fists were clenched tight and trembling; and Hermione Granger
beside him was angry and dismayed.</p>
<p>The Headmaster rose from his seat, his face now stern, saying no
word as yet; but the command was clear.</p>
<p>"I do not say <i>what</i> threat will come," said Professor
Quirrell. "But you will not live all your lives in peace, not if
the past history of the world is any guide at all to its future.
And if you do in the future as you have seen three armies do this
day, if you cannot throw aside your petty bickering and take the
Mark of a single leader, then indeed you might wish that the Dark
Lord had lived to rule over you, and regret the day that ever Harry
Potter was born -"</p>
<p>"<i>Enough!</i>" bellowed Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell slowly turned his head to gaze at where Albus
Dumbledore stood in the fury of his wizardry; their eyes met, and a
soundless stress pressed down like weight upon all the students, as
they listened not daring to move.</p>
<p>"You, too, failed this country," said Professor Quirrell. "And
you know the peril as well as I."</p>
<p>"Such speeches are not for the ears of students," said Albus
Dumbledore in a dangerously rising voice. "Nor for the mouths of
professors!"</p>
<p>Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: "There were many speeches
made for the ears of adults, as the Dark Lord rose. And the adults
clapped and cheered, and went home having enjoyed their day's
entertainment. But I will obey you, Headmaster, and make no further
speeches if you do not like them. My lesson is simple. I will go on
doing nothing about traitors, and we will see what students can do
for themselves about that, when they do not wait for professors to
save them."</p>
<p>And then Professor Quirrell turned back to his students, and his
mouth quirked up in a wry grin that seemed to dissipate the
dreadful pressure like a god blowing to scatter the clouds. "But do
please be kind to the traitors up until now," said Professor
Quirrell. "They were just having fun."</p>
<p>There was laughter, though it was nervous at first, and then it
seemed to build, as Professor Quirrell stood there smiling wryly
and some of the tension released itself.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco's mind was still whirling through a thousand questions and
a daze of horror, as Professor Quirrell prepared to open the
envelopes in which the three had inscribed their wishes.</p>
<p>It had never before occurred to Draco that moon-traveling
Muggles were a greater threat than the slow decline of wizardry, or
that Father had proven himself too weak to stop them.</p>
<p>And even stranger, the obvious implication: Professor Quirrell
believed that <i>Harry</i> could. The Defense Professor claimed to
have made no recommendation, but he'd mentioned Harry Potter over
and over in his speech; others would already be thinking the same
thing as Draco.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous. The boy who had covered a stuffed chair in
glitter and called it a throne -</p>
<p><i>The boy who faced down Snape and won,</i> whispered a
traitorous voice, <i>that boy could grow into a Lord strong enough
to rule, strong enough to save us all -</i></p>
<p>Harry had been <i>raised</i> by Muggles! He was practically a
mudblood himself, he wouldn't fight against his adopted family
-</p>
<p><i>He knows their arts, their secrets and their methods; he can
take all of the Muggles' science and use it against them, alongside
our own power as wizards.</i></p>
<p>But what if he refuses? What if he's too weak?</p>
<p><i>Then,</i> said that inner voice, <i>it will have to be you,
won't it, Draco Malfoy?</i></p>
<p>And then there was a renewed hush from the crowd, as Professor
Quirrell opened the first envelope.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell, "your wish is for...
Slytherin to win the House Cup."</p>
<p>There was a puzzled pause from the watching audience.</p>
<p>"Yes, Professor," said Draco in a clear voice, knowing that it
was once again being amplified. "If you can't do that, then
something else for Slytherin -"</p>
<p>"I will not award House points unfairly," said Professor
Quirrell. He tapped a cheek, looking thoughtful. "Which makes your
wish difficult enough to be interesting. Would you like to say
anything about why, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco turned from the Defense Professor, gazed out at the crowd
from against that backdrop of platinum and emeralds. Not all of
Slytherin had cheered for Dragon Army, there were anti-Malfoy
factions who had expressed that dissatisfaction by supporting the
Boy-Who-Lived, or even Granger; and those factions would be
encouraged greatly by what Zabini had done. He needed to remind
them that Slytherin meant Malfoy and Malfoy meant Slytherin -</p>
<p>"No," said Draco. "They're Slytherins, they'll understand."</p>
<p>There was some laughter from the audience, especially in
Slytherin, even from some students who would have called themselves
anti-Malfoy a moment earlier.</p>
<p>Flattery was a lovely thing.</p>
<p>Draco turned back to look at Professor Quirrell again, and was
surprised to see an embarrassed look on Granger's face.</p>
<p>"And for Miss Granger..." said Professor Quirrell. There was the
sound of a tearing envelope. "Your wish is for... Ravenclaw to win
the House Cup?"</p>
<p>There was considerable laughter from the audience, including a
chuckle from Draco. He hadn't thought Granger played that game.</p>
<p>"Well, um," said Granger, sounding like she was suddenly
stumbling over a memorized speech, "I meant to say, that..." She
took a deep breath. "There were soldiers from every House in my
army, and I don't mean to slight any of them. But Houses should
still count for something, too. It was sad when students in the
same House were hexing each other just because they were in
different armies. People should be able to rely on whoever's in
their House. That's why Godric Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin,
and Rowena Ravenclaw, and Helga Hufflepuff created the four Houses
of Hogwarts in the first place. I'm the General of Sunshine, but
even before that, I'm Hermione Granger of Ravenclaw, and I'm proud
to be part of a House that's eight hundred years old."</p>
<p>"Well said, Miss Granger!" said Dumbledore's booming voice.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was frowning, and something tickled at the edge of
Draco's recognition.</p>
<p>"An interesting sentiment, Miss Granger," said Professor
Quirrell. "But there are times when it is good for a Slytherin to
have friends in Ravenclaw, or for a Gryffindor to have friends in
Hufflepuff. Surely it would be best if you could rely both on your
friends in your House, and also your friends in your army?"</p>
<p>Granger's eyes flicked briefly toward the watching students and
teachers, and she said nothing.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded as though to himself, and then turned
back to the podium, and took up and tore open the last envelope.
Beside Draco, Harry Potter visibly tensed up as the Defense
Professor drew forth the parchment. "And Mr. Potter wishes for
-"</p>
<p>There was a pause as Professor Quirrell looked at the
parchment.</p>
<p>Then, without any change of expression on Professor Quirrell's
face, the sheet of parchment burst into flames, and burned with a
brief, intense fire that left only drifting black dust sprinkling
down from his hand.</p>
<p>"Please confine yourself to the possible, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, sounding very dry indeed.</p>
<p>There was a long pause; Harry, standing beside Draco, looked
rather shaken.</p>
<p><i>What in Merlin's name did he ask for?</i></p>
<p>"I do hope," said Professor Quirrell, "that you prepared another
wish, if I could not grant that one."</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>Harry drew a deep breath. "I didn't," he said, "but I already
thought of another one." Harry Potter turned to look out at the
audience, and his voice firmed as he spoke. "People fear traitors
because of the damage the traitor does directly, the soldiers they
shoot or the secrets they tell. But that's only part of the danger.
What people do because they're <i>afraid</i> of traitors also costs
them. I used that strategy today against Sunshine and Dragon. I
didn't tell my traitors to cause as much direct damage as possible.
I told them to act in the way that would create the most distrust
and confusion, and make the generals do the most costly things to
try and stop them from doing it again. When there are just a few
traitors and a whole country opposing them, it stands to reason
that what a few traitors do might be less damaging than what a
whole country does to stop them, that the cure might be worse than
the disease -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor, his voice suddenly
cutting, "the lesson of history is that you are simply wrong. Your
parents' generation did too little to unify themselves, not too
much! This whole country almost fell, Mr. Potter, though you were
not there to see it. I suggest that you ask your dorm-mates in
Ravenclaw how many of them have lost family to the Dark Lord. Or if
you are wiser, do <i>not</i> ask! <i>Do</i> you have a wish to
make, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"If you don't mind," said the mild voice of Albus Dumbledore, "I
should like to hear what the Boy-Who-Lived has to say. He has more
experience than either of us at stopping wars."</p>
<p>A few people laughed, but not many.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's gaze moved to Dumbledore, and he looked
considering for a moment. "I'm not saying you're wrong, Professor
Quirrell. In the last war, people didn't act together, and a whole
country almost fell to a few dozen attackers, and yes, that was
pathetic. And if we make the same mistake next time, yes, that'll
be even more pathetic. But you never fight the same war twice. And
the problem is, the enemy is <i>also</i> allowed to be smart. If
you're divided you're vulnerable in one way; but when you try to
unite, then you face other risks, and other costs, and the enemy
will try to take advantage of those, too. You can't stop thinking
at just one level of the game."</p>
<p>"Simplicity also has a great deal to commend it, Mr. Potter,"
said the dry voice of the Defense Professor. "I do hope that you
have learned something this day about the dangers of strategies
more complicated than uniting your people and attacking your enemy.
And if all this does not tie into your wish somehow, I shall be
quite annoyed."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry Potter, "it was pretty difficult coming up
with a wish to symbolize the costs of unity. But the problem of
acting together isn't just for wars, it's something we have to
solve all our lives, every day. If everyone is coordinating using
the same rules, and the rules are stupid, then if <i>one</i> person
decides to do things differently, they're breaking the rules. But
if <i>everyone</i> decides to do things differently, they can. It's
exactly the same problem of everyone needing to act together. But
for the <i>first</i> person who speaks out, it seems like they're
going against the crowd. And if you thought that the only important
thing was that people should always be unified, then you could
never change the game, no matter how stupid the rules. So my own
wish, to symbolize what happens when people unite in the wrong
direction, is that in Hogwarts we should play Quidditch without the
Snitch."</p>
<p>"<i>WHAT?</i>" screamed a hundred voices in the crowd, as
Draco's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"The Snitch ruins the whole game," said Harry Potter.
"Everything the other players do ends up being irrelevant. It would
make overwhelmingly more sense to just buy a clock. It's one of
those incredibly stupid things you don't notice just because you
grew up with it, that people only do because everyone else is doing
it -"</p>
<p>But by that point Harry Potter's voice could no longer be heard,
because the riot had started.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, after a gigantic
spout of fire blasted out of the highest tower of Hogwarts to the
sound of a hundred thunders. Draco hadn't known Dumbledore could
<i>do</i> that.</p>
<p>The students sat down again very carefully and quietly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. "So be it, Mr.
Potter. Your will be done." The Defense Professor paused
deliberately. "Of course, I only promised <i>one</i> cunning plot.
And that is all that the three of you will get."</p>
<p>Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now they
still came as a shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger,
they would have been the obvious allies but their wishes were
directly opposed -</p>
<p>"You mean," said Harry, "we have to all agree on a wish?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that would be <i>far</i> too much to ask," said Professor
Quirrell. "The three of you have no common enemy, do you?"</p>
<p>And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might
have imagined it, the Defense Professor's eyes flicked in the
direction of Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell, "I mean that I shall grant three
wishes using a single plot."</p>
<p>There was a confused silence.</p>
<p>"You can't do that," Harry said flatly from beside Draco. "Not
even <i>I</i> can do that. Two of those wishes are mutually
incompatible. It's <i>logically impossible -</i>" and then Harry
cut himself off.</p>
<p>"You're a few years too young to tell me what I can't do, Mr.
Potter," said Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile.</p>
<p>Then the Defense Professor turned back to the watching students.
"Truthfully, I have no confidence in your ability to learn this
day's lesson. Go home, and enjoy your time with your families, or
what's left of them, while they still live. My own family is long
since dead at the Dark Lord's hand. I shall see you all when
classes resume."</p>
<p>In the speechless silence that resulted, Professor Quirrell
already turning to walk off the stage, Draco heard the Defense
Professor's voice say, quietly and no longer amplified, "But you,
Mr. Potter, I would speak to now."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="35">Chapter 35</h2><h3>Coordination Problems, Pt
3</h3>
<p>They had gone to the Defense Professor's office, and Professor
Quirrell had sealed the door before he leaned back in his chair and
spoke.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's voice was very calm, and that unnerved
Harry a good deal more than if Professor Quirrell had been
shouting.</p>
<p>"I am trying," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "to make
allowances for the fact that you are young. That I myself, at the
same age, was a quite extraordinary fool. You speak with adult
style and meddle in adult games, and sometimes I forget that you
are only a meddler. I hope, Mr. Potter, that your childish meddling
has not just killed you, ruined your country, and lost the next
war."</p>
<p>It was very hard for Harry to control his breathing. "Professor
Quirrell, I said a good deal less than I wished to say, but I had
to say something. Your proposals are extremely alarming to anyone
who has the slightest familiarity with Muggle history over the last
century. The Italian fascists, some very nasty people, got their
name from the <i>fasces,</i> a bundle of rods bound together to
symbolize the idea that unity is strength -"</p>
<p>"So the nasty Italian fascists believed that unity is stronger
than division," said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness was beginning to
creep into his voice. "Perhaps they also believed that the sky is
blue, and advocated a policy of not dropping rocks on your
head."</p>
<p><i>Reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the world's stupidest
person may say the sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark
out...</i> "Fine, you're right, that was an ad hominem argument,
it's not wrong <i>because</i> the fascists said it. But Professor
Quirrell, you can't have everyone in a country take the Mark of one
dictator! It's a single point of failure! Look, I'll put it this
way. Suppose the enemy just Imperiuses whoever controls the Mark
-"</p>
<p>"Powerful wizards are not so easy to Imperius," said Professor
Quirrell dryly. "And if you cannot find a worthy leader, you are in
any case doomed. But worthy leaders do exist; the question is
whether the people shall follow them."</p>
<p>Harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration. He wanted
to call a time-out and make Professor Quirrell read <i>The Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich</i> and then start the conversation over
again. "I don't suppose that if I suggested democracy was a better
form of government than dictatorship -"</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, then
opened. "Mr. Potter, the stupidity of Quidditch is transparent to
you because you did not grow up revering the game. If you had never
heard of elections, Mr. Potter, and you simply <i>saw what is
there</i>, what you saw would not please you. Look to our elected
Minister of Magic. Is he the wisest, the strongest, the greatest of
our nation? No; he is a buffoon who is owned in fee simple by
Lucius Malfoy. Wizards went to the polls and chose between
Cornelius Fudge and Tania Leach, who had competed with each other
in a grand and entertaining contest after the <i>Daily Prophet,</i>
which Lucius Malfoy also controls, decided that they were the only
serious candidates. That Cornelius Fudge was genuinely selected as
the best leader our country could offer is not a suggestion anyone
could make with a straight face. It is no different in the Muggle
world, from what I have heard and seen; the last Muggle newspaper I
read mentioned that the previous President of the United States had
been a retired movie actor. If you had not grown up with elections,
Mr. Potter, they would be as transparently silly to you as
Quidditch."</p>
<p>Harry sat there with his mouth open, struggling for words. "The
point of elections isn't to produce the one best leader, it's to
keep politicians scared enough of the voters that they don't go
completely evil like dictators do -"</p>
<p>"The last war, Mr. Potter, was fought between the Dark Lord and
Dumbledore. And while Dumbledore was a flawed leader who was losing
the war, it is <i>ridiculous</i> to suggest that <i>any</i> of the
Ministers of Magic elected during that period could have taken
Dumbledore's place! Strength flows from powerful wizards and their
followers, not from elections and the fools they elect. That is the
lesson of magical Britain's recent history; and I doubt that the
next war will teach you a lesson any different. <i>If</i> you
survive it, Mr. Potter, which you will <i>not</i> do unless you
abandon the enthusiastic illusions of childhood!"</p>
<p>"If you think there are no dangers in the course of action you
advocate," said Harry, and despite everything his voice was growing
sharp, "then that, too, is childish enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Harry stared grimly into Professor Quirrell's eyes, who stared
back without blinking.</p>
<p>"Such dangers," said Professor Quirrell coldly, "are to be
discussed in offices like this one, not in speeches. The fools who
elected Cornelius Fudge are not interested in complications and
caution. Present them with anything more nuanced than a rousing
cheer, and you will face your war alone. <i>That</i>, Mr. Potter,
was your childish error, which Draco Malfoy would not have made
even when he was eight years old. It should have been obvious even
to <i>you</i> that you should have stayed silent, and <i>consulted
with me first</i>, not spoken your worries before the crowd!"</p>
<p>"I am no friend of Albus Dumbledore," said Harry, a cold in his
voice to match Professor Quirrell's. "But he is no child, and he
did not seem to think my concerns were childish, nor that I should
have waited to speak them."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Professor Quirrell, "so you take your cues from the
Headmaster now, do you?" and stood up from behind his desk.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Blaise turned the corner on the way to the office, he saw
that Professor Quirrell was already leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>"Blaise Zabini," said the Defense Professor, straightening; his
eyes were set like dark stones within his face, and his voice sent
a shiver of fear down Blaise's spine.</p>
<p><i>He can't do anything against me, I just have to remember that
-</i></p>
<p>"I believe," said Professor Quirrell, in a clear, cold voice,
"that I have already guessed the name of your employer. But I would
hear it from your own lips, and tell me also the price that bought
you."</p>
<p>Blaise knew he was sweating under his robes, and that the
moisture would be already visible on his forehead. "I got a chance
to show I was better than all three generals, and I took it. A lot
of people hate me now, but there're also plenty of Slytherins
who'll love me for it. What makes you think I'm -"</p>
<p>"You did not devise the plan of today's battle, Mr. Zabini. Tell
me who did."</p>
<p>Blaise swallowed hard. "Well... I mean, in that case... then you
already know who did, right? The only one who's that crazy is
Dumbledore. And he'll protect me if you try to do anything."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Tell me the price." The Defense Professor's eyes were
still hard.</p>
<p>"It's my cousin Kimberly," Blaise said, swallowing again and
trying to control his voice. "She's real, and she's really being
bullied, Potter checked that, he wasn't dumb. Only Dumbledore said
that he'd nudged the bullies into doing it, just for the plan, and
if I worked for <i>him</i> she'd be fine afterward, but if I
<i>did</i> go with Potter, there was more trouble Kimberly could
get into!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was silent for a long moment.</p>
<p>"I see," Professor Quirrell said, his voice now much milder.
"Mr. Zabini, should such an event occur again, you may contact me
directly. I have my own ways of protecting my friends. Now, a final
question: Even with all the power you took into your hands, forcing
a tie would have been difficult. Did Dumbledore instruct you as to
who should win otherwise?"</p>
<p>"Sunshine," said Blaise.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "As I thought." The Defense Professor
sighed. "In your future career, Mr. Zabini, I do not suggest trying
any plots that complicated. They have a tendency to fail."</p>
<p>"Um, I said that to the Headmaster, actually," Blaise said, "and
he said that was why it was important to have more than one plot
going at a time."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell passed a weary hand across his forehead.
"It's a wonder the Dark Lord didn't go mad from fighting
<i>him.</i> You may go on to your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr.
Zabini. I will say nothing of this, but if the Headmaster should
somehow discover that we have spoken, remember my standing offer to
give you what protection I can. You are dismissed."</p>
<p>Blaise didn't wait for any other word, just turned and fled.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Professor Quirrell waited for a time, and then said, "Go ahead,
Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry tore the Cloak of Invisibility off his head and stuffed
into his pouch. He was trembing with so much rage he could hardly
speak. "He <i>what?</i> He did <i>what?</i>"</p>
<p>"You should have deduced it yourself, Mr. Potter," Professor
Quirrell said mildly. "You must learn to blur your vision until you
can see the forest obscured by the trees. Anyone who heard the
stories about you, and who did not know that you were the
mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could easily deduce your ownership of an
invisibility cloak. Step back from these events, blur away their
details, and what do we observe? There was a great rivalry between
students, and their competition ended in a perfect tie. That sort
of thing only happens in stories, Mr. Potter, and there is one
person in this school who thinks in stories. There was a strange
and complicated plot, which you should have realized was
uncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced. But there is a
person in this school who deals in plots that elaborate, and his
name is not Zabini. And I did warn you that there was a quadruple
agent; you knew that Zabini was at least a triple agent, and you
should have guessed a high chance that it was he. No, I will not
declare the battle invalid. All three of you failed the test, and
lost to your common enemy."</p>
<p>Harry didn't care about tests at this point. "Dumbledore
<i>blackmailed</i> Zabini by <i>threatening his cousin?</i> Just to
make our battle end in a tie? <i>Why?</i>"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gave a mirthless laugh. "Perhaps the
Headmaster thought the rivalry was good for his pet hero and wished
to see it continue. For the greater good, you understand. Or
perhaps he was simply mad. You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows that
Dumbledore's madness is a mask, that he is sane pretending to be
insane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and knowing
the secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to
them that it is <i>also</i> possible to have a mask behind the
mask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane.
And I am afraid, Mr. Potter, that I have urgent business elsewhere,
and must depart; but I should strongly advise you not to take your
cues from Albus Dumbledore when fighting a war. Until later, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>And the Defense Professor inclined his head with some irony, and
then strode off in the same direction Zabini had fled, while Harry
was still standing in open-mouthed shock.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Harry Potter.</i></p>
<p>Harry trudged slowly toward the Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing of
walls, paintings, or other students; he went up stairs and down
ramps without slowing, speeding, or noticing where he trod.</p>
<p>It had taken him more than a minute after Professor Quirrell's
departure to realize that his only source of information about
Dumbledore being involved was (a) Blaise Zabini, who he would have
to be an absolute gaping idiot to trust again, and (b) Professor
Quirrell, who could have easily faked a plot in Dumbledore's style,
and who might also think that a little student rivalry was a fine
thing; and who had, if you stepped back and blurred out the
details, just proposed turning the country into a magical
dictatorship.</p>
<p>And it was also possible that Dumbledore <i>was</i> the one
behind Zabini, and that Professor Quirrell had been sincerely
trying to fight the Dark Mark in kind, and prevent the repetition
of a performance he saw as pathetic. Trying to make sure that Harry
didn't end up fighting the Dark Lord alone, while everyone else
hid, frightened, trying to stay out of the line of fire, waiting
for Harry to save them.</p>
<p>But the truth was...</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Harry was sort of okay with that.</p>
<p>It was, he knew, the kind of thing that was supposed to make
heroes resentful and bitter.</p>
<p>To heck with that. Harry was very much in favor of everyone else
<i>staying out of danger</i> while the Boy-Who-Lived took down the
Dark Lord by himself, plus or minus a small number of companions.
If the next conflict with the Dark Lord got to the point of a
Second Wizarding War that killed lots of people and embroiled a
whole country, that would mean Harry had <i>already failed</i>.</p>
<p>And if afterward a war broke out between wizards and Muggles, it
didn't matter who won, Harry would have already failed by letting
it get that far. Besides, who said the societies couldn't
peacefully integrate when the secrecy inevitably broke down?
(Though Harry could hear Professor Quirrell's dry voice in his
mind, asking him if he was a fool, and saying all the obvious
things...) And if mages and Muggles couldn't live in peace, then
Harry would combine magic and science and figure out how to
evacuate all the wizards to Mars or somewhere, instead of letting a
war break out.</p>
<p>Because if it did come down to a war of extermination...</p>
<p>That was the thing Professor Quirrell hadn't realized, the one
most important question he'd forgotten to ask his young
general.</p>
<p>The real reason why Harry had no intention of being argued into
endorsing a Light Mark, no matter <i>how</i> much it would help him
in his fight against the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>One Dark Lord and fifty Marked followers had been a peril to all
of magical Britain.</p>
<p>If all Britain took the Mark of a strong leader, they would be a
peril to the whole magical world.</p>
<p>And if the whole wizarding world took a single Mark, they would
be a danger to the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>No one knew quite how many wizards there were in the world. He'd
done a few estimates with Hermione and come up with numbers in the
rough range of a million.</p>
<p>But there were six billion Muggles.</p>
<p>If it came down to a final war...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had forgotten to ask Harry which side he
would protect.</p>
<p>A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward,
knowing that its destiny was to grasp the stars.</p>
<p>And a magical civilization, slowly fading as knowledge was lost,
still governed by a nobility that saw Muggles as not quite
human.</p>
<p>It was a terribly sad feeling, but not one that held any hint of
doubt.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Blaise Zabini.</i></p>
<p>Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed
slowness, his heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down -</p>
<p>"Ahem," said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as he
passed.</p>
<p>Blaise jumped, but he didn't scream.</p>
<p>Slowly, he turned.</p>
<p>In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and
billowing that it was impossible to determine whether the figure
beneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed
black hat, and a black mist seemed to gather beneath it and obscure
the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.</p>
<p>"Report," whispered Mr. Hat and Cloak.</p>
<p>"I said just what you told me to," said Blaise. His voice was a
little calmer now that he wasn't lying to anyone. "And Professor
Quirrell reacted just the way you expected."</p>
<p>The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head
below had nodded. "Excellent," said the unidentifiable whisper.
"The reward I promised you is already on its way to your mother, by
owl."</p>
<p>Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive. "Can I
ask now why you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell
and Dumbledore?" The Headmaster hadn't had anything to do with the
Gryffindor bullies that Blaise knew about, and besides helping
Kimberly, the Headmaster had also offered to make Professor Binns
give him excellent marks in History of Magic even if he turned in
blank parchments for his homework, though he'd still have to attend
class and pretend to hand them in. Actually Blaise would have
betrayed all three generals for free, and never mind his cousin
either, but he'd seen no need to say that.</p>
<p>The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a
quizzical stare. "Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that
traitors who betray so many times over often meet with ill
ends?"</p>
<p>"Nope," said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under
the hat. "Everyone knows that nothing <i>really</i> bad ever
happens to students in Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Mr. Hat and Cloak gave a whispery chuckle. "Indeed," said the
whisper. "With the murder of one student five decades ago being the
exception that proves the rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have
keyed his monster into the ancient wards at a higher level than the
Headmaster himself."</p>
<p>Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little
uneasy. But it ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything
significant to him without setting off alarms. Quirrell and Snape
were the only professors who'd do something like this, and Quirrell
wouldn't care about fooling <i>himself</i>, and Snape wouldn't hurt
one of his own Slytherins... would he?</p>
<p>"No, friend Blaise," whispered the black mist, "I only wished to
advise you never to try anything like this in your adult life. So
many betrayals would certainly lead to at least one vengeance."</p>
<p>"My <i>mother</i> never got any vengeances," said Blaise
proudly. "Even though she married <i>seven</i> husbands and every
single one of them died mysteriously and left her lots of
money."</p>
<p>"Really?" said the whisper. "However did she persuade the
seventh to marry her after he heard what happened to the first
six?"</p>
<p>"I asked Mum that," said Blaise, "and she said I couldn't know
until I was old enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and
she said, older than her."</p>
<p>Again the whispery chuckle. "Well then, friend Blaise, my
congratulations on having followed in your mother's footsteps. Go,
and if you say nothing of this, we will not meet again."</p>
<p>Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn
his back.</p>
<p>The hat tilted. "Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If you were
truly the equal of Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would have
already realized that my hinted threats were just to ensure your
silence before Albus. Had I intended to harm, I would not have
hinted; had I said nothing, <i>then</i> you should have
worried."</p>
<p>Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to
Mr. Hat and Cloak; then turned decisively and strode off toward his
meeting with the Headmaster.</p>
<p>He'd been hoping to the very end that someone <i>else</i> would
show up and give him a chance to sell out Mr. Hat and Cloak.</p>
<p>But then Mum hadn't betrayed seven different husbands at the
<i>same time.</i> When you looked at it <i>that</i> way, he was
still doing better than her.</p>
<p>And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster's
office, smiling, content to be a quintuple agent -</p>
<p>For a moment the boy stumbled, but then straightened, shaking
off the odd feeling of disorientation.</p>
<p>And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster's
office, smiling, content to be a quadruple agent.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Hermione Granger.</i></p>
<p>The messenger didn't approach her until she was alone.</p>
<p>Hermione was just leaving the girl's bathroom where she
sometimes hid to think, and a bright shining cat leaped out of
nowhere and said, "Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>She let out a little shriek before she realized the cat had
spoken in Professor McGonagall's voice.</p>
<p>Even so she hadn't been frightened, only startled; the cat was
bright and brilliant and beautiful, glowing with a white silver
radiance like moon-colored sunlight, and she couldn't imagine being
scared.</p>
<p>"What are you?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"This is a message from Professor McGonagall," said the cat,
still in the Professor's voice. "Can you come to my office, and not
speak of this to anyone?"</p>
<p>"I'll be there right away," said Hermione, still surprised, and
the cat leaped and vanished; only it didn't vanish, it traveled
away somehow; or that was what her mind said, even though her eyes
just saw it disappear.</p>
<p>By the time Hermione had got to the office of her favorite
professor, her mind was all a-whirl with speculations. Was there
something wrong with her Transfiguration scores? But then why would
Professor McGonagall say not to tell anyone? It was probably about
Harry practicing his partial Transfiguration...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's face looked worried, not stern, as
Hermione seated herself in front of the desk - trying to keep her
eyes from going to the nest of cubbyholes containing Professor
McGonagall's homework, she'd always wondered what sort of work
grownups had to do to keep the school running and whether they
could use any help from her...</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, "let me start by
saying that I already know about the Headmaster asking you to make
that wish -"</p>
<p>"He <i>told</i> you?" blurted Hermione in startlement. The
Headmaster had said no one else was supposed to know!</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall paused, looked at Hermione, and gave a sad
little chuckle. "It's good to see Mr. Potter hasn't corrupted you
too much. Miss Granger, you aren't supposed to <i>admit</i>
anything just because I say I know. As it happens, the Headmaster
did <i>not</i> tell me, I simply know him too well."</p>
<p>Hermione was blushing furiously now.</p>
<p>"It's fine, Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall hastily.
"You're a Ravenclaw in your first year, nobody expects you to be a
Slytherin."</p>
<p>That <i>really</i> stung.</p>
<p>"Fine," said Hermione with some acerbity, "I'll go ask Harry
Potter for Slytherin lessons, then."</p>
<p>"That <i>wasn't</i> what I wanted to..." said Professor
McGonagall, and her voice trailed off. "Miss Granger, I'm worried
about this <i>because</i> young Ravenclaw girls shouldn't have to
be Slytherins! If the Headmaster asks you to get involved in
something you're not comfortable with, Miss Granger, it really is
all right to say no. And if you're feeling pressured, please tell
the Headmaster that you would like me to be there, or that you
would like to ask me first."</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes were very wide. "Does the Headmaster do things
that are wrong?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked a little sad at that. "Not on
purpose, Miss Granger, but I think... well, it probably <i>is</i>
true that sometimes the Headmaster has trouble remembering what
it's like to be a child. Even when he was a child, I'm sure he must
have been brilliant, and strong of mind and heart, with courage
enough for three Gryffindors. Sometimes the Headmaster asks too
much of his young students, Miss Granger, or isn't careful enough
not to hurt them. He is a good man, but sometimes his plotting can
go too far."</p>
<p>"But it's <i>good</i> for students to be strong and have
courage," said Hermione. "That's why you suggested Gryffindor for
me, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall smiled wryly. "Perhaps I was only being
selfish, wanting you for my own House. Did the Sorting Hat offer
you - no, I should not have asked."</p>
<p>"It told me I might go anywhere but Slytherin," said Hermione.
She'd <i>almost</i> asked why she wasn't good enough for Slytherin,
before she'd managed to stop herself... "So I <i>have</i> courage,
Professor!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall leaned forward over her desk. The worry was
showing plainer on her face now. "Miss Granger, it's not about
courage, it's about what's healthy for young girls! The Headmaster
is drawing you into his plots, Harry Potter is giving you his
secrets to keep, and now you're making alliances with Draco Malfoy!
And I promised your mother that you would be safe at Hogwarts!"</p>
<p>Hermione just didn't know what to say to that. But the thought
was occurring to her that Professor McGonagall might not have been
warning her if she'd been a boy in Gryffindor instead of a girl in
Ravenclaw and <i>that</i> was, well... "I'll try to be good," she
said, "and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pressed her hands over her eyes. When she
took them away, her lined face looked very old. "Yes," she said in
a whisper, "you would have done well in my House. Stay safe, Miss
Granger, and be careful. And if you are ever worried or
uncomfortable about anything, please come to me at once. I won't
keep you any longer."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:</i></p>
<p>Neither of them really wanted to do anything complicated that
Saturday, not after fighting a battle earlier. So Draco was just
sitting in an unused classroom and trying to read a book called
<i>Thinking Physics.</i> It was one of the most fascinating things
that Draco had ever read in his life, at least the parts he could
understand, at least when the <i>accursed idiot</i> who refused to
let his books out of his sight could manage to <i>shut up</i> and
let Draco <i>concentrate</i> -</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger is a <i>muuudbloood,</i>" sang Harry Potter
from where he sat at a nearby desk, reading a far more advanced
book of his own.</p>
<p>"I know what you're trying to do," said Draco calmly without
looking up from the pages. "It's not going to work. We're still
ganging up and crushing you."</p>
<p>"A <i>Maaaalfoy</i> is working with a <i>muuudbloood,</i> what
will all your father's <i>frieeeends</i> think -"</p>
<p>"They'll think Malfoys aren't as easily manipulated as
<i>you</i> seem to believe, <i>Potter!</i>"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was crazier than Dumbledore, no future
saviour of the world could ever be this <i>childish</i> and
<i>undignified</i> at any age.</p>
<p>"Hey, Draco, you know what's really going to suck? <i>You</i>
know that Hermione Granger has two copies of the magical allele,
just like you and just like me, but all your classmates in
Slytherin don't know that and <i>yooouuu're</i> not allowed to
<i>explaaaaain</i> -"</p>
<p>Draco's fingers were whitening where they gripped the book.
Being beaten and spat upon couldn't possibly require this much
self-control, and if he didn't get back at Harry soon, he was going
to do something incriminating -</p>
<p>"So what <i>did</i> you wish the first time?" said Draco.</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything, so Draco looked up from his book, and
felt a twinge of malicious satisfaction at the sad look on Harry's
face.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "A lot of people asked me that, but I don't
think Professor Quirrell would have wanted me to talk about
it."</p>
<p>Draco put a serious look on his own face. "You can talk about it
with <i>me</i>. It's probably not important compared to the other
secrets you've told me, and what else are friends for?" <i>That's
right, I'm your friend! Feel guilty!</i></p>
<p>"It wasn't really all that interesting," Harry said with
obviously artificial lightness. "Just, <i>I wish Professor Quirrell
would teach Battle Magic again next year.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry sighed, and looked back down at his book.</p>
<p>And said, after another few seconds, "Your father's probably
going to be pretty upset with you this Christmas, but if you
promise him that you'll betray the mudblood girl and wipe out her
army, everything will go back to being all right, and you'll still
get your Christmas presents."</p>
<p>Maybe if he and Granger asked Professor Quirrell extra politely
and used some of their Quirrell points, the two of them would be
allowed to do something more interesting to General Chaos than
putting him to sleep.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="36">Chapter 36</h2><h3>Status
Differentials</h3>
<p>Wrenching disorientation, that was how it felt to walk out of
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters into the rest of Earth, the world
that Harry had once thought was the only real world. People dressed
in casual shirts and pants, instead of the more dignified robes of
wizards and witches. Scattered bits of trash here and there around
the benches. A forgotten smell, the fumes of burned gasoline, raw
and sharp in the air. The ambiance of the King's Cross train
station, less bright and cheerful than Hogwarts or Diagon Alley;
the people seemed smaller, more afraid, and likely would have
eagerly traded their problems for a dark wizard to fight. Harry
wanted to cast <i>Scourgify</i> for the dirt, and <i>Everto</i> for
the garbage, and if he'd known the spell, a Bubble-Head Charm so he
wouldn't have to breathe the air. But he couldn't use his wand, in
this place...</p>
<p>This, Harry realized, must be what it felt like to go from a
First World country to a Third World country.</p>
<p>Only it was the Zeroth World which Harry had left, the wizarding
world, of Cleansing Charms and house elves; where, between the
healer's arts and your own magic, you could hit one hundred and
seventy before old age really started catching up with you.</p>
<p>And nonmagical London, Muggle Earth, to which Harry had
temporarily returned. This was where Mum and Dad would live out the
rest of their lives, unless technology leapfrogged over wizardry's
quality of life, or something deeper in the world changed.</p>
<p>Without even thinking about it, Harry's head turned and his eyes
darted behind him to see the wooden trunk that was scurrying after
him, unnoticed by any Muggles, the clawed tentacles offering quick
confirmation that, yes, he hadn't just imagined it all...</p>
<p>And then there was the other reason for the tight feeling in his
chest.</p>
<p>His parents didn't know.</p>
<p>They didn't know <i>anything</i>.</p>
<p>They didn't know...</p>
<p>"Harry?" called a thin, blonde woman whose perfectly smooth and
unblemished skin made her look a good deal younger than
thirty-three; and Harry realized with a start that it <i>was</i>
magic, he hadn't known the signs before but he could see them now.
And whatever sort of potion lasted that long, it must have been
terribly dangerous, because most witches didn't do that to
themselves, they weren't that desperate...</p>
<p>There was water gathering in Harry's eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry?</i>" yelled an older-looking man with a paunch
gathering about his stomach, dressed with ostentatious academic
carelessness in a black vest thrown over a dark grey-green shirt,
someone who would always be a professor anywhere he went, who would
certainly have been one of the most brilliant wizards of his
generation, if he'd been born with two copies of that gene, instead
of zero...</p>
<p>Harry raised his hand and waved to them. He couldn't speak. He
couldn't speak at all.</p>
<p>They came over to him, not running, but at a steady, dignified
walk; that was how fast Professor Michael Verres-Evans walked, and
Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres wasn't about to walk any faster.</p>
<p>The smile on his father's face wasn't very wide, but then his
father never was given to huge smiles; it was, at least, as wide as
Harry had ever seen it, wider than when a new grant came in, or
when one of his students got a position, and you couldn't ask for a
wider smile than that.</p>
<p>Mum was blinking hard, and she was trying to smile but not doing
a very good job.</p>
<p>"So!" said his father as he came striding up. "Made any
revolutionary discoveries yet?"</p>
<p>Of course Dad thought he was joking.</p>
<p>It hadn't hurt quite so much when his parents didn't believe in
him, back when no one <i>else</i> had believed in him either, back
when Harry hadn't <i>known</i> how it felt to be taken seriously by
people like Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>And that was when Harry realized that the Boy-Who-Lived only
existed in magical Britain, that there wasn't any such person in
Muggle London, just a cute little eleven-year-old boy going home
for Christmas.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, his voice trembling, "I'm going to
break down and cry now, it doesn't mean there was anything wrong at
school."</p>
<p>Harry started to move forward, and then stopped, torn between
hugging his father and hugging his mother, he didn't want either
one to feel slighted or that Harry loved them more than the other
-</p>
<p>"You," said his father, "are a very silly boy, Mr. Verres," and
he gently took Harry by the shoulders and pushed him into the arms
of his mother, who was kneeling down, tears already streaking her
cheek.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mum," Harry said with his voice wavering, "I'm back."
And he hugged her, amid the noisy mechanical sounds and the smell
of burned gasoline; and Harry started crying, because he knew that
nothing <i>could</i> go back, least of all him.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The sky was completely dark, and stars were coming out, by the
time they negotiated the Christmas traffic to the university town
that was Oxford, and parked in the driveway of the small,
dingy-looking old house that their family used to keep the rain off
their books.</p>
<p>As they walked up the brief stretch of pavement leading to the
front door, they passed a series of flower-pots holding small, dim
electric lights (dim since they had to recharge themselves off
solar power during the day), and the lights lit up just as they
passed. The hard part had been finding motion sensors that were
waterproof and triggered at just the right distance...</p>
<p>In Hogwarts there were real torches like that.</p>
<p>And then the front door opened and Harry stepped into their
living-room, blinking hard.</p>
<p><i>Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each
bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some
bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardcover books: science,
math, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers
of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped
up on old tissue boxes or two-by-fours, so that you can see the
back layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn't
enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and
making little heaps under the windows...</i></p>
<p>The Verres household was just as he'd left it, only with more
books, which was also just how he'd left it.</p>
<p>And a Christmas tree, naked and undecorated just two days before
Christmas Eve, which threw Harry briefly before he realized, with a
warm feeling blossoming in his chest, that of course his parents
had <i>waited</i>.</p>
<p>"We took the bed out of your room to make room for more
bookcases," said his father. "You can sleep in your trunk,
right?"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> can sleep in my trunk," said Harry.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," said his father. "What <i>did</i> they end up
doing about your sleep cycle?"</p>
<p>"Magic," Harry said, making a beeline for the door that opened
upon his bedroom, just in case Dad <i>wasn't</i> joking...</p>
<p>"That's not an explanation!" said Professor Verres-Evans, just
as Harry shouted, "<i>You used up all the open space on my
bookcases?</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry had spent the 23rd of December shopping for Muggle things
that he couldn't just Transfigure; his father had been busy and had
said that Harry would need to walk or take the bus, which had
suited Harry just fine. Some of the people at the hardware store
had given Harry questioning looks, but he'd said with an innocent
voice that his father was shopping nearby and was very busy and had
sent him to get some things (holding up a list in carefully
adult-looking half-illegible handwriting); and in the end, money
was money.</p>
<p>They had all decorated the Christmas tree together, and Harry
had put a tiny dancing fairy on top (two Sickles, five Knuts at
Gambol &amp; Japes).</p>
<p>Gringotts had readily exchanged Galleons for paper money, but
they didn't seem to have any simple way to turn larger quantities
of gold into tax-free, unsuspicious Muggle money in a numbered
Swiss bank account. This had rather spiked Harry's plan to turn
most of the money he'd self-stolen into a sensible mix of 60%
international index funds and 40% Berkshire Hathaway. For the
moment, Harry had diversified his assets a little further by
sneaking out late at night, invisible and Time-Turned, and burying
one hundred golden Galleons in the backyard. He'd always always
<i>always</i> wanted to do that anyway.</p>
<p>Some of December 24th had been spent with the Professor reading
Harry's books and asking questions. Most of the experiments his
father had suggested were impractical, at least for the moment; of
those remaining, Harry had done many of them already. ("Yes, Dad, I
checked what happened if Hermione was given a changed pronunciation
and she didn't know whether it was changed, that was the very first
experiment I did, Dad!")</p>
<p>The last question Harry's father had asked, looking up from
<i>Magical Draughts and Potions</i> with an expression of
bewildered disgust, was whether it all made sense if you were a
wizard; and Harry had answered no.</p>
<p>Whereupon his father had declared that magic was
unscientific.</p>
<p>Harry was still a little shocked at the idea of pointing to a
section of <i>reality</i> and calling it unscientific. Dad seemed
to think that the conflict between his intuitions and the universe
meant that the universe had a problem.</p>
<p>(Then again, there were lots of physicists who thought that
quantum mechanics was weird, instead of quantum mechanics being
normal and them being weird.)</p>
<p>Harry had shown his mother the healer's kit he'd bought to keep
in their house, though most of the potions wouldn't work on Dad.
Mum had stared at the kit in a way that made Harry ask whether
Mum's sister had ever bought anything like that for Grandpa Edwin
and Grandma Elaine. And when Mum still hadn't answered, Harry had
said hastily that she must have just never thought of it. And then,
finally, he'd fled the room.</p>
<p>Lily Evans probably <i>hadn't</i> thought of it, that was the
sad thing. Harry knew that other people had a tendency to not-think
about painful subjects, in the same way they had a tendency not to
deliberately rest their hands on red-hot stove burners; and Harry
was starting to suspect that most Muggleborns rapidly acquired a
tendency to not-think about their family, who were all going to die
before they reached their first century anyway.</p>
<p>Not that Harry had any intention of letting <i>that</i> happen,
of course.</p>
<p>And then it was late in the day on December 24th and they were
driving off for their Christmas Eve dinner.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The house was huge, not by Hogwarts standards, but certainly by
the standards of what you could get if your father was a
distinguished professor trying to live in Oxford. Two stories of
brick gleaming in the setting sun, with windows on top of windows
and one tall window that went up much further than glass should go,
that was going to be one huge living room...</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell.</p>
<p>There was a distant call of "Honey, can you get it?"</p>
<p>This was followed by a slow patter of approaching steps.</p>
<p>And then the door opened to reveal a genial man, of fat and rosy
cheeks and thinning hair, in a blue button-down shirt straining
slightly at the seams.</p>
<p>"Dr. Granger?" Harry's father said briskly, before Harry could
even speak. "I'm Michael, and this is Petunia and our son Harry.
The food's in the magical trunk," and Dad made a vague gesture
behind him - not quite in the direction of the trunk, as it
happened.</p>
<p>"Yes, please, come in," said Leo Granger. He stepped forward and
took the wine bottle from the Professor's outstretched hands, with
a muttered "Thank you," and then stepped back and waved at the
living room. "Have a seat. And," his head turning down to address
Harry, "all the toys are downstairs in the basement, I'm sure Herm
will be down shortly, it's the first door on your right," and
pointed toward a hallway.</p>
<p>Harry just looked at him for a moment, conscious that he was
blocking his parents from coming in.</p>
<p>"Toys?" said Harry in a bright, high-pitched voice, with his
eyes wide. "I love toys!"</p>
<p>There was an intake of breath from his mother behind him, and
Harry strode into the house, managing not to stomp too hard as he
walked.</p>
<p>The living room was every bit as large as it had looked from
outside, with a huge vaulted ceiling dangling a gigantic
chandelier, and a Christmas tree that must have been murder to
maneuver through the door. The lower levels of the tree were
thoroughly and carefully decorated in neat patterns of red and
green and gold, with a newfound sprinkling of blue and bronze; the
heights that only a grownup could reach were carelessly, randomly
draped with strings of lights and wreaths of tinsel. A hallway
extended until it terminated in the cabinetry of a kitchen, and
wooden stairs with polished metal railings stretched up toward a
second floor.</p>
<p>"Gosh!" Harry said. "This is a big house! I hope I don't get
lost in here!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Dr. Roberta Granger was feeling rather nervous as dinner
approached. The turkey and the roast, their own contributions to
the common project, were steadily cooking away in the oven; the
other dishes were to be brought by their guests, the Verres family,
who had adopted a boy named Harry. Who was known to the wizarding
world as the Boy-Who-Lived. And who was also the only boy that
Hermione had ever called "cute", or noticed at all, really.</p>
<p>The Verreses had said that Hermione was the only child in
Harry's age group whose existence their son had ever acknowledged
in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p>And it might've been jumping the gun just a little; but both
couples had a sneaking suspicion that wedding bells might be in the
offing a few years down the road.</p>
<p>So while Christmas Day would be spent, as always, with her
husband's family, they'd decided to spend Christmas Eve meeting
their daughter's possible future in-laws.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang while she was right in the middle of basting
the turkey, and she raised her voice and shouted, "<i>Honey, can
you get it?</i>"</p>
<p>There was a brief groan of a chair and its occupant, and then
there was the sound of her husband's heavy footsteps and the door
swinging open.</p>
<p>"Dr. Granger?" said an older man's brisk voice. "I'm Michael,
and this is Petunia and our son Harry. The food's in the magical
trunk."</p>
<p>"Yes, please, come in," said her husband, followed by a muttered
"Thank you" that indicated some sort of present had been accepted,
and "Have a seat." Then Leo's voice altered to a tone of artificial
enthusiasm, and said, "And all the toys are downstairs in the
basement, I'm sure Herm will be down shortly, it's the first door
on your right."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>Then a young boy's bright voice said, "Toys? I love toys!"</p>
<p>There was the sound of footsteps entering the house, and then
the same bright voice said, "Gosh! This is a big house! I hope I
don't get lost in here!"</p>
<p>Roberta closed up the oven, smiling. She'd been a bit worried
about the way Hermione's letters had described the Boy-Who-Lived -
though certainly her daughter hadn't said anything indicating that
Harry Potter was <i>dangerous;</i> nothing like the dark hints
written in the books Roberta had bought, supposedly for Hermione,
during their trip to Diagon Alley. Her daughter hadn't said much at
all, only that Harry talked like he came out of a book, and
Hermione was studying harder than she ever had in her life just to
stay ahead of him in class. But from the sound of it, Harry Potter
was an ordinary eleven-year-old boy.</p>
<p>She got to the front door just as her daughter came clattering
frantically down the stairs at a speed that didn't look safe at
all, Hermione had claimed that witches were more resistant to falls
but Roberta wasn't quite sure she believed that -</p>
<p>Roberta took in her first sight of Professor and Mrs. Verres,
who were both looking rather nervous, just as the boy with the
legendary scar on his forehead turned to her daughter and said, now
in a lower voice, "Well met on this fairest of evenings, Miss
Granger." His hand stretched back, as though offering his parents
on a silver platter. "I present to you my father, Professor Michael
Verres-Evans, and my mother, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres."</p>
<p>And as Roberta's mouth was gaping open, the boy turned back to
his parents and said, now in that bright voice again, "Mum, Dad,
this is Hermione! She's really smart!"</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" hissed her daughter. "Stop that!"</p>
<p>The boy swiveled again to regard Hermione. "I'm afraid, Miss
Granger," the boy said gravely, "that you and I have been exiled to
the labyrinthine recesses of the basement. Let us leave them to
their adult conversations, which would no doubt soar far above our
own childish intellects, and resume our ongoing discussion of the
implications of Humean projectivism for Transfiguration."</p>
<p>"Excuse us, please," said her daughter in a very firm tone, and
grabbed the boy by his left sleeve, and dragged him into the
hallway - Roberta swiveled helplessly to track them as they went
past her, the boy gave her a cheery wave - and then Hermione pulled
the boy into the basement access and slammed the door behind
her.</p>
<p>"I, ah, I apologize for..." said Mrs. Verres in a faltering
voice.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said the Professor, smiling fondly, "Harry can be a
bit touchy about that sort of thing. But I expect he's right about
us not being interested in their conversation."</p>
<p><i>Is he dangerous?</i> Roberta wanted to ask, but she kept her
silence and tried to think of subtler questions. Her husband beside
her was chuckling, as if he'd found what they'd just seen funny,
rather than frightening.</p>
<p>The most terrible Dark Lord in history had tried to kill that
boy, and the burnt husk of his body had been found next to the
crib.</p>
<p>Her possible future son-in-law.</p>
<p>Roberta had been increasingly apprehensive about giving her
daughter over to witchcraft - especially after she'd read the
books, put the dates together, and realized that her magical mother
had probably been killed at the height of Grindelwald's terror,
<i>not</i> died giving birth to her as her father had always
claimed. But Professor McGonagall had made other visits after her
first trip, to "see how Miss Granger is doing"; and Roberta
couldn't help but think that if Hermione said her parents were
being troublesome about her witching career, something would be
done to <i>fix</i> them...</p>
<p>Roberta put her best smile on her face, and did what she could
to spread some pretended Christmas cheer.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The dining room table was much longer than six people - er, four
people and two children - really needed, but all of it was draped
with a tablecloth of fine white linen, and the dishes had been
needlessly transferred to fancy serving plates, which at least were
of stainless steel rather than real silver.</p>
<p>Harry was having a bit of trouble concentrating on the
turkey.</p>
<p>The conversation had turned to Hogwarts, naturally; and it'd
been obvious to Harry that his parents were hoping that Hermione
would trip up and say more about Harry's school life than Harry had
been telling them. And either Hermione had realized this, or she
was just automatically steering clear of anything that might prove
troublesome.</p>
<p>So <i>Harry</i> was fine.</p>
<p>But unfortunately Harry had made the mistake of owling his
parents with all sorts of facts about Hermione that she hadn't told
her <i>own</i> parents.</p>
<p>Like that she was general of an army in their after-school
activities.</p>
<p>Hermione's mother had looked very alarmed, and Harry had quickly
interrupted and done his best to explain that all the spells were
stunners, Professor Quirrell was always watching, and the existence
of magical healing meant that lots of things were much less
dangerous than they sounded, at which point Hermione had kicked him
hard under the table. Thankfully Harry's father, who Harry had to
admit was better than him at some things, had announced with firm
professorial authority that he hadn't worried at all, since he
couldn't imagine children being allowed to do it if it was
dangerous.</p>
<p>That wasn't why Harry was having trouble enjoying dinner,
though.</p>
<p>...the problem with feeling sorry for yourself was that it never
took any time at all to find someone else who had it worse.</p>
<p>Dr. Leo Granger had asked, at one point, whether that nice
teacher who'd seemed to like Hermione, Professor McGonagall, was
awarding her lots of points in school.</p>
<p>Hermione had said yes, with an apparently genuine smile.</p>
<p>Harry had managed, with some effort, to stop himself from icily
pointing out that Professor McGonagall would never show favoritism
to any Hogwarts student, and that Hermione was getting lots of
points because she'd earned <i>every, single, one.</i></p>
<p>At another point, Leo Granger had offered the table his opinion
that Hermione was very smart and could have gone to medical school
and become a dentist, if not for the whole witch business.</p>
<p>Hermione had smiled again, and a quick glance had prevented
Harry from suggesting Hermione might also have been an
<i>internationally famous scientist</i>, and asking whether that
thought would've occurred to the Grangers if they'd had a
<i>son</i> instead of a <i>daughter</i>, or if it was unacceptable
either way for their offspring to do better than them.</p>
<p>But Harry was rapidly reaching his boiling point.</p>
<p>And becoming a <i>lot</i> more appreciative of the fact that his
own father had <i>always</i> done everything he could to support
Harry's development as a prodigy and <i>always</i> encouraged him
to reach higher and <i>never</i> belittled a single one of his
accomplishments, even if a child prodigy was still just a child.
Was this the sort of household he could have ended up in, if Mum
had married Vernon Dursley?</p>
<p>Harry was doing what he could, though.</p>
<p>"And she's really beating you in <i>all</i> your classes except
broomstick riding and Transfiguration?" said Professor Michael
Verres-Evans.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said with forced calm, as he cut himself another
bite of Christmas Eve turkey. "By solid margins, in most of them."
There were other circumstances under which Harry would have been
more reluctant to admit that, which was why he hadn't gotten around
to telling his father until now.</p>
<p>"Hermione has always been quite good in school," said Dr. Leo
Granger in a satisfied tone.</p>
<p>"Harry competes at the national level!" said Professor Michael
Verres-Evans.</p>
<p>"Dear!" said Petunia.</p>
<p>Hermione was giggling, and that wasn't making Harry feel any
better about her situation. It didn't seem to bother Hermione and
<i>that bothered Harry.</i></p>
<p>"I'm not embarrassed to lose to her, Dad," Harry said. Right at
this moment he wasn't. "Did I mention that she memorized all her
schoolbooks before the first day of class? And yes, I tested
it."</p>
<p>"Is that, ah, <i>usual</i> for her?" Professor Verres-Evans said
to the Grangers.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, Hermione's always memorizing things," said Dr. Roberta
Granger with a cheerful smile. "She knows every recipe in all my
cookbooks by heart. I miss her every time I make dinner."</p>
<p>Judging by the look on his father's face, Dad was feeling at
least some of what Harry felt.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Dad," Harry said, "she's getting all the advanced
material she can take, now. Her teachers at Hogwarts know she's
smart, <i>unlike her parents!</i>"</p>
<p>His voice had risen on the last three words, and even as all
faces turned to stare at him and Hermione kicked him again, Harry
knew that he'd blown it, but it was too much, just way too
much.</p>
<p>"Of course we know she's smart," said Leo Granger, starting to
look offended at the child who'd had the temerity to raise his
voice at their dinner table.</p>
<p>"You don't have the tiniest idea," said Harry, the ice now
leaking into his voice. "You think she reads a lot of books and
it's cute, right? You see a perfect report card and you think it's
good that she's doing well in class. Your daughter is the most
talented witch of her generation and the brightest star of
Hogwarts, and someday, Dr. and Dr. Granger, the fact that you were
her parents will be the only reason that history remembers
you!"</p>
<p>Hermione, who had calmly got up from her seat and walked around
the table, chose that moment to grab Harry's shirt by the shoulder
and pull him out of his chair. Harry let himself be pulled, but as
Hermione dragged him away, he said, raising his voice even louder,
"It is entirely possible that in a thousand years, the fact that
Hermione Granger's parents were dentists will be the only reason
anyone remembers dentistry!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Roberta stared at where her daughter had just dragged the
Boy-Who-Lived out of the room with a patient look upon her young
face.</p>
<p>"I'm terribly sorry," said Professor Verres with an amused
smile. "But please don't worry, Harry always talks like that.
Aren't they just like a married couple already?"</p>
<p>The frightening thing was that they <i>were.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry had been expecting a rather severe lecture from
Hermione.</p>
<p>But after Hermione pulled them into the basement access and
closed the door behind them, she'd turned around -</p>
<p>- and was smiling, genuinely so far as Harry could tell.</p>
<p>"Please don't, Harry," she said in a soft voice. "Even though
it's very nice of you. Everything's fine."</p>
<p>Harry just looked at her. "How can you stand it?" he said. He
had to keep his voice quiet, they didn't want the parents to hear,
but it rose in pitch if not in volume. "<i>How can you stand
it?</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged, and said, "Because that's the way parents
<i>should</i> be?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, his voice low and intense, "it's not, my
father <i>never</i> puts me down - well, he <i>does</i>, but never
like that -"</p>
<p>Hermione held up a single finger, and Harry waited, watching her
search for words. It took her a while before she said, "Harry...
Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick like me because I'm the
most talented witch of my generation and the brightest star of
Hogwarts. And Mum and Dad don't know that, and you'll never be able
to tell them, but they love me anyway. Which means that everything
is just the way it should be, at Hogwarts and at home. And since
they're <i>my</i> parents, Mr. Potter, <i>you</i> don't get to
argue." She was once again smiling her mysterious smile from
dinnertime, and looking at Harry very fondly. "<i>Is</i> that
clear, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded tightly.</p>
<p>"Good," said Hermione, and leaned over and kissed him on the
cheek.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The conversation had only just gotten started again when a
distant high-pitched yelp floated back to them,</p>
<p>"<i>Hey! No kissing!</i>"</p>
<p>The two fathers burst out in laughter just as the two mothers
rose up from their chairs with identical looks of horror and dashed
toward the basement.</p>
<p>When the children had been brought back, Hermione was saying in
an icy tone that she was never going to kiss Harry ever again, and
Harry was saying in an outraged voice that the Sun would burn down
to a cold dead cinder before he let her get close enough to
try.</p>
<p>Which meant that everything was just the way it should be, and
they all sat back down again to finish their Christmas dinner.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="37">Chapter 37</h2><h3>Interlude: Crossing the
Boundary</h3>
<p>It was almost midnight.</p>
<p>Staying up late was simple enough for Harry. He just hadn't used
the Time-Turner. Harry followed a tradition of timing his sleep
cycle to make sure he was awake for when Christmas Eve turned into
Christmas Day; because while he'd never been young enough to
<i>believe</i> in Santa Claus, he'd once been young enough to
doubt.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if there <i>had</i> been a mysterious
figure who entered your house in the night and brought you
presents...</p>
<p>A chill went down Harry's spine then.</p>
<p>An intimation of something dreadful approaching.</p>
<p>A creeping terror.</p>
<p>A sense of doom.</p>
<p>Harry sat bolt upright in bed.</p>
<p>He looked at the window.</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Quirrell?</i>" Harry shrieked very quietly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a slight lifting gesture, and Harry's
window seemed to fold into its frame. At once a cold gust of winter
blew into the room through the gap, along with a scant few flakes
of snow from a sky spotted with grey night-clouds, amid the black
and stars.</p>
<p>"Fear not, Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor in a normal
voice. "I have Charmed your parents asleep; they shall not wake
until I have departed."</p>
<p>"No one's supposed to know where I am!" said Harry, still
keeping the shriek quiet. "Even owls are supposed to deliver my
mail to Hogwarts, not here!" Harry had agreed to that willingly; it
would be silly if a Death Eater could win the whole war at any time
just by owling him a magically triggered hand grenade.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was grinning, from where he stood in the
backyard beyond the window. "Oh, I shouldn't worry, Mr. Potter. You
<i>are</i> well protected against locating Charms, and no blood
purist is likely to think of consulting a phone book." His grin
grew wider. "And it did take considerable effort to cross the wards
that the Headmaster put around this house - though of course anyone
who knew your address could simply wait outside and attack you the
next time you left."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Professor Quirrell for a while. "What are you
<i>doing</i> here?" Harry said finally.</p>
<p>The smile left Professor Quirrell's face. "I've come to
apologize, Mr. Potter," the Defense Professor said quietly. "I
should not have spoken to you so harshly as I -"</p>
<p>"Don't," Harry said. He looked down at the blanket that he was
clutching around his pajamas. "Just don't."</p>
<p>"Have I offended you that much?" said Professor Quirrell's quiet
voice.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. "But you <i>will</i> if you apologize."</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell, and in an instant his voice
grew stern. "Then if I am to treat you as an equal, Mr. Potter, I
should say that you have gravely violated the etiquette that holds
between friendly Slytherins. If you are not currently playing the
game against someone, you <i>must</i> not meddle in their plans
like that, not without asking them <i>before</i>. For you do not
know what their true design may be, nor what stakes they may lose.
It would mark you as their enemy, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said, in just the same quiet tone that
Professor Quirrell had used.</p>
<p>"Apology accepted," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"But," Harry said, still quietly, "you and I really must speak
further on politics, at some point."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "I know you dislike condescension,
Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>That was a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>"But it would be even more condescending," said Professor
Quirrell, "if I were not to state it clearly. You are missing some
life experience, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"And does everyone who has sufficient life experience agree with
you, then?" said Harry calmly.</p>
<p>"What good is life experience to someone who plays Quidditch?"
said Professor Quirrell, and shrugged. "I think you will change
your mind in time, after every trust you place has failed you, and
you have become cynical."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor said it as though it were the most
ordinary statement in the world, framed against the black and the
stars and the cloud-spotted sky, as one or two tiny snowflakes blew
past him in the biting winter air.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," said Harry. "Merry Christmas."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Professor Quirrell. "After all, if it is
<i>not</i> an apology, then it must be a Christmas gift. The very
first one I have ever given, in fact."</p>
<p>Harry hadn't even started yet on learning Latin so he could read
the experimental diary of Roger Bacon; and he hardly dared open his
mouth to ask.</p>
<p>"Put on your winter coat," said Professor Quirrell, "or take a
warming potion if you have one; and meet me outside, under the
stars. I shall see if I can maintain it a little longer this
time."</p>
<p>It took Harry a moment to process the words, and then he was
dashing for the coat closet.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell kept the spell of starlight going for more
than an hour, though the Defense Professor's face grew strained,
and he had to sit down after a while. Harry protested only once,
and was shushed.</p>
<p>They crossed the boundary from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day
within that timeless void where Earthly rotations meant nothing,
the one true everlasting Silent Night.</p>
<p>And just as promised, Harry's parents slept soundly all through
it, until Harry was safely back in his room, and the Defense
Professor had gone.</p>
