<h1>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</h1>
<p class="credits">by LessWrong</p>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="65">Chapter 65</h2><h3>Contagious Lies</h3>
<p>Hermione Granger had read somewhere once, that one of the keys
to staying thin was to pay attention to the food you ate, to notice
yourself eating it, so that you were satisfied with the meal. This
morning she'd made herself toast, and put butter on the toast, and
cinnamon on the butter, and it really should've been enough to get
her to <i>notice,</i> this time, the goodness that was in front of
her...</p>
<p>Without noticing the cinnamon or the butter, without noticing
the food or that she was eating, Hermione swallowed another bite of
toast, and said, "Can you try explaining that again? I'm still
completely flabbergasted."</p>
<p>"It's pretty straightforward, if you think like a Light-Side
Slytherin," said the boy that everyone else in school, excepting
only the two of them, now believed to be her true love. Harry
Potter's spoon absentmindedly stirred his breakfast cereal; he
hadn't taken many bites of it this morning, not that Hermione had
seen. "Every good thing in the world brings its own opposition into
existence. Phoenixes are no exception."</p>
<p>Hermione took another unnoticed bite out of her buttered and
cinnamoned toast, and said, "How can anyone <i>not understand</i>
that Fawkes thinks you're a good enough person to ride around on
your shoulder? He wouldn't do that with a Dark Wizard! He just
wouldn't!"</p>
<p>And she hadn't yelled at anyone about Fawkes's touch on her
<i>own</i> cheek, because she knew it wouldn't be right - that if a
phoenix touched you, you weren't supposed to brag about it, that
wasn't what a phoenix was <i>for</i>.</p>
<p>But she'd really <i>hoped</i> that it would squash the rumors
about Harry Potter going evil and Hermione Granger following him
down.</p>
<p>And it hadn't.</p>
<p>And she truly couldn't understand why not.</p>
<p>Harry ate another bite of his cereal, his eyes going distant
now, no longer meeting her own. "Think of it this way: You skip
school one day, and you lie and tell your teacher you were sick.
The teacher tells you to bring a doctor's note, so you forge one.
The teacher says she's going to call the doctor to check, so you
have to give her a fake number for the doctor, and get a friend to
pretend to be the doctor when she calls -"</p>
<p>"You did <i>what?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry looked up from his cereal then, and now he was smiling.
"I'm not saying I really <i>did</i> that, Hermione..." Then his
eyes abruptly dropped back down to his cereal. "No. Just an
example. Lies propagate, that's what I'm saying. You've got to tell
more lies to cover them up, lie about every fact that's connected
to the first lie. And if you <i>kept on</i> lying, and you <i>kept
on</i> trying to cover it up, sooner or later you'd even have to
start lying about the general laws of thought. Like, someone is
selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn't work,
and any double-blind experimental study will confirm that it
doesn't work. So if someone wants to <i>go on</i> defending the
lie, they've got to get you to disbelieve in the experimental
method. Like, the experimental method is just for merely
<i>scientific</i> kinds of medicine, not amazing alternative
medicine like theirs. Or a good and virtuous person should believe
as strongly as they can, no matter what the evidence says. Or truth
doesn't exist and there's no such thing as objective reality. A lot
of common wisdom like that isn't just <i>mistaken,</i> it's
anti-epistemology, it's <i>systematically</i> wrong. Every rule of
rationality that tells you how to find the truth, there's someone
out there who needs you to believe the opposite. If you once tell a
lie, the truth is ever after your enemy; and there's a lot of
people out there telling lies -" Harry's voice stopped.</p>
<p>"What does that have to do with Fawkes?" she said.</p>
<p>Harry withdrew his spoon from his cereal, and pointed in the
direction of the Head Table. "The Headmaster has a phoenix, right?
And he's Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot? So he's got political
opponents, like Lucius. Now, d'you think that opposition is going
to just roll over and surrender, because Dumbledore has a phoenix
and they don't? Do you think they'll admit that Fawkes is even
<i>evidence</i> that Dumbledore's a good person? Of course not.
They've got to invent <i>something</i> to say that makes Fawkes...
<i>not important.</i> Like, phoenixes only follow people who charge
straight at anyone they think is evil, so having a phoenix just
means you're an idiot or a dangerous fanatic. Or, phoenixes just
follow people who are pure Gryffindor, so Gryffindor they don't
have the virtues of other Houses. Or it just shows how much courage
a magical animal thinks you have, nothing else, and it wouldn't be
fair to judge politicians based on that. They have to say
<i>something</i> to deny the phoenix. I bet Lucius didn't even have
to make up anything new. I bet it had all been said before,
centuries ago, since the first time someone had a phoenix riding on
his shoulder, and someone else wanted people not to take that into
account as evidence. I bet by the time Fawkes came along it was
already common wisdom, it would have just seemed <i>strange</i> to
take into account who a phoenix liked or disliked. It would be like
a Muggle newspaper testing political candidates to rate their level
of scientific literacy. Every force for Good that exists in this
universe, there's someone else who benefits from people discounting
it, or fencing it into a narrow box where it can't get to
them."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione said. "Okay, I see why Lucius Malfoy doesn't
want anyone to think that Fawkes matters, but why does anyone who
<i>isn't</i> a bad guy <i>believe</i> it?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter gave a little shrug. His spoon dropped back into
his cereal, and went on stirring without a pause. "Why does any
kind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of
maturity, of sophistication, like you've seen everything and know
better. Or because putting something down feels like pushing
yourself up. Or they don't have a phoenix themselves, so their
political instinct tells them there's no advantage to be gained
from saying nice things about phoenixes. Or because being cynical
feels like knowing a secret truth that common people don't know..."
Harry Potter looked in the direction of the Head Table, and his
voice dropped until it was almost a whisper. "I think maybe that's
what <i>he's</i> getting wrong - that he's cynical about everything
else, but not about cynicism itself."</p>
<p>Without thinking, Hermione looked in the direction of the Head
Table herself, but the Defense Professor's seat was still empty, as
it had been on Monday and Tuesday; the Deputy Headmistress had
pronounced, earlier, that Professor Quirrell's classes for today
would be canceled.</p>
<p>Afterward, when Harry had eaten a few bites of treacle tart and
then left the table, Hermione looked at Anthony and Padma, who had
been coincidentally eating nearby but certainly not eavesdropping
or anything.</p>
<p>Anthony and Padma looked back at her.</p>
<p>Padma said hesitantly, "Is it just me, or has Harry Potter
started talking like a more <i>complicated</i> sort of book in the
last few days? I mean, I haven't been listening to him very long
-"</p>
<p>"It's not just you," said Anthony.</p>
<p>Hermione didn't say anything, but she was becoming increasingly
worried. Whatever had happened to Harry Potter on the day of the
phoenix, it had changed him; there was something new in him now.
Not cold, but <i>hard.</i> Sometimes she caught him staring out a
window at nothing visible, a look of grim determination on his
face. In Herbology class on Monday, a Venus Fire Trap had gone out
of control; and Harry had tackled Terry out of the way of a
fireball even as Professor Sprout had shouted a Flame-Freezing
Charm; and when Harry had risen from the floor he'd just gone back
to his place like nothing interesting had happened. And when for
once she'd gotten a better test score than Harry in their
Transfiguration exam, later that same Monday, Harry had smiled at
her as though to congratulate her, instead of gritting his teeth;
and... that had bothered her <i>a lot</i>.</p>
<p>She was getting the sense that Harry...</p>
<p>...was pulling away from her...</p>
<p>"He seems a lot <i>older</i> all of a sudden," said Anthony.
"Not like a real grownup, I can't imagine <i>Harry</i> as a
grownup, but it's like he suddenly turned into a <i>fourth-year
version</i> of... of <i>whatever</i> he is."</p>
<p>"Well," Padma said. She daintily dabbed a chocolate-flavored
scone with some scone-flavored frosting. "I think Dragon and
Sunshine had better ally during the next battle or Mr. Harry Potter
is going to <i>smash</i> us. We were allied last time, and even
then Chaos almost won -"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Anthony. "You're right, Miss Patil. Tell the Dragon
General that we want to meet with you -"</p>
<p>"No!" said Hermione. "We shouldn't <i>have</i> to gang up on
General Potter just to stand a chance. That doesn't make sense,
especially now that nobody can use Muggle things anymore. It's
still twenty-four soldiers in every army."</p>
<p>Neither Padma or Anthony said anything to that.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Knock-knock, knock-knock.</p>
<p>"Come in, Mr. Potter," she said.</p>
<p>The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the
opening into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with
one hand, and wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that
now stood in front of her desk. She'd Transfigured that chair so
often that it sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without
any wand movement or incantation or even conscious intent. Right
now, that chair had become deeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat
down he sank into it, as though the chair were hugging him.</p>
<p>Harry didn't seem to notice. There was an air of quiet
determination about the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with
hers, and not let up for a moment. "You called me?" said the
boy.</p>
<p>"I did," said Professor McGonagall. "I have two pieces of good
news for you, Mr. Potter. First - have you met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid,
at all? The groundskeeper? He was an old friend of your
parents."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated. Then, "Mr. Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got
here," Harry said. "I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of
school. He didn't say he knew my parents, though. At the time I
thought he just wanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived...
did he have some kind of hidden agenda? He didn't <i>seem</i> like
the type..."</p>
<p>"Ah..." she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts
together. "It's a long story, Mr. Potter, but Mr. Hagrid was
falsely accused of murdering a student, five decades ago. Mr.
Hagrid's wand was snapped, and he was expelled. Later, when
Professor Dumbledore became Headmaster, he gave Mr. Hagrid a place
here as Keeper of Grounds and Keys."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes watched her intently. "You said that five decades
ago was the last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were
certain that five decades ago was the last time someone heard the
Sorting Hat's secret message."</p>
<p>She felt a slight chill - even the Headmaster or Severus might
not have made that connection that quickly - and said, "Yes, Mr.
Potter. Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not
believed, and Mr. Hagrid was blamed for the resulting death.
However, the Headmaster has located the additional enchantment on
the Sorting Hat, and he has shown it to a special panel of the
Wizengamot. As a result, Mr. Hagrid's sentence has been revoked -
just this morning, in fact - and he will be allowed to acquire a
new wand." She hesitated. "We... have not yet told Mr. Hagrid of
this, Mr. Potter. We were waiting until the deed was done, so as
not to give him false hope after so long. Mr. Potter... we were
wondering if we could tell Mr. Hagrid that it was you who helped
him...?"</p>
<p>She saw the weighing look in his eyes -</p>
<p>"I remember Mr. Hagrid holding you when you were a baby," she
said. "I think he would be very happy to know."</p>
<p>She could see it, though, on Harry's face, the moment when he
decided that Rubeus wouldn't be any use to him.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. "Bad enough that someone might deduce
there was a Parselmouth in this year's crop of students," Harry
said. "I think it'd be more prudent to just keep it all as secret
as possible."</p>
<p>She remembered James and Lily, who'd never hesitated to return
the friendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that
James was the scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms
Mistress, and Rubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been
snapped...</p>
<p>"Because you don't expect him to prove useful, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>There was silence. She hadn't intended to say that out loud.</p>
<p>Sadness crossed Harry's face. "Probably," Harry said quietly.
"But I don't think he and I would get along, do you?"</p>
<p>Something seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>"Speaking of making use of people," Harry said. "It seems I'm
going to be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So
while I'm in your office, I'd like to ask that my sleep cycle be
extended to thirty hours per day. Neville Longbottom wants to start
practicing dueling, there's an older Hufflepuff who offered to
teach him, and they invited me to join. Plus there's other things I
want to learn too - and if you or the Headmaster think I should
study anything in particular, in order to become a powerful wizard
when I grow up, let me know. Please direct Madam Pomfrey to
administer the appropriate potion, or whatever it is that she needs
to do -"</p>
<p>"<i>Mr. Potter!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes gazed directly into her own. "Yes, Minerva? I know
it wasn't your idea, but I'd like to survive the use the
Headmaster's making of me. Please don't be an obstacle to
that."</p>
<p>It almost broke her. "Harry," she whispered in a bare voice,
"children shouldn't have to <i>think</i> like that!"</p>
<p>"You're right, they shouldn't," Harry said. "A <i>lot</i> of
children have to grow up too early, though, not just me; and most
children like that would probably trade places with me in five
seconds. I'm not going to pity myself, Professor McGonagall, not
when there are people out there in real trouble and I'm not one of
them."</p>
<p>She swallowed, hard, and said, "Mr. Potter, at thirty hours per
day, you'll - get <i>older,</i> you'll age faster -" <i>Like
Albus.</i></p>
<p>"And in my fifth year I'll be around the same physiological age
as Hermione," said Harry. "Doesn't seem <i>that</i> terrible."
There was a wry smile now on Harry's face. "Honestly, I'd probably
want this even if there <i>weren't</i> a Dark Lord. Wizards live
for a while, and either wizards or Muggles will probably push that
out even further over the next century. There's no reason
<i>not</i> to pack as many hours into a day as I can. I've got
things I plan to do, and 'twere well they were done quickly."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"All right," Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She
raised her voice. "All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask the
Headmaster, and if he agrees, it shall be done."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes narrowed for a moment. "I see. Then please remind
the Headmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that
if it had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn't tell
anyone else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus
stopping this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into
nothingness. That was what Albus had told her when she'd objected
that Cameron Edward was too young, and then when she'd objected
that Peter Pevensie was too young, and finally she'd given up
objecting. "Who told you that, Mr. Potter?" <i>Not Albus - surely
Albus would never</i> say <i>that to any student -</i></p>
<p>"I've been doing a lot of reading lately," Harry said. His body
started to rise from the enveloping chair, then halted. "Dare I ask
about the second piece of good news?"</p>
<p>"Oh," she said. "Ah - Professor Quirrell has woken up and says
that you may -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Hogwarts infirmary was a brilliantly open space, skylit on
all four sides despite seeming to be located squarely in the middle
of the castle. White beds in long rows stretched out, only three of
them occupied at the moment. One older boy and one older girl on
opposite sides, both lying motionless with their eyes closed,
probably unconscious and spell-bound while some healing Charm or
Potion reconfigured their bodies in uncomfortable ways; and the
third occupant had the curtain drawn around their bed, which was
presumably a good thing. Madam Pomfrey had pushed him along with a
hard shove and told him not to gawk, and Harry had needed to remind
himself sharply that some people still didn't know who the
Boy-Who-Lived was - either that, or Madam Pomfrey's identity was
bound up with her absolute dominance of her own hospital, etcetera,
whatever.</p>
<p>Behind the rows of beds were five doors, leading into the
private rooms where they stored the patients who would be staying
for days instead of hours, but whose condition didn't warrant a
transfer to St. Mungos.</p>
<p>Windowless, skyless, unlit but for a single smokeless torch on
one of the solid stone walls; that was the room behind the middle
door. Harry had wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts to
change itself; or if the infirmary always had a room like that
available, for people who didn't enjoy the light.</p>
<p>In the center of the room, between two equal bedstands that
looked to have been carved from the same grey marble as the walls,
rested a white hospital bed, looking vaguely orangish in the
unsmoking torchlight; and within that bed, a white sheet pulled up
about his thighs and wearing a hospital gown, sat Professor
Quirrell with his back slightly propped up against the headboard of
the bed.</p>
<p>There was something frightening about seeing Professor Quirrell
in one of Madam Pomfrey's beds, even if the Defense Professor
appeared uninjured. Even knowing that Professor Quirrell had
deliberately arranged his own apparent defeat at Severus's hands,
to give himself an excuse to recover his strength from Azkaban.
Harry had never <i>actually</i> watched anyone dying in a hospital
bed, but he'd seen too many movies. It was an intimation of
mortality, and the Defense Professor was <i>not</i> supposed to be
mortal.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that he was absolutely forbidden to
pester her patient.</p>
<p>Harry had said, "I understand", which technically did not say
anything about obedience.</p>
<p>The stern old healer had then turned, and started to say to
Professor Quirrell that he was absolutely not to overexert himself
or... upset himself...</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had trailed off, hurriedly turned around, and fled
the room.</p>
<p>"Not bad," Harry observed, after the door had shut behind the
escaping medical matron. "I've got to learn how to do that,
sometime."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell smiled a smile with absolutely no humor
content, and said, his voice sounding a good deal dryer than its
usual dryness, "Thank you for your artistic critique, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>Harry stared into the pale blue eyes, and thought that Professor
Quirrell looked...</p>
<p>...older.</p>
<p>It was subtle, it might have just been Harry's imagination, it
might have been the poor lighting. But the hair above Quirinus
Quirrell's forehead might have receded a bit, what remained might
have thinned and greyed, an advancing of the baldness that had
already been visible on the back of his head. The face might have
grown a little sunken.</p>
<p>The pale blue eyes had stayed sharp and intense.</p>
<p>"I am glad," Harry said quietly, "to see you in what appears to
be good health."</p>
<p>"Appearances can be deceiving, of course," said Professor
Quirrell. He gave a flick of his fingers, and when his hand
finished the gesture he was holding his wand. "Would you believe
that woman thinks she has confiscated this from me?"</p>
<p>Six incantations the Defense Professor spoke then; six of the
thirty that he had used to safeguard their important conversations
in Mary's Room.</p>
<p>Harry raised his eyebrows, silently quizzical.</p>
<p>"That is all I can manage for now," said the Defense Professor.
"I expect it shall prove sufficient. Still, there is a proverb: If
you do not wish a thing heard, do not say it. Consider it to apply
in full measure. I am told that you were trying to see me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. He paused, gathered his thoughts. "Did the
Headmaster, or anyone, tell you that we can't go to lunch any
more?"</p>
<p>"Something along those lines," said the Defense Professor. And
without changing expression, "Of course I was terribly sorry to
hear it."</p>
<p>"It's more extreme than that, actually," said Harry. "I'm
confined to Hogwarts and its grounds indefinitely. I can't leave
without a guard and a good reason. I'm not going home for summer,
and maybe not ever again. I was hoping... to speak with you, about
that."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor exhaled a breath like a brief sigh, and
said, "We shall just have to rely on the known fact that the Deputy
Headmistress will personally murder anyone who tries to report me.
Mr. Potter, I intend to keep this conversation on track so that we
may conclude it quickly, is that understood?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and -</p>
<p>In the light of the single torch, shaded toward the reddish end
of the optical spectrum, the snake's green scales were not very
reflective, and the blue-and-white banding hardly more so. Dark
seemed the snake, in that light. The eyes, which had seemed like
gray pits before, now reflected the torchlight, and seemed brighter
than the rest of the snake.</p>
<p>"<i>Sso,</i>" hissed the venomous creature. "<i>What did you
wissh to ssay?</i>"</p>
<p>And Harry hissed, "<i>Sschoolmasster thinkss that woman'ss
former Lord iss the one who sstole her from prisson</i>."</p>
<p>Harry <i>had</i> thought about it this time, and carefully,
before he had decided that he would reveal to Professor Quirrell
<i>only</i> that the Headmaster believed that; and <i>not</i> say
anything about the prophecy which had set Voldemort on Harry's
parents, nor that the Headmaster was reconstituting the Order of
the Phoenix... it was a risk, a significant risk, but Harry needed
an ally in this.</p>
<p>"<i>He believess that one iss alive?</i>" the snake finally
said. The divided, two-pronged tongue flickered rapidly from side
to side, sardonic snakish laughter. "<i>Ssomehow I am not
ssurprissed.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Yess,</i>" Harry hissed dryly, "<i>very amussing, I am
ssure. Except now am sstuck in Hogwartss for next ssix years, for
ssafety! I have decided that I will, indeed, sseek power; and
confinement iss not helpful for that. Musst convince sschoolmasster
that Dark Lord iss not yet awakened, that esscape was work of ssome
other power -</i>"</p>
<p>Again the rapid flickering of the snake's tongue; the snakish
laughter was stronger, dryer, this time. "<i>Amateur
foolisshnesss.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon?</i>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>You ssee misstake, think of undoing, ssetting time back to
sstart. Yet not even with hourglasss can time be undone. Musst move
forward insstead. You think of convincing otherss they are
misstaken. Far eassier to convince them they are right. Sso
conssider, boy: what new happensstance would make schoolmasster
decide you were ssafe once more, ssimultaneoussly advance your
other agendass?"</i></p>
<p>Harry stared at the snake, puzzled. His mind tried to comprehend
and unravel the riddle -</p>
<p>"<i>Iss it not obviouss?</i>" hissed the snake. Again the
tongue flickered sardonic laughter. "<i>To free yoursself, to gain
power in Britain, you musst again be sseen to defeat the Dark
Lord.</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed
above a white hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of
its eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Sso,</i>" Harry said finally. "<i>Let uss be clear on what
iss propossed. You ssuggesst that we sset up imposstor to
imperssonate Dark Lord."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Ssomething like that.</i> <i>Woman we resscued will
cooperate, sshould be mosst convincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss
sside.</i>" More sardonic tongue-flickering. "<i>You are kidnapped
from Hogwartss to public location, many witnesssess, wardss keep
out protectorss. Dark Lord announcess that he hass at long lasst
regained physical form, after wandering as sspirit for yearss;
ssayss that he hass gained sstill greater power, not even you can
sstop him now. Offerss to let you duel. You casst guardian Charm,
Dark Lord laughss at you, ssayss he iss not life-eater. Casstss
Killing Cursse at you, you block, watcherss ssee Dark Lord explode
-"</i></p>
<p>"<i>Casst Killing Cursse?</i>" Harry hissed in incredulity.
"<i>At me? Again? Ssecond time? Nobody will believe Dark Lord could
posssibly be that sstupid -</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>You and I are only two people in country who would notice
that,</i>" hissed the snake. "<i>Trusst me on thiss, boy.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>What if there iss third, ssomeday?</i>"</p>
<p>The snake swayed thoughtfully. "<i>Could write different sscript
for play, if you wissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave open
posssibility Dark Lord might return yet again - nation musst think
they are sstill dependent on you to protect them.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake's
eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Well?</i>" hissed the swaying form.</p>
<p>The obvious thought was that going along with the Defense
Professor's plots and deceptions a <i>second</i> time, spinning an
even <i>more</i> complicated lie to cover up the first mistake, and
creating <i>another</i> fatal vulnerability if anyone ever
discovered the truth, would be <i>exactly</i> the same sort of
stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing Curse again.
It didn't even take his Hufflepuff side to point that out, Harry
thought it in his very own mental voice.</p>
<p>But there was also a certain question as to whether the
appropriate moral to learn from the last experience was to always
say <i>no</i> immediately to the Defense Professor, or...</p>
<p>"<i>Will think about it,</i>" hissed Harry. "<i>Will not ansswer
right away, thiss time, will enumerate risskss and benefitss firsst
-</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Undersstood,</i>" hissed the snake. "<i>But remember thiss,
boy, other eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss
eassy, rarely usseful."</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The boy emerged from the private room into the main infirmary,
running nervous fingers through his messy black hair as he walked
past the white beds, occupied and unoccupied.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the boy emerged from the Hogwarts infirmary
entirely, passing Madam Pomfrey on the way out with a distracted
nod.</p>
<p>The boy walked out into a hallway, then into a larger corridor,
and then stopped and leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>The thing was...</p>
<p>...he really <i>didn't</i> want to be stuck in Hogwarts for the
next six years; and when you thought about it...</p>
<p>... the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban wasn't
<i>just</i> imposing costs on Harry. Other people would be
worrying, living in fear of the Dark Lord's return, expending
unknown resources to take unknown precautions. Harry could demand
that they write the script in such fashion as to make it seem
<i>not</i> plausible that the Dark Lord would return a third time.
And then people would relax, it would all be over.</p>
<p>Unless of course there actually <i>was</i> a Dark Lord out there
to be feared. There <i>had</i> been a prophecy.</p>
<p>The boy leaning against the wall vented a soft sigh, and started
walking again.</p>
<p>Harry had almost forgotten, but he <i>had</i> gotten around to
showing Professor Quirrell the deck of cards he'd been given on
Sunday night by 'Santa Claus', within which the King of Hearts was
allegedly a portkey that would take him to the Salem Witches'
Institute in America. Although of course Harry hadn't told
Professor Quirrell <i>who'd</i> sent him the card, nor what it was
<i>supposed</i> to do, before he'd asked Professor Quirrell if it
was possible to tell where the portkey would send him.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had transformed back to human form, and
examined the King of Hearts, tapping it a few times with his
wand.</p>
<p>And according to Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p>...the portkey would send the user somewhere in London, but he
couldn't pinpoint it any nearer than that.</p>
<p>Harry had shown Professor Quirrell the note that had accompanied
the deck of cards, saying nothing of the earlier notes.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had taken it in at a glance, given a dry
chuckle, and observed that if you read the note <i>carefully</i>,
it did not <i>explicitly</i> say that the portkey would take him to
the Salem Witches' Institute.</p>
<p>You needed to learn to pay attention to that kind of subtlety,
Professor Quirrell said, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard when
you grew up; or, indeed, if you wanted to grow up at all.</p>
<p>The boy sighed again as he trudged off to class.</p>
<p>He was starting to wonder if all the other wizarding schools
were also like this, or if it was only Hogwarts that had a
problem.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="66">Chapter 66</h2><h3>Self Actualization, Pt
1</h3>
<p><i>Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.</i></p>
<p>So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could
quibble about the details of the proverb, Harry understood the
weaknesses of Ravenclaws well enough to know that you had to try
<i>answering</i> your own quibbles. Did some plans call for
waiting? Yes, many plans called for <i>delayed action</i>; but that
was not the same as <i>hesitating</i> to <i>choose</i>. Not
delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was
necessary, but delaying because you couldn't make up your mind -
there was no cunning plan which called for that.</p>
<p>Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that
could also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be
<i>tempting</i> to delay, when you were faced with a choice between
two painful alternatives, and <i>not choosing</i> would avoid the
mental pain for a time. So you would pick a piece of information
you couldn't easily obtain, and claim that you couldn't possibly
decide without it; that would be your excuse. Although if you knew
<i>what</i> information you needed, knew <i>when</i> and <i>how</i>
you would obtain that information, and knew what you would
<i>do</i> depending on each possible observation, then that was
less suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.</p>
<p>If you <i>weren't</i> just hesitating, you ought to be able to
choose <i>in advance</i> what you would do, once you had the extra
information you claimed you needed.</p>
<p>If the Dark Lord were <i>really</i> out there, would it be smart
to go along with Professor Quirrell's plan to have someone
impersonate the Dark Lord?</p>
<p>No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And if Harry knew for a <i>fact</i> that the Dark Lord
<i>wasn't</i> really out there... in <i>that</i> case...</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's office was a small room, at least today;
it had changed since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of
the room becoming darker, more polished. Behind the Defense
Professor's desk stood the single empty bookcase that always
decorated the room, a tall bookcase stretching almost from the
floor to the ceiling, with seven empty wooden shelves. Harry had
only once seen Professor Quirrell take a book from those empty
shelves, and never seen him put a book back.</p>
<p>The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the
Defense Professor's desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at
Harry from close to his own eye level.</p>
<p>They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be
cast within Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster's
attention.</p>
<p>"<i>No,</i>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion
was conveyed by the gesture, not that Harry's Parselmouth talent
conveyed to him. "<i>Reasson not?</i>" said the green snake.</p>
<p>"<i>Too rissky,</i>" Harry said simply. That was true whether or
not the Dark Lord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in
advance had made him realize that he'd just been using the
unanswered question as an excuse to hesitate; the sane decision was
the same, either way.</p>
<p>For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a
moment the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. "<i>Think you
have learned wrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss
are not in habit of failing, and lasst one would have gone
flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss to
follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin,
tame your wild impulssess."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make
girl-child friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am
sstupid,</i>" Harry snapped back. He'd been planning a more
temporizing response than that, but somehow the words had just
slipped out.</p>
<p>The <i>sssss</i>-ing sound that came from the snake was not
heard by Harry as words, only as pure fury. A moment later, "<i>You
told them -</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at
Harry; again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered
what Professor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor
Quirrell that long to think.</p>
<p>"<i>You sserioussly care what thosse two think?</i>" came the
snake's final hiss. "<i>True younglingss thosse two are, not like
you. Could not weigh adult matterss.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Might have done better than me,</i>" Harry hissed.
"<i>Boy-child friend would have assked after ssecret motivess
before asssenting to resscue woman -</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Glad you undersstand that now,</i>" the snake hissed coldly.
"<i>Alwayss assk after other'ss advantage. Next learn to alwayss
assk after your own. If my plan iss not to your tasste, what iss
yours?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>If necesssary - sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy.
Hogwartss sseemss fine place to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange
but tassty food.</i>" Harry wanted to chuckle, but there wasn't any
gesture in Parseltongue for the kind of laughter he wanted to
express.</p>
<p>The pits of the snake's eyes seemed almost black. "<i>Eassy to
ssay that now. Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate
imprissonment. You will losse patience long before sseventh year,
perhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall plan
accordingly.</i>"</p>
<p>And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, the
human-shape of Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once
more. "So, Mr. Potter," said the Defense Professor, his voice as
calm as if they had been discussing nothing important, as if the
whole conversation had not occurred at all, "I hear that you have
begun to practice dueling. Not the worthless sort with
<i>rules</i>, I hope?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her
(except on the day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had
escaped, which shouldn't ought to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff
girl had come over to the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped
Hermione on her shoulder, and very nearly dragged her away -</p>
<p>"Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr.
Diggory!" Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from
the table.</p>
<p>"Who?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"<i>Cedric Diggory!</i>" said Hannah. "He's the Captain of our
Quidditch Team, and general of an army, and he's taking <i>all</i>
the electives and getting better grades than anyone, and I hear he
learns dueling from professional tutors during the summers, and he
once beat <i>two</i> seventh-year students, and even some teachers
call him the Super Hufflepuff, and Professor Sprout says we should
all emu, uh, emudate him or something like that, and -"</p>
<p>After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a
while), Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.</p>
<p>"Sunshine Soldier Abbott!" said Hermione. "Calm <i>down</i>.
We're not going to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure,
Neville's studying to beat us, but we can study too -"</p>
<p>"Don't you <i>see?</i>" Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a
lot louder then it should've been, if they were trying to keep the
conversation private from all the Ravenclaws looking at them.
"Neville isn't studying to beat <i>us!</i> He's practicing so he
can fight <i>Bellatrix Black!</i> They're going to go through us
like a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!"</p>
<p>The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. "Listen," said
Hermione, "I don't think a few weeks of practice is going to make
anyone an invincible fighter. Plus we already <i>know</i> how to
handle invincible fighters. We'll concentrate fire on them and
they'll go down just like Draco."</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration and
skepticism. "Aren't you even, you know, <i>worried?</i>"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>honestly!</i>" said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard
being the only sensible person in your whole school year. "Haven't
you ever heard the saying, the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Hannah. "That's crazy, what about
Lethifolds lurking in the darkness, and being put under the
Imperius Curse, and horrible Transfiguration accidents and -"</p>
<p>"I <i>mean,</i>" said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into
her now-raised voice, she'd been hearing this sort of thing <i>all
week</i> now, "how about if we wait until <i>after</i> the Chaos
Legion <i>actually</i> crushes us to get so scared of them and
<i>did you just mutter 'Gryffindors' under your voice?</i>"</p>
<p>A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at
the table with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it
wasn't the terrible cold glare of Harry's dark side but it was the
scariest face <i>she</i> knew how to make.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was going <i>down.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"This is loony," gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath
he could spare from being completely out of breath.</p>
<p>"This is <i>brilliant!</i>" said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of
the Super Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like
the sweat on his forehead as he stamped his feet through the dance
of one of his dueling postures. His usually-light steps had changed
to heavier stomps, which might have had something to do with the
Transfigured metal weights they'd all attached to their arms and
legs and strapped over their chests. "Where do you <i>get</i> these
ideas, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"A strange old shop... in Oxford... and I'm never... shopping
there... again." <i>Thud.</i></p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="67">Chapter 67</h2><h3>Self Actualization, Pt
2</h3>
<p>In the high reaches of Hogwarts where rooms and corridors
changed on a daily basis, where the territory itself was uncertain
and not just the map, where the stability of the castle began to
fray into dreams and chaos without changing its architectural style
or apparent solidity - in the high reaches of Hogwarts, a battle
would soon be fought.</p>
<p>The presence of so many students would stabilize the corridors
for a time, by dint of constant observation. The rooms and
corridors of Hogwarts sometimes <i>moved</i> even while people
looked directly at them, but they wouldn't <i>change</i>. Even
after eight centuries, Hogwarts was still a little shy about
changing in front of people.</p>
<p>But despite that transient permanence (the Defense Professor had
said) the upper reaches of Hogwarts still had a military realism:
you had to learn the ground anew each time, and check every closet
for secret corridors all over again.</p>
<p>Sunday it was, Sunday the first of March. Professor Quirrell had
recovered enough to supervise battles once more, and they were all
catching up on the backlog.</p>
<p>The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses he held
in either hand. One compass was the color of the Sun, the other had
a multicolored, iridescent sheen to indicate Chaos. The other two
generals, Draco knew, had been given their own compasses; only
Hermione Granger's hand, and Harry Potter's hand, would hold a
compass that was orange-red and flickered in its reflections like
fire, pointing always to the direction of the largest active
contingent of Dragon Army.</p>
<p>Without those compasses they might have searched for days and
never found each other, which was a territorial hazard of fighting
in the upper levels of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Draco had a bad feeling about what would happen when Dragon Army
found the Chaos Legion. Harry Potter had changed since Bellatrix
Black had escaped; the Heir of Slytherin had begun to seem truly
Lordly now (and how had Professor Quirrell known that would
happen?) Draco would have felt a lot better with Hermione Granger
standing alongside him with her twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers in
tow, but no, the Sunshine General was being stupidly proud and
refusing to accept aid against General Potter. She wanted to take
down Potter herself, she'd told him.</p>
<p>The Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy had maintained their
influence over Britain for centuries by understanding that you
couldn't always be <i>the</i> most powerful. Sometimes another Lord
was just stronger, and you had to settle for <i>merely</i> being
his foremost lieutenant. You could build up <i>quite</i> a position
of wealth and power over a dozen generations of being second in
command. You just had to be careful, each time, not to let your
House be dragged down with the fall of the Lord you served. That
was the Malfoy tradition which centuries of experience had
honed...</p>
<p>And so Father had thoroughly explained to Draco that if he ran
into someone who was obviously stronger than him, Draco was
<i>not</i> to resent this and <i>not</i> to deny it and <i>not</i>
to throw a tantrum that could sabotage his potential position, but
Draco <i>was</i> to make sure that his place in the next
generation's power structure wasn't any lower than second.</p>
<p>Granger, apparently, had never gotten this lecture from her own
parents, and was still in denial about the obvious fact that Harry
Potter was becoming stronger than her.</p>
<p>So Draco had secretly met with Captain Goldstein and Captain
Bones and Captain Macmillan and they'd agreed to all do their best
to make sure that Dragon and Sunshine didn't engage each other
before they engaged the larger threat of Chaos.</p>
<p>It wasn't <i>really</i> violating the agreement against
traitors, you weren't soliciting traitors if you honestly meant to
<i>help</i> the other army.</p>
<p>A high ringing tone belled through the corridors to signal the
start of the battle, and a moment later Draco shouted "<i>Go!</i>"
and the Dragons started running. It would tire his soldiers, it
would cost them something even after they stopped and caught their
breath, but they <i>had</i> to put Chaos directly between
themselves and the Sunshine Regiment.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the
corridors, Harry watching the yellow-golden compass that pointed
toward the location of the Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a
lookout just in case they ran into someone else.</p>
<p>Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened
closely.</p>
<p>"So," the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. "That's why you
had us practice dueling with all that weight strapped on?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to
Sunshine; if the apparent direction started to change quickly then
they were getting close.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to say anything in front of the others, but a
couple of weeks isn't a lot of time to put on extra muscle," said
Neville. "And the balance is different, and I think this weighs
<i>more</i> actually, and doesn't this count as Transfiguring a
Muggle artifact?"</p>
<p>"Nope," Harry said. "I checked that in advance. You can see it
in Hogwarts statues, so some wizards <i>used</i> to wear it, even
if they were just being fashionable for the Dark Ages." And since
nobody would ever try this if they <i>weren't</i> fighting
first-year students using weak spells like the Sleep Hex, it didn't
count as giving away good ideas, either.</p>
<p>They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor
bent in quite the right way to take them on a direct intercept
course toward where Sunshine would go as they followed the Chaos
Legion following Dragon Army. So Harry chose what seemed like the
better of the two options, and Neville followed.</p>
<p>"We'd better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we
get close," Neville said. "It's kind of noisy, they might figure it
out."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and then said "Good idea" in case Neville hadn't
been looking at him.</p>
<p>They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upper
reach of Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass,
now and then passing statues of witches and dragons and even the
occasional wizard-knight in plate armor or chainmail.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Sunshine Soldiers were striding through a long, wide
corridor with their wands out and pointed. They couldn't use the
Prismatic Shield while they were maneuvering, but Parvati Patil and
Jenny Rustad were currently maintaining <i>Contegos</i> around the
officer group, who would be the first targets of any ambush.</p>
<p>Their tactic for the next battle, she and her officers had
decided, would be to mix directly in with the enemy soldiers as
fast as possible - after having practiced among <i>themselves</i>
how to support one another, avoid hitting each other, and get into
positions where enemy soldiers would hesitate to fire. They'd only
gotten in four hours practice, but she thought her troops would
already be better at that kind of mixed-in fighting than soldiers
who hadn't practiced at all. It seemed like the sort of tactic
Chaos would use, but they hadn't actually used it yet.</p>
<p>It was a good strategy, she believed. And yet still, no matter
how much she'd lectured her soldiers, they'd persisted in
whispering fearful rumors about what Harry and Neville were
learning to do. Finally she'd gone off and talked with Captain
Goldstein, who understood things like Troop Morale, and Anthony had
suggested -</p>
<p>"That's weird," Captain Macmillan spoke up suddenly, frowning at
the fiery and iridescent compasses he held in either hand. (Ernie
was, as Harry would have termed it, "good at spatial
visualization", and so had been designated to hold both compasses
and try to figure out what their enemies were doing.) "I think...
Dragon's not moving fast anymore... I think they got on the other
side of Chaos from us first... and it looks like Chaos is moving to
attack them instead of trying to maneuver out from in between?"</p>
<p>Hermione frowned, trying to understand, and she saw similar
frowns on the faces of Anthony and Ron. If Chaos and Dragon
attacked each other straight out, and spent all their forces
fighting each other, that was practically conceding the battle to
Sunshine...</p>
<p>"Potter thinks we're allied so he's attacking Malfoy now, before
Dragon can link up with us," said Blaise Zabini from the common
ranks of soldiers. "Or Potter just thinks he can beat both armies
in a row, if he attacks them separately." The Slytherin boy gave a
condescending sigh. "Are you going to promote me back to officer
now? You lot are hopeless without me, you know."</p>
<p>They all ignored the talking noises coming from Zabini's
mouth.</p>
<p>"We still moving in the right direction?" said Anthony.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Ernie.</p>
<p>"We getting close to them?" said Ron.</p>
<p>"Not yet -"</p>
<p>That was when the huge black-wooden doors at the end of the
corridor flew open and crashed into the wall, revealing two figures
almost completely enveloped in grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched
over the faces beneath the grey hoods, one of those figures already
raising a wand and pointing it directly at her.</p>
<p>And then the face of the game changed drastically, as Harry's
voice, high and strained with the effort, screamed the word:</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, she was so shocked
that she didn't start to move until almost too late, as the red jet
of light <i>smashed</i> right through the <i>Contego</i> shield to
their front and she just barely dodged, there was a tingle on her
arm as the red light went past her, and she saw out of the corner
of her eye Susan getting hit and blown off her feet into Ron -</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium!</i>" bellowed Anthony's voice, followed a moment
later by a dozen voices crying "<i>Somnium!</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione frantically pushed herself to her feet, and as she
rose, she saw the two figures in the grey cloaks just standing
there.</p>
<p>You couldn't <i>see</i> Sleep Hexes, the spell was too weak
-</p>
<p>But there was no way they all could've <i>missed</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>" shrieked the voice of Neville Longbottom, and
another red jet shot at her, she fell in an undignified heap as she
desperately twisted out of the way, and when she scrambled up,
panting, she saw that this time the stunbolt had gotten Ron where
he'd been rising from the ground.</p>
<p>"Hello there, Sunshine," said Harry's voice from beneath his
hood.</p>
<p>"We're the Grey Knights of Chaos," said Neville's voice.</p>
<p>"We'll be your opponents for this battle," said Harry's voice,
"while Chaos's <i>other</i> army slaughters the Dragons."</p>
<p>"And by the way," said Neville's voice, "we're invincible."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over
their faces, stood facing Sunshine's entire army, seemingly unfazed
by a dozen Sleep Hexes.</p>
<p>Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head
turned she saw that Hannah's lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff
girl's eyes were huge, and she was staring at -</p>
<p>It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts that
flashed through Daphne's mind as she realized that Hannah was
staring at Neville rather than Harry, which in turn seemed to
trigger some part of her into noticing that in point of fact
Neville <i>had</i> been getting pretty interesting lately as boys
went, in fact right now the Last Scion of Longbottom was seeming
downright <i>cool,</i> and something woke up inside her and her own
lips parted and everything the Lady her Mother had ever instructed
her about demure demeanors and flattery and scented shampoo blew
straight out of her mind so hard it should have fluffed her hair
about her ears, because she'd watched Hermione and Harry and she
knew how she wanted <i>her</i> own courtship to go -</p>
<p>Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells
it might be embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble
and Most Ancient House of Greengrass.</p>
<p>Daphne's wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted
"<i>Tonare!</i>"</p>
<p>The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation
"<i>Ravum Calvaria!</i>"</p>
<p>And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked,
"<i>Lucis Gladius!</i>"</p>
<p>The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she
bore it, and when the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized
the drain was a little less.</p>
<p>Still, she had a feeling she'd better not try to fight with this
for long.</p>
<p>That everyone was staring at her went <i>quite</i> without
saying, and she <i>should</i> have leaped forward to confront
Neville with her hair billowing around her, but it was all she
could do to walk forward steadily to level her Most Ancient Blade
at Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved aside and made way for
her also went without saying.</p>
<p>"<i>I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Greengrass!</i>" she cried. "<i>Greengrass of Sunshine!</i>" The
dueling forms had gone completely out of her mind, she'd seen
enough plays to remember death challenges and blood challenges but
she couldn't remember at all what was appropriate for this, so she
just pointed the incandescent sword toward the object of her crush
and yelled, "<i>Let's see what you got, Nevvy!</i>"</p>
<p>Once again Harry's voice shrieked "<i>Stupefy!</i>", and later
on, when she was remembering this, she could never quite believe
she'd managed to do it, but she slashed out with her blade of light
like it was a Beater's bat, and <i>hit the stunbolt back at
Harry</i> who just barely managed to twist out of the way.</p>
<p>"<i>Tonare!</i>" shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most Ancient
House of Longbottom. "<i>Ravum Calvaria, Lucis Gladius!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>For a few seconds, no one did anything but stare at Neville and
Daphne as they started whacking at each other. They were both
moving slowly, and Hermione guessed that the spell was taking a lot
of strength out of them. It wasn't very impressive by comparison,
if you were a Muggleborn and you'd watched certain movies.</p>
<p>But you still had to give them extra credit for using
lightsabers at all.</p>
<p>"Point of order," said Harry's voice. "I know the Defense
Professor is watching, but I still have to ask, does anyone know
whether they'll slice each other in half if they actually hit
-"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said absently. This had been in one of her
history books, though she'd had no idea the magical dueling sword
looked like <i>that</i>. "They cast it so it'll only stun if it
touches."</p>
<p>"You <i>know</i> that spell?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it's the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, it's only
legal for Noble and Most Ancient Houses to use -"</p>
<p>Hermione stopped talking and looked at Harry, or Harry's grey
hood rather.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry's voice, "I guess I could take down the rest
of the Sunshine Regiment by myself, then." She couldn't see his
face, but his voice sounded like he was smiling.</p>
<p>"You dodged when Daphne hit your own spell back at you,"
Hermione said. "So whatever you did, you're <i>not</i> invincible.
A <i>Stupefy</i> can still get you."</p>
<p>"Interesting theory," said Harry's voice from beneath the hood.
"Got anyone in your army who can test it?"</p>
<p>"I read about the Stunning Hex once," said Hermione. "A few
months ago. I wonder if I can remember the instructions right?" Her
wand came up to point at Harry.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause, as nearby a boy and a girl breathing
in audible gasps slowly whacked at each other with lightsabers.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said, leveling his own wand on her, "<i>I</i>
can just use Somnium on you. That'll take a lot less effort."</p>
<p>New <i>Contego</i> shields sprung into existence in front of
her, cast by Jenny and Parvati, even as Harry spoke.</p>
<p>The tip of Hermione's own wand began making small motions in the
air, a diamond within a circle, a diamond within a circle,
rehearsing the gesture to match exactly what she remembered seeing
in the book. It would be a difficult feat even for her, but she
<i>had</i> to cast the spell right on the first try, she couldn't
afford any failed castings that would sap her energy.</p>
<p>"You know," said Hermione Granger, "I understand that it's not
really your fault, but I'm getting tired of hearing people talk
about the Boy-Who-Lived like you're - like you're some kind of
<i>god</i> or something."</p>
<p>"Same here, I must say," said Harry Potter. "It's sad how people
keep underestimating me."</p>
<p>Her wand kept rehearsing the diamond within the circle, over and
over. Harry would be recharging his own strength, she knew, even as
she practiced as much as she could before her attack. "I'm starting
to think you need taking down a peg, General Chaos."</p>
<p>"You could be right," Harry said equably. His feet began to
shuffle through what she recognized as a duelist's dance.
"Unfortunately there's nothing left that can defeat me now except
another Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Let me be specific, Mr. Potter. <i>I'm</i> taking you down a
peg."</p>
<p>"You and what other army?"</p>
<p>"You think you're pretty cool, don't you," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Why, yes," said Harry. "Yes, I do. Some might call that
arrogant, but am I supposed to be the last person in Hogwarts to
notice how awesome I am?"</p>
<p>Hermione raised her left hand into the air, and made a fist.</p>
<p>It was a signal. Eight designated soldiers in her army would be
pointing their wands at her, and quietly casting <i>Wingardium
Leviosa</i>.</p>
<p>They'd practiced <i>this,</i> too, once Hermione had given up on
lecturing her soldiers, and at Anthony's suggestion, tried giving
them a Sunshine General who <i>looked</i> like she could defeat
invincible enemies.</p>
<p>"You pretend you're Superman," said Hermione. She raised her
left fist higher in the air, and the eight soldiers supporting her
Hovered her off the ground. "<i>Well here's Super Hermione!</i>"
Her hand pushed forward, and as she shot rapidly through the air
toward Harry, regretting only that she couldn't see the look on his
face, her wand made a diamond within a circle and she summoned up
all the magic she could, it felt like she imagined touching a live
wire would feel as the too-powerful spell poured through her when
her voice screamed "<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>The red bolt burst from her wand, perfectly formed.</p>
<p>Harry dodged it.</p>
<p>And then, because they hadn't practiced doing this part inside
of hallways, she crashed into a wall.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Somnium!</i>" shrieked Draco, and then after only a few
seconds to recharge, "<i>SOMNIUM, CURSE YOU!</i>"</p>
<p>He <i>knew</i> he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn't
even trying to dodge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly
as his father and leveled his wand -</p>
<p>Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said
"<i>Somnium!</i>" but Draco was getting winded, he couldn't keep
this up, Theodore wasn't bothering to dodge at all while Draco had
to keep moving, this was <i>crazy.</i></p>
<p>He had enough strength now to fire again, but -</p>
<p><i>Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different
result,</i> Harry had said, this was <i>Harry's</i> work somehow,
it couldn't be a Muggle artifact anymore but Draco couldn't figure
out what it <i>could</i> be, and he should be thinking of
hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy frantically
dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex at him,
Draco felt a little numbness in his side that time as he twisted,
that had been a very very near miss and finally Draco couldn't take
it anymore, he didn't bother working out what theory he was testing
or why as he just -</p>
<p>"<i>Luminos!</i>" shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in red
light, "<i>Dulak!</i>" and it went out again (so Theodore
<i>was</i> still being affected by magic), "<i>Expelliarmus!</i>"
and Theodore's wand went flying (that had been a good spell to cast
anyway now that Draco realized it) but Theodore was rushing toward
Draco with his arms outstretched to grapple so Draco yelled
"<i>Flipendo!</i>" and the other boy's feet were abruptly yanked
up -</p>
<p>- and Theodore's back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud
and <i>metallic</i>-sounding crash.</p>
<p>Draco's vision was swimming now from casting four spells in such
fast succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet,
so there wasn't even time to think in words, but Draco still
managed to say "<i>Somnium!</i>" and <i>this</i> time he aimed for
Theodore's face instead of the chest.</p>
<p>Theodore dodged (he <i>dodged!</i>) and the boy shouted "<i>Code
seven on Malfoy!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Prismatis!</i>" cried Padma's voice and there was suddenly
a shimmering rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four Chaotic
voices cried "<i>Somnium!</i>"</p>
<p>And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge Prismatic
Sphere protecting the remnants of Dragon Army.</p>
<p>Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees,
but he looked up and managed to say, as clearly as he could, "If
the Sleep Hex - doesn't work - aim for the face - I think the
Lieutenants are wearing metal shirts."</p>
<p>"You've already lost too many soldiers," Finnigan said loudly
from across the barrier, "we'll beat you anyway," and then the
Gryffindor boy laughed evilly. He did the evil laughter almost as
well as Harry Potter by now, and the other Chaotic Legionnaires
started laughing with him soon afterward.</p>
<p>Draco could see from the corner of his eye where Gregory and
Vincent lay unconscious. Padma was still sustaining the Prismatic
Sphere, the largest one he'd ever seen her cast; but she was
breathing hard, still visibly sweaty from when they'd all jogged to
get into position, the Ravenclaw girl was a strong witch but not an
<i>athletic</i> one.</p>
<p>He really hoped General Granger got here soon and hit Chaos from
behind. General Potter and Neville of Chaos were missing, and Draco
could guess where they'd gone, but two soldiers couldn't delay the
whole Sunshine Regiment for too long all by themselves, could
they?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>She knew it wasn't fair, that the other girl had given all she
could, but Hermione still wished that Daphne had lasted longer.</p>
<p>"<i>Lagann!</i>" said Neville's voice from behind her as she
flew, and there was the sound of a Prismatic Wall shattering,
Hannah's voice desperately cried "<i>Somnium!</i>" and then a few
moments later Neville's voice calmly said "Somnium" and there was
the thud of another of her soldiers falling over.</p>
<p>And the force keeping her in the air diminished again, Hermione
could feel the grab of the Hover Charms straining at her, but now
it just wasn't enough.</p>
<p>Her flight stopped and she began falling in slow motion toward
the ground, and she should've signaled her soldiers to just
<i>drop</i> her, but she was too angry and confused and not
thinking fast enough and still trying to muster the strength for
one last Stunning Hex, and so there was nowhere to go when Harry
pointed his wand at her and said "<i>Somnium</i>" and that was the
last word that Hermione Granger heard of her battle.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="68">Chapter 68</h2><h3>Self Actualization, Pt
3</h3>
<p>Hermione wasn't feeling very nice right now, or Good either,
there was a hot ball of anger burning inside her and she wondered
if this was something like Harry's darkness (though it probably
wasn't even close) and she shouldn't have felt that way over some
silly little game but -</p>
<p>Her whole army. Two soldiers had beaten her whole army. That was
what she'd been told after she woke up.</p>
<p>It was a little too much.</p>
<p>"Well," Professor Quirrell said. From up close the Defense
Professor didn't look quite as healthy as he had the last time
she'd been in his office; his skin looked paler, and he moved a
little slower. His expression was as stern as ever, and his gaze as
penetrating; his fingers tapped sharply on his desk, rap-rap. "I
would guess that of the three of you, only Mr. Malfoy has guessed
why I've asked you here."</p>
<p>"Something to do with Noble and Most Ancient Houses?" said Harry
from beside her, sounding puzzled. "I didn't violate some kind of
crazy law by firing on Daphne, did I?"</p>
<p>"Not quite," the man said with heavy irony. "Since Miss
Greengrass did not invoke the correct dueling forms, she is not
entitled to demand that you be stripped of your House name.
Although of course I would not have permitted a formal duel. Wars
do not respect such rules." The Defense Professor leaned forward
and rested his chin on steepled hands, as though sitting upright
had already tired him. His eyes gazed at them, sharp and dangerous.
"General Malfoy. Why did I call you here?"</p>
<p>"General Potter against the two of us isn't a fair fight
anymore," Draco Malfoy said in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" blurted Hermione. "We almost <i>had</i> them, if
Daphne hadn't fainted -"</p>
<p>"Miss Greengrass did not faint from magical exhaustion,"
Professor Quirrell said dryly. "Mr. Potter shot her in the back
with a Sleep Hex while your soldiers were distracted by the sight
of their general flying into a wall. But congratulations
nonetheless, Miss Granger, on <i>almost</i> defeating two Chaotic
Legionnaires with a mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers."</p>
<p>The blood flaming in her cheeks grew a little hotter. "That -
that was just - if I'd only figured out he was wearing armor -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gazed at her from over touched fingers. "Of
course there are ways you <i>could</i> have won, Miss Granger.
There always are, in every lost battle. The world around us redunds
with opportunities, explodes with opportunities, which nearly all
folk ignore because it would require them to violate a habit of
thought; in every battle a thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting to be
sharpened into spears. If you had thought to try a massed <i>Finite
Incantatem</i> on general principles, you would have dispelled Mr.
Potter's suit of chainmail and everything else he was wearing
except his underwear, which leads me to suspect that Mr. Potter did
not quite realize his own vulnerability. Or you could have had your
soldiers swarm Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom and physically wrest
the wands from their hands. Mr. Malfoy's own response was not what
I would term <i>well-reasoned,</i> but at least he did not wholly
ignore his thousand alternatives." A sardonic smile. "But you, Miss
Granger, had the misfortune to remember how to cast the Stunning
Hex, and so you did not search your excellent memory for a dozen
easier spells that might have proved efficacious. And you pinned
all your army's hopes on your own person, so they lost spirit when
you fell. Afterward they continued to cast their futile Sleep
Hexes, governed by the habits of fighting that had been trained
into them, unable to break the pattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot
quite comprehend what goes through people's minds when they repeat
the same failed strategy over and over, but apparently it is an
astonishingly rare realization that you can try something else. And
so the Sunshine Regiment was wiped out by two soldiers." The
Defense Professor grinned mirthlessly. "One perceives certain
similarities to how fifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical
Britain, and how our much-loved Ministry continues in its
rule."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor sighed. "<i>Nonetheless,</i> Miss Granger,
the fact remains that this is not the first such defeat for you. In
the previous battle, you and Mr. Malfoy united your forces, and yet
you were fought to a standstill, so that you and Mr. Malfoy had to
pursue Mr. Potter onto the roof. The Chaos Legion has now
demonstrated, twice in succession, military strength equal to both
other armies combined. This leaves me no choice. General Potter,
you will select eight soldiers from your army, including at least
one Chaotic Lieutenant, to be divided among Dragon Army and the
Sunshine Regiment -"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" Hermione burst out again, she glanced over at
the other generals and saw that Harry looked as shocked as her,
while Draco Malfoy only looked resigned.</p>
<p>"General Potter is stronger than both of you together,"
Professor Quirrell said with calm precision. "Your contest is over,
he has won, and it is time to rebalance the three armies to present
him with a renewed challenge."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Quirrell!</i>" said Harry. "I didn't -"</p>
<p>"This is my decision as the Professor of Battle Magic at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is not subject to
negotiation." The words were still precise, but the look in
Professor Quirrell's eyes chilled Hermione's blood, even though he
was glaring at Harry and not at her. "And I find it
<i>suspicious</i>, Mr. Potter, that the moment you wished to
isolate Miss Granger and Mr. Malfoy and force them to chase you
onto the roof, you were able to annihilate just exactly as much of
their united force as you pleased. Indeed, that is the level of
performance I <i>expected</i> of you since the start of this year,
and I am <i>annoyed</i> to discover that you have been holding back
in my classes this entire time! I have seen what you can truly do,
Mr. Potter. You are far beyond the point where Mr. Malfoy or Miss
Granger can fight you on an equal level, and you will not be
permitted to pretend otherwise. This, Mr. Potter, I tell you in my
capacity as your professor: For you to learn to your full
potential, you must exercise your full abilities and not hold back
for <i>any</i> reason - particularly not childish frets over what
your friends might think!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>She left the Defense Professor's office with a larger army, and
less dignity, and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just
been squished, and trying very very hard not to cry.</p>
<p>"I <i>wasn't</i> holding back!" Harry said as soon as they
turned the first corner away from Professor Quirrell's office, the
moment the wooden door faded out of sight behind the stone walls.
"I wasn't pretending, I never <i>let</i> either of you win!"</p>
<p>She didn't answer, couldn't answer, it would all break loose if
she tried to say a word.</p>
<p>"Really?" said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that
air of resignation. "Because Quirrell's right, you know, it's
<i>suspicious</i> that you could beat nearly everyone in both our
armies as soon as you wanted to make us chase you onto the roof.
And didn't you say something then, Potter, about us needing to beat
you when you were fighting for real?"</p>
<p>The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when it
reached her eyes she would burst into tears, and from then on she
would be just a crying little girl to both of them.</p>
<p>"That -" Harry's voice said urgently, she wasn't looking at him
but his voice sounded like he had his head turned toward her. "That
was - I tried a lot harder that time, there was an important
reason, I <i>had</i> to, so I used a whole bunch of tricks I'd been
saving up - and -"</p>
<p>She'd always been trying her hardest, every time.</p>
<p>"- and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn't usually use for
something like Defense class -"</p>
<p>So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it
<i>really</i> mattered, he could just go into his dark side and
crush her, was that it?</p>
<p>...of course it was. She couldn't even <i>look</i> Harry in the
eyes when he was being scary, how had she ever thought she could
beat him for real?</p>
<p>The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left
toward a staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went
right instead, she didn't even know where that passage went but
right now she'd rather be lost in the castle.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Draco," said Harry's voice, and then there was a
pattering of footsteps behind her.</p>
<p>"Leave me alone," she said, it came out sounding stern but then
she had to shut her mouth and press her lips together tightly and
hold her breath to stop it all from coming out.</p>
<p>That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himself
in front of her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry
said, his voice now a high and desperate whisper, "I didn't run
away when <i>you</i> were beating <i>me</i> in all my classes
except broomstick riding!"</p>
<p>He didn't understand, and he would never understand, Harry
Potter would never understand, because no matter what contest he
lost he would still be the Boy-Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter
and Hermione Granger was beating you then it meant everyone was
expecting you to rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione
Granger and Harry Potter was beating you that meant you were just
no one.</p>
<p>"It's not fair," she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn't
crying yet, not yet, "<i>I</i> shouldn't have to fight your dark
side, I'm just - I'm only -" <i>I'm only twelve,</i> that was what
she thought then.</p>
<p>"I only used my dark side <i>once</i> and that was - when I
<i>had</i> to!"</p>
<p>"So today you beat my <i>whole army</i> being just Harry?" She
still wasn't crying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like
right now, if she looked like an angry Hermione or a sad one.</p>
<p>"I -" Harry said. His voice got a little lower, "I wasn't...
really <i>expecting</i> to win, that time, I know I said I was
invincible but that was just to try to scare you, I really just
thought we'd slow you down for a bit -"</p>
<p>She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she
passed Harry's face tightened up like <i>he</i> was going to
cry.</p>
<p>"Is Professor Quirrell right?" came a high desperate whisper
from behind her. "If I have you for a friend, will I always be
afraid to do better because I know it will hurt your feelings?
That's not fair, Hermione!"</p>
<p>She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across
the stone as fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with
her vision all blurry, ran so that no one would hear her, and this
time Harry didn't follow.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva was going over the Transfiguration parchment due Monday,
and had just marked down to negative two hundred points a
fifth-year parchment with an error that could have potentially
killed someone. During her first year as a professor she'd been
indignant at the folly of older students, now she was just
resigned. Some people not only never learned, they never noticed
that they were hopeless, they stayed bright and eager and kept on
trying. Sometimes they believed you when you told them, before they
left Hogwarts, that they must <i>never</i> try anything unusual,
give up free Transfiguration and use the art only through
established Charms; and sometimes... they didn't.</p>
<p>She was in the middle of trying to unravel a particularly
convoluted answer when a knock at the door disrupted her thoughts;
and it wasn't her office hours, but it had only taken a very short
time as Head of Gryffindor House for her to learn to suspend
judgment. You could always deduct House points
<i>afterward.</i></p>
<p>"Come in," she said in a crisp voice.</p>
<p>The young girl who entered her office had clearly been crying,
and then afterward had washed her face in hopes it wouldn't show
-</p>
<p>"Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall. It had taken her a
moment to recognize that face with its eyes reddened and cheeks
puffed. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"Professor," said the young girl in a wavering voice, "you said
that if I was ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, I
should come to you at once -"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall, "now what
<i>happened?</i>"</p>
<p>The girl started to explain -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a
revolving helix that shouldn't have taken her anywhere at all, and
instead bore her continuously <i>upward.</i> Hermione thought it
seemed like the Enchantment of the Endless Stair, which had been
invented in 1733 by the wizard Arram Sabeti who'd lived on top of
Mount Everest in the days when no Muggles could climb it. Only that
couldn't be right because Hogwarts was much older - maybe the
enchantment had been <i>re</i>invented?</p>
<p>She should've been frightened, should've been nervous about her
second meeting with the Headmaster.</p>
<p>She <i>was</i>, in fact, frightened and nervous about her second
meeting with the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she'd been thinking a
lot, after she hadn't been able to run any further and had slid
down against the wall with her lungs on fire, thinking while she
curled up in a ball with her back against the chilly stone wall and
her legs drawn up and crying.</p>
<p>Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to
lose to Draco Malfoy, that was just totally <i>absolutely</i>
unacceptable, and Professor Quirrell had praised General Malfoy for
not ignoring his thousand alternatives; and so after Hermione had
cried herself out she'd thought of fourteen other spells she
<i>should've</i> tried against Harry and Neville, and then she'd
started wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistake
about other things; and that was how she'd ended up knocking on
Professor McGonagall's door. Not asking for help, right now
Hermione didn't have any plans she could ask for help <i>with,</i>
just telling Professor McGonagall everything, because when she'd
thought of it that had seemed like one of the thousand alternatives
that Professor Quirrell had been talking about.</p>
<p>And she'd told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter had
changed since the day the phoenix had been on his shoulder, and
about how people more and more seemed to see her as just something
of Harry's, and how it seemed like Harry was pulling farther and
farther away from everyone else in their school year and went
around with a sad air sometimes like he was losing something, and
<i>she didn't know what to do anymore.</i></p>
<p>And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk
to the Headmaster.</p>
<p>And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come to
her that <i>Harry Potter</i> wouldn't have been scared of the
Headmaster. Harry Potter would have just barged ahead doing
whatever he was trying to do. Maybe (the thought had come to her)
it was worth <i>trying</i> to be like that, <i>not</i> being
scared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her, it
couldn't really be worse.</p>
<p>The Endless Stair stopped turning.</p>
<p>The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin
knocker opened without being touched.</p>
<p>Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in every
direction, looking like it had drawers set <i>inside</i> other
drawers, was the silver-bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his
throne, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, into whose gently
twinkling eyes Hermione looked for around three seconds before she
was distracted by all the other things in the room.</p>
<p>Some time later - she wasn't sure how long but it was while she
was trying to count the number of things in the room for the third
time and <i>still</i> not getting the same answer, even though her
memory insisted that nothing had been added or removed - the
Headmaster cleared his throat and said, "Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>Hermione's head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in
her cheeks; but Dumbledore didn't appear annoyed with her at all,
only serene, and with an inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed
eyes.</p>
<p>"Hermione," said Professor McGonagall, the older witch's voice
was gentle and her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione's shoulder,
"please tell the Headmaster what you said to me about Harry."</p>
<p>Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution her
voice still stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described
how Harry had changed in the last few weeks since Fawkes had been
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmaster
sighed. "I am sorry, Hermione Granger," said Dumbledore. Those blue
eyes had grown sadder as she spoke. "That is... unfortunate, but I
cannot say it is unexpected. That is a hero's burden, which you
see."</p>
<p>"A <i>hero?</i>" said Hermione. She looked up nervously at
Professor McGonagall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor's
face had grown tight, though her hand still squeezed Hermione's
shoulder reassuringly.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore. "I was a hero myself once, before I was
a mysterious old wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald.
You have read history books, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dumbledore, "that is what heroes have to do, Miss
Granger, they have their tasks and they must grow strong to
accomplish them, and that is what you see happening to Harry. If
there is anything that can be done to gentle his pathway, then
<i>you</i> will be the one to do it, and not I. For I am not
Harry's friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard."</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "I'm not sure - I still want to be -" Her
voice stopped, it seemed too awful to say aloud.</p>
<p>Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked a
little older than before. "No one can stop you, Miss Granger, if
you choose to stop being Harry's friend. As for what it would do to
him, you may know that better than I."</p>
<p>"That - doesn't seem <i>fair,</i>" Hermione said, her voice
trembling. "That I've <i>got</i> to be Harry's friend because he's
got no one else? That doesn't seem fair."</p>
<p>"<i>Being</i> a friend is not something you can be forced to,
Miss Granger." The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. "The
feelings are there, or they are not. If they are there, you can
accept them or deny them. You <i>are</i> Harry's friend - and
choosing to deny it would wound him terribly, perhaps beyond
healing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to such
extremes?"</p>
<p>She couldn't find words. She'd never been able to find words.
"If you get too near Harry - you get <i>swallowed up,</i> and no
one sees <i>you</i> any more, you're just something of <i>his,</i>
everyone thinks the whole world revolves around him and..." She
didn't have the words.</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded slowly. "It is indeed an unjust world we
live in, Miss Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who
defeated Grindelwald, and fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died
opening the way so I could pass through. And yet she is remembered.
Harry Potter <i>is</i> the hero of this play, Miss Granger; the
world <i>does</i> revolve around him. He is destined for great
things; and I ween that in time the name of Albus Dumbledore will
be remembered as Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard, more than
for anything else I have done. And perhaps the name of Hermione
Granger will be remembered as his companion, if you prove worthy of
it in your day. For this I tell you true: never will you find more
glory on your own, than in Harry Potter's company."</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head rapidly. "But that's <i>not</i> -" She'd
known she wouldn't be able to explain. "It's not about
<i>glory,</i> it's about being - something that belongs to someone
else!"</p>
<p>"So you think you would rather be the hero?" The old wizard
sighed. "Miss Granger, I have <i>been</i> a hero, and a leader; and
I would have been a thousand times happier if I could have belonged
to someone like Harry Potter. Someone made of sterner stuff than I,
to make the hard decisions, and yet worthy to lead me. I thought,
once, that I knew such a man, but I was mistaken... Miss Granger,
you have no idea at <i>all</i> how fortunate are those like you,
compared to heroes."</p>
<p>The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, along
with helplessness, she didn't understand why Professor McGonagall
had brought her here if the Headmaster wasn't going to help, and
from a glance at Professor McGonagall's face, it looked like
Professor McGonagall also wasn't sure now that it had been a good
idea.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a hero," said Hermione Granger, "I don't
want to be a hero's companion, I just want to be <i>me.</i>"</p>
<p>(The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she
<i>did</i> in fact want to be a hero, but she decided not to change
what she'd said.)</p>
<p>"Ah," said the old wizard. "That is a tall order, Miss Granger."
Dumbledore rose from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and
pointed to a symbol on the wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione's eyes
had glossed right over it; a faded shield on which was inscribed
the heraldry of Hogwarts, the lion and snake, and badger and raven,
and in Latin engraved words whose point she'd never understood.
Then, as she realized where that shield was, and how old it looked,
it suddenly occurred to Hermione that this might be the
<i>original</i> -</p>
<p>"A Hufflepuff would say," said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on
the faded badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it
<i>was</i> the original), "that people fail to become who they are
meant to be, because they are too lazy to put in all the work
involved. A Ravenclaw," tapping the raven, "would repeat those
words that the wise know to be far older than Socrates, <i>know
thyself,</i> and say that people fail to become who they are meant
to be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And Salazar
Slytherin," Dumbledore frowned as his finger tapped the faded
snake, "why, he said that we become who we are meant to be by
following our desires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would say that
people fail to become themselves because they refuse to do what is
necessary to achieve their ambitions. But then one notes that
nearly all of the Dark Wizards to come out of Hogwarts have been
Slytherins. Did they become what they were meant to be? I think
not." Dumbledore's finger tapped the lion, and then he turned
toward her. "Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say? I
do not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you that
House."</p>
<p>It didn't seem like a hard question. "A Gryffindor would say
that people don't become who they should be, because they're
afraid."</p>
<p>"Most people <i>are</i> afraid, Miss Granger," said the old
wizard. "They live their whole lives circumscribed by crippling
fear that cuts off everything they might accomplish, everything
they might become. Fear of saying or doing the wrong thing, fear of
losing their mere possessions, fear of death, and above all the
fear of what other people will think of them. Such fear is a most
terrible thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important to know
that. But it is not what Godric Gryffindor would have said. People
become who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is
right." The old wizard's voice was gentle. "So tell me, Miss
Granger, what seems to you like the <i>right</i> choice? For
<i>that</i> is who you truly are, and wherever that path leads,
that is who you are meant to become."</p>
<p>There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that
could not be counted.</p>
<p>She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>"I don't <i>think</i> it's right," Hermione said slowly, "for
someone to have to live inside someone else's shadow like
that..."</p>
<p>"Many things in the world are not right," said the old wizard,
"the question is what is right for <i>you</i> to do about them.
Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a
mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot
<i>imagine</i> how badly things could go if the events surrounding
Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you would not even
<i>dream</i> of walking away from, if you knew."</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> quest?" said Hermione. Her voice was trembling,
because it was very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking
for and she didn't want to give it. "What <i>happened</i> to Harry
back then, <i>why</i> was Fawkes on his shoulder?"</p>
<p>"He grew up," said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several
times, beneath the half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked
very lined. "You see, Miss Granger, people do not grow up because
of time, people grow up when they are placed in grownup situations.
That is what happened to Harry Potter that Saturday. He was told -
you are not to share this information with anyone, you understand -
he was told that he would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you
who. I cannot tell you why. But that is what happened to him, and
why he needs his friends."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"<i>Bellatrix Black?</i>" Hermione said. She couldn't have been
more shocked if someone had plugged an electrical cord into her
ear. "You're going to make Harry fight <i>Bellatrix
Black?</i>"</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard. "Not her. I cannot tell you who, or
why."</p>
<p>She thought about it some more.</p>
<p>"Is there any way I can <i>keep up</i> with Harry?" said
Hermione. "I mean, I'm not saying it's what I'll <i>do</i>, but -
if he needs friends then can we be <i>equal</i> friends? Can I be a
hero too?"</p>
<p>"Ah," said the old wizard, and smiled. "Only you can decide
that, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>"But you're not going to help me like you're helping Harry."</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head. "I have helped him little enough,
Miss Granger. And if you are asking me for a quest -" The old
wizard smiled again, rather wryly. "Miss Granger, you are in your
first year of Hogwarts. Do not be too eager to grow up; there will
be time enough for that later."</p>
<p>"I'm twelve. Harry's <i>eleven.</i>"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is special," said the old wizard. "As you know,
Miss Granger." The blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the
half-moon glasses, and she was reminded of the day of the Dementor
when Dumbledore's voice had said, inside her mind, that he knew
about Harry's dark side.</p>
<p>Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall's
hand, which had stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and
Hermione said, she was surprised that her voice didn't break, "I'd
like to go, now, please."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the
hand on her shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken
door.</p>
<p>"Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?" said Albus
Dumbledore's voice from behind her, even as the door slowly creaked
open to reveal the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I'll," she said, her voice stuck, "I'll, I'll -"</p>
<p>She swallowed.</p>
<p>"I'll do - what's right -"</p>
<p>She didn't say anything else, she couldn't, and then the Endless
Stair began revolving around her once again.</p>
<p>Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down.</p>
<p>When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and
the two of them stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts,
Professor McGonagall finally spoke, and she said in a whisper, "I'm
so terribly sorry, Miss Granger. I did not think the Headmaster
would say such things to you. I think he truly has forgotten what
it is like to be a child."</p>
<p>Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor
McGonagall looked like <i>she</i> was about to burst into tears...
only not really, but there was a tightness in her face that was
like that.</p>
<p>"If I want to be a hero too," said Hermione, "if I've decided to
be a hero too, is there anything <i>you</i> can do to help?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, "Miss
Granger, I'm not sure the Headmaster is wrong about <i>that.</i>
You <i>are</i> twelve."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione.</p>
<p>They walked forward a bit.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Hermione, "is it okay if I walk back to the
Ravenclaw tower by myself? I'm sorry, it's not your fault or
anything, I just want to be by myself right now."</p>
<p>"Of course, Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, her voice
sounding a little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop,
and then turn around behind her.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger walked away.</p>
<p>She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if
there was anyone else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be
a hero. Professor Flitwick would say the same thing as Professor
McGonagall, and even if he didn't, he probably couldn't help,
Hermione didn't know who <i>could</i> help. Well, Professor
Quirrell would come up with something clever if she used up enough
Quirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a
bad idea - that the Defense Professor couldn't help anyone become
the sort of hero that was worth becoming, and that he wouldn't even
understand the difference.</p>
<p>She had almost gotten to the Ravenclaw tower when she saw the
flash of gold.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="69">Chapter 69</h2><h3>Self Actualization, Pt
4</h3>
<p>It was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw
it, a reflection on the polished metal of a statue at the junction
of two corridors, a flash of gold, a flash of red, something like
an image of fire; just for a moment she saw it, and then it was
gone.</p>
<p>She paused, puzzled, and she <i>almost</i> walked away, but
there had been something familiar about that brief glow -</p>
<p>Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked at
the corridor from which she thought the fiery reflection might have
come.</p>
<p>Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the
call.</p>
<p>Hermione started to run.</p>
<p>She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would
pause, catch as much breath as she could, and then she would see a
flash of fire reflected from one direction or another, or hear that
distant call. If it hadn't been for her army training she would've
fallen over in exhaustion, running like that.</p>
<p>She never saw the phoenix.</p>
<p>And then she came to a four-way branch and there was
<i>nothing,</i> no sign, she waited for long seconds and she heard
no cry and saw no fire, and she was only just starting to wonder
with a sick sad feeling if she'd imagined the whole thing, when she
heard a <i>person</i> cry out.</p>
<p>When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in
the whole scene at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes
already turning to look at her, and one shorter and smaller boy in
yellow, who was dangling in the air from one foot held up high by
an invisible hand.</p>
<p>The Sunshine General didn't even think about it, people who
stopped to think didn't spring very good ambushes.</p>
<p>Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips
said "<i>Somnium!</i>" and the largest bully fell over, the
Hufflepuff boy dropped out of the air with a <i>thump</i> and the
other two bullies were trying to aim their wands at her and she
said "<i>Somnium!</i>" again and another huge boy keeled over -
the one who'd been aiming his wand faster, that was who she'd fired
at.</p>
<p>Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was
hard even for her, and she couldn't get off a third before -</p>
<p>The last bully shouted "<i>Protego!</i>" and was surrounded by
a shimmering blue glow.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a
<i>real</i> Shielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells on
her even while he was protected.</p>
<p><i>Now</i> she -</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>" shouted the bully-boy.</p>
<p>The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance,
blazing far brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry's
wand.</p>
<p>Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed,
because the bully's <i>aim</i> hadn't been nearly as good as
Harry's; and the thought came to her that maybe bullies and
Professor Quirrell's armies didn't mix.</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>" shouted the bully-boy again.
"<i>Expelliarmus! Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>Anyway, <i>now</i> she'd just spent a whole hour thinking of all
the <i>other</i> spells she could've cast on Harry and Neville
-</p>
<p>"<i>Jellyfy!</i>" yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with
no visible bolt to dodge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too
weak to support her. And then, with an angry roar producing an even
brighter blaze of crimson, "<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she'd
recovered enough for her next spell, which was -</p>
<p>"<i>Glisseo,</i>" said Hermione, directing her remark to the
floor.</p>
<p>"Oof," said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him
and <i>he actually dropped his wand.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Protego</i> winked out.</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium,</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where
the Hufflepuff boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his
skull where he'd been dropped head-first into the floor; it was a
good thing he hadn't been a Muggle, Hermione realized, or he might
have snapped his neck. She hadn't actually thought of that.</p>
<p>"Uh," said the boy, his hair was of a color that would've been
called 'brunette' if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished
brown that somehow seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren't
any tears on his face but he looked sort of pale. She pegged him at
about fourth year, or third.</p>
<p>Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. "<i>General
Sunshine?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said. "That's <i>(gasp)</i> me." If the Hufflepuff
boy said anything about her being Harry Potter's love interest, she
decided, he was going to die.</p>
<p>"Wow," said the Hufflepuff boy. "That was - you just - I mean I
saw you on the screens before Christmas but - wow! I can't believe
you just did that!"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p><i>I can't believe I just did that,</i> thought Hermione
Granger, who was feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must
have been all that running. "Excuse <i>(gasp)</i> me," she said,
"can you <i>(gasp)</i> Unjellyfy my legs?"</p>
<p>The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside
his robes for his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture
before the counter-Jinx worked right.</p>
<p>"I'm Michael Hopkins," said the boy once Hermione had rolled
back to her own feet. He stuck out his hand. "Or just Mike inside
Hufflepuff, there aren't any other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this
year, would you believe it?"</p>
<p>They shook hands, and Mike said, "Anyway, <i>thank you.</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her
then, saving someone like that literally felt better than anything
she'd ever felt in her <i>whole life.</i></p>
<p>She turned to look at the bullies.</p>
<p>They were very big and they looked, she thought, around fifteen
years old, and she was suddenly realizing just how <i>large</i> a
difference had sprung up between Hogwarts students who'd signed up
for all of Professor Quirrell's extra-curricular activities, and
students who'd had years of being taught by the worst Professors
ever to go Professing. Being able to <i>hit</i> things that you
aimed at, for example; or being able to think well enough in the
middle of a fight to realize that you ought to <i>Innervate</i>
your fallen allies. And other things Professor Quirrell had said,
like that in the real world almost any fight would be settled by a
surprise attack, suddenly made a lot more sense to her.</p>
<p>Still trying to catch her breath, she looked back at Mike.</p>
<p>"Would you <i>(gasp)</i> believe," said Hermione Granger, "that
five minutes ago I was <i>(gasp)</i> having trouble figuring out
how to become a <i>(gasp)</i> hero?"</p>
<p>Had she really thought she needed <i>permission</i> from
someone, or that heroes sat around waiting for someone else to give
them quests? It was very simple actually, you just went where the
evil was, that was all it ever took to be a hero. She should've
remembered, she shouldn't have needed a phoenix to tell her, that
bad things sometimes happened right here in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Then Hermione glanced nervously back at where the three older
boys were lying unconscious as the realization hit that they'd
<i>seen</i> her, they might <i>know</i> who she was, they might
sneak up on her and take <i>her</i> by surprise and - and they
could really hurt her -</p>
<p>Hermione stopped.</p>
<p>She remembered that Harry Potter had put himself in the middle
of <i>five</i> Slytherin bullies on the first day of class when he
hadn't even known how to use his wand.</p>
<p>She remembered the Headmaster saying that you grew up by being
put in grownup situations, and that most people lived their lives
inside a constraining circle of fear.</p>
<p>And she remembered Professor McGonagall's voice saying, 'You
<i>are</i> twelve.'</p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath, once, twice, and three times.</p>
<p>She asked Mike if he needed to go to Madam Pomfrey's office,
which he didn't; and got him to tell her the names of the Slytherin
boys, just in case.</p>
<p>And then Hermione Granger strolled away from the heap of
unconscious bullies, making sure to put a smile on her face as she
walked.</p>
<p>She knew that she was probably going to get hurt sooner or
later. But if you were too scared of getting hurt to do what was
right, then you couldn't be a hero, it was as simple as that; and
if you'd put the Sorting Hat on her head at that moment it wouldn't
have waited even <i>one</i> <i>second</i> before calling out
'GRYFFINDOR!'</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>She was still thinking about it when she came down to dinner;
the euphoria of saving someone still hadn't worn off, and she was
beginning to worry that it had broken something in her brain.</p>
<p>As she approached the Ravenclaw table a sudden epidemic of
whispers broke out, and Hermione wondered if the Hufflepuff boy had
said anything yet before she realized that the whispers probably
weren't about <i>that.</i></p>
<p>She sat down across from Harry Potter who looked
<i>extremely</i> nervous, probably because she was still
smiling.</p>
<p>"Uh -" said Harry, as she served herself freshly toasted bread,
butter, cinnamon, no fruits or vegetables whatsoever, and three
helpings of chocolate brownies. "Uh -"</p>
<p>She let him go on like that until she'd finished pouring herself
a glass of grapefruit juice, and then she said, "I've got a
question for you, Mr. Potter. How do you think people fail to
become themselves?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>She looked at him. "Pretend there isn't all this stuff going
on," she said, "and just say whatever you'd have said
yesterday."</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said, looking very confused and worried. "I think
we already <i>are</i> ourselves... it's not like I'm an imperfect
copy of someone else. But I guess if I try to run with the sense of
the question, then I'd say that people don't become themselves
because we absorb all this crazy stuff from the environment and
then regurgitate it. I mean, how many people playing Quidditch
would be playing a game like that if they'd invented the game
themselves? Or back in Muggle Britain, how many people who think of
themselves as Labour or Conservative or Liberal Democrat would
invent that exact bundle of political beliefs if they had to come
up with everything themselves?"</p>
<p>Hermione considered this. She'd been wondering if Harry would
say something Slytherin or maybe even Gryffindor, but this didn't
seem to fit into the Headmaster's list; and it occurred to Hermione
that there might be a lot more viewpoints on the subject than just
four.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione, "different question. What makes someone a
hero?"</p>
<p>"A <i>hero?</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. His fork and knife nervously sawed at a
piece of steak, cutting it into tinier and tinier pieces. "I think
a lot of people can do things when the world channels them into
it... like people are expecting you to do it, or it only uses
skills you already know, or there's an authority watching to catch
your mistakes and make sure you do your part. But problems like
that are probably already being solved, you know, and then there's
no need for heroes. So I think the people we call 'heroes' are rare
because they've got to make everything up as they go along, and
most people aren't comfortable with that. Why do you ask?" Harry's
fork stabbed three pieces of thoroughly shredded steak and lifted
them up to his mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh, I just stunned three older Slytherin bullies and rescued a
Hufflepuff," said Hermione. "I'm going to be a hero."</p>
<p>When Harry had finished choking on his food (some of the other
Ravenclaws in hearing distance were still coughing) he said,
"<i>What?</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione told the story, it began rippling out in further
whispers even as she spoke. (Though she left out the part about the
phoenix, because that seemed like a private thing between the two
of them. Hermione had felt surprised, thinking about it afterward,
that a phoenix would appear for someone who <i>wanted</i> to be a
hero; it seemed a bit selfish when she thought about it that way;
but maybe it didn't matter to phoenixes so long as they saw that
you were willing to help people.)</p>
<p>When she was done talking, Harry stared at her across the table
and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for how I acted earlier," Hermione said. She sipped
from her glass of grapefruit juice. "I should've remembered that if
I'm still beating the pants off you in Charms class then it's okay
for you to do better in Defense."</p>
<p>"<i>Please</i> don't take this the wrong way," said Harry. He
looked too-adult now, and grim. "But are you sure this is who
<i>you</i> are, and not, to put it bluntly, me?"</p>
<p>"I'm quite certain," said Hermione. "Why, my name practically
spells out 'heroine' except for the extra 'm', I never noticed that
until today."</p>
<p>"Being a hero isn't all fun and games," said Harry. "Not real
heroing, the sort grownups have to do, it isn't like this, it isn't
going to be this easy."</p>
<p>"I know," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"It's hard and it's painful and you've got to make decisions
where there isn't any good answer -"</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry, I read those books too."</p>
<p>"No," said Harry, "you don't understand, even if the books warn
you there's no way you <i>can</i> understand until -"</p>
<p>"That doesn't stop you," said Hermione. "It doesn't stop you
even a little. I bet you never even <i>considered</i> not being a
hero because of that. So why d'you think it'll stop me?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>A sudden huge smile lit Harry's face, a smile that was as bright
and as boyish as the frown had been grim and adult, and everything
was all right again between them.</p>
<p>"This is going to go horribly mind-bogglingly wrong somehow,"
said Harry, still smiling hugely. "You know that, right?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," said Hermione. She ate another bite of toast.
"That reminds me, Dumbledore refused to be my mysterious old
wizard, is there someplace I can write to get another one?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>"...and Professor Flitwick says her determination seems
unshakeable," Minerva said tightly, staring at the silver-bearded
old wizard who was responsible for this. Albus Dumbledore was just
sitting silently and listening to her with a distant sad look in
his eyes. "Miss Granger didn't even blink when Professor Flitwick
threatened to have her transferred to Gryffindor, just said that if
she left she would take all the books with her. Hermione Granger
has decided she's going to be a hero and she's not taking no for an
answer. I doubt you could have pushed her into this any harder if
you had <i>tried</i> to -"</p>
<p>It took all of five full seconds for Minerva's brain to process
the realization.</p>
<p><i>"ALBUS!"</i> she shrieked.</p>
<p>"My dear," said the old wizard, "after you have dealt with your
thirtieth hero or so, you will realize that they react quite
predictably to certain things; such as being told that they are too
young, or that they are not destined to be heroes, or that being a
hero is unpleasant; and if you truly wish to be sure you should
tell them all three. Although," with a brief sigh, "it does not do
to be <i>too</i> blatant, or your Deputy Headmistress might catch
you."</p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said, her voice even tighter, "if she is hurt,
I swear this time I'll -"</p>
<p>"She would have come to that same place in due time," Albus
said, the distant sad look still in his eyes. "If someone is meant
to become a hero then they will not listen to our warnings,
Minerva, no matter how hard we try. And given that, it is better
for Harry if Miss Granger does not fall too far behind him." Albus
produced, as though from nowhere, a tin which flipped open to
reveal small yellow lumps, she'd never been able to figure out
where he kept it and she'd never been able to detect the magic
involved. "Lemon drop?"</p>
<p>"<i>She is a twelve-year-old girl, Albus!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Afteraftermath:</i></p>
<p>Within the windows, barely visible in the evening gloom, fishes
swam in the black waters; illuminated by the bright shine of the
Slytherin common room as they came closer, fading into darkness as
they swam away.</p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass was sitting in a comfortable black leather
couch, her head collapsed into her hands, glowing golden-yellowish
as bright sparks of white light winked in and out of existence
around her.</p>
<p>She'd been ready to be teased about liking Neville Longbottom.
She'd been expecting to hear a lot of snide remarks about
Hufflepuffs. She'd thought of whole <i>reams</i> of snappy
comebacks for it while she was on the way back to the Slytherin
dungeons.</p>
<p>She'd been looking <i>forward</i> to being teased about liking
Neville. Being teased about that sort of thing meant you'd grown up
into a real girl.</p>
<p>As it turned out, nobody had worked out that her challenging
Neville to a Most Ancient Duel meant that she liked him. She'd
thought it would be <i>obvious</i> but no, nobody else had even
thought of that apparently.</p>
<p>It was always the hex you didn't see that hit you.</p>
<p>She should've just called herself Daphne of Sunshine, like
Neville of Chaos. Or Sunny Daphne like Sunny Ron. Or
<i>anything</i> except Greengrass of Sunshine.</p>
<p>Greengrass of Sunshine.</p>
<p>It had gone from there to Greengrass of Sunshine and Blue
Skies.</p>
<p>Then someone had added Snow-Topped Mountains and Frolicking
Woodland Creatures.</p>
<p>Currently she was being referred to as the Sparkly Unicorn
Princess of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Sparklypoo.</p>
<p>And some cursed sixth-year girl had hit her with a Sparkling
Jinx, she hadn't even known there <i>was</i> such a thing as a
Sparkling Jinx, and <i>Finite Incantatem</i> hadn't worked, and
she'd asked older girls who she'd <i>thought</i> were her friends
(she had apparently been wrong about this) and then she'd
threatened the caster with grievous political mayhem wreaked by her
father and nonetheless Daphne Greengrass was still sitting in the
Slytherin common room with her head in her hands, sparkling
brightly and wondering how she'd ended up as the only sane person
in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It was <i>after dinnertime</i> and they were <i>still at it</i>
and if they didn't stop by tomorrow morning she was going to
transfer to Durmstrang and become the next Dark Lady.</p>
<p>"Hey, everyone!" said the Carrow twins dramatically, waving an
issue of the <i>Daily Prophet.</i> "Did you hear the news? The
Wizengamot just ruled that 'let's see what you got' constitutes a
lawful challenge to be fought until the challenger lies down and
has a nap!"</p>
<p>"How dare you insult the honor of the Sparkly Unicorn Princess!"
shouted Tracey. "Let's see what you got!" Then Tracey lay down flat
on her sofa and started snoring loudly.</p>
<p>Daphne's sparkling head sank further into her glowing hands.
"After my family takes over I'm going to have you all put under
anti-Apparition jinxes and Flooed into the sea," she said to no one
in particular. "You're all okay with that, right?"</p>
<p><i>Thunk-thunk, thunk-thunk-thunk, thunk.</i></p>
<p>Daphne looked up, surprised; that was a Sunshine code-signal
-</p>
<p>"<i>I hight someone knocking!</i>" bellowed Mr. Goyle.
"<i>Knocking of the door!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Let's see what you've got, door!</i>" shouted an older boy
near the door, and yanked the door open.</p>
<p>There was a moment of complete surprise.</p>
<p>"I've come to have a word with Miss Greengrass," said the
Sunshine General, sounding like she was trying to sound confident.
"Could someone please -"</p>
<p>From the look on Hermione's face she had just noticed Daphne
sparkling.</p>
<p>And <i>that</i> was when Millicent Bulstrode raced up from the
lower dorms and shouted, "Hey, everyone, guess what, now
<i>Granger</i> went and beat up Derrick and what's left of his
crew, and his father owled him and said that if he didn't -"</p>
<p>Millicent caught sight of Hermione standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>There was a very loud silence.</p>
<p>"Uh," said Daphne. <i>What?</i> said her brain. "Uh, what're you
doing here, General?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Hermione Granger with a strange smile on her face,
"I've decided it's not fair if mysterious old wizards give some
people a chance to be heroes and not others, and also I've read
history books and there aren't nearly enough girl heroes in them.
So I thought I'd just drop by and see if you wanted to be a hero
and why are you glowing like that?"</p>
<p>There was another silence.</p>
<p>"This," said Daphne, "was probably <i>not</i> the best time to
ask me that question -"</p>
<p>"<i>I'll take it!</i>" shouted Tracey Davis, leaping off her
sofa.</p>

<p>Even if you had been the Deputy Headmistress for three decades,
and a Transfiguration Professor before that, it was rare that you
saw Albus Dumbledore caught completely flatfooted.</p>
<p>"...Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and Daphne Greengrass," Minerva
finished. "I should also note, Albus, that Miss Granger's account
of your seemingly unsupportive attitude - I believe her phrase was
'he said I should be happy to be just a sidekick' - has generated a
good deal of <i>interest</i> among the older girls. Several of whom
came to me to ask if Miss Granger's accusations were true, since
Miss Granger had said that I was there."</p>
<p>The old wizard leaned back in his huge chair, still gazing at
her, his eyes looking rather abstracted beneath the half-moon
glasses.</p>
<p>"It placed me in something of a dilemma, Albus," said Professor
McGonagall. Her face stayed quite neutral, she made sure of that.
"I now know that you did not truly mean to discourage the girl.
Quite the opposite, in fact. But you and Severus have often told me
that to keep a secret I must give no sign that differs from the
reaction of someone truly ignorant. Thus I had no choice but to
confirm that Miss Granger's account was accurate, and feign the
appropriate degree of worry, with a slight overtone of offense.
After all, had I <i>not</i> known you were deliberately
manipulating Miss Granger, I might have been rather put out."</p>
<p>"I... see," the old wizard said slowly. His hands toyed absently
with his silver beard, small quick gestures.</p>
<p>"Thankfully," Professor McGonagall continued, "so far Professors
Sinistra and Vector are the only two faculty members to don Miss
Granger's buttons."</p>
<p>"Buttons?" repeated the old wizard.</p>
<p>Minerva drew forth a small silver disc bearing the initials
S.P.H.E.W., laid it on Albus's desk, and gave it a brief tap with
her finger.</p>
<p>And the voices of Hermione Granger, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil,
Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Daphne Greengrass, and
Tracey Davis cried out in unison, "<i>We won't settle for second
best, it's time to give a witch a quest!</i>"</p>
<p>"Miss Granger is selling them for two Sickles, and tells me that
she has so far sold fifty of them. I believe that Nymphadora Tonks,
in seventh-year Hufflepuff, is enchanting them for her. To conclude
my report," Professor McGonagall said briskly, "our eight newly
minted heroines have asked permission to conduct a protest outside
the entrance to your office."</p>
<p>"I hope," Albus said, frowning, "you explained to them that
-"</p>
<p>"I explained to them that Wednesday at 7PM would be fine," said
Minerva. She took back the button from the Headmaster's desk,
favored Albus with a honeyed smile, and turned to the door.</p>
<p>"Minerva?" said the old wizard from behind her.
"<i>Minerva!</i>"</p>
<p>The oaken door shut solidly behind her.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>There wasn't a lot of room between the brief stone walls that
demarcated the vestibule to the Headmaster's office, so although a
lot of people had wanted to watch the protest, not many had been
allowed to come. Just Professor Sinistra and Professor Vector, who
were wearing the buttons, and the prefects Penelope Clearwater and
Rose Brown and Jacqueline Preece, who were wearing the buttons.
Behind <i>them,</i> Professor McGonagall and Professor Sprout and
Professor Flitwick, who weren't wearing the buttons, scrutinizing
the whole affair. Harry Potter and the Head Boy of Hogwarts were
there, and the boy prefects Percy Weasley and Oliver Beatson, all
wearing the buttons to show Solidarity. And of course the eight
founding members of S.P.H.E.W., forming a picket line next to the
gargoyles with their signs. Hermione's own sign, attached to a
solid wooden handle which seemed to weigh heavier and heavier in
her hands as the seconds passed, said NOBODY'S SIDEKICK.</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell, who was leaning with his back against
the far stone wall and watching with unreadable eyes. The Defense
Professor had gotten one of her buttons, though she'd never sold
one to him; and he wasn't wearing it, but idly tossing it with one
hand.</p>
<p>This whole idea had seemed like a much better idea four days
ago, when the fires of her indignation had been burning fresh and
hot, and she'd been facing the prospect of doing it all four days
<i>later</i> instead of <i>right now.</i></p>
<p>But she had to carry on, because that was what heroes did, they
carried on, and also because it had seemed infinitely too awful to
tell everyone she was calling it off. Hermione wondered how much
heroism had gone on for reasons like that. Most books didn't
<i>say</i> "And then they refused to give up, no matter how
sensible it would have been, because that would've been too
embarrassing"; but a great deal of history made a lot more sense
that way.</p>
<p>At 7:15pm, Professor McGonagall had told her, Headmaster
Dumbledore would come down and talk to them for a couple of
minutes. Professor McGonagall had said not to be frightened - the
Headmaster was a good person deep down, and they'd properly gotten
the school's authorization for the protest.</p>
<p>But Hermione was very very aware that even if she was doing it
with signed permission, she was still Defying Authority.</p>
<p>After she'd decided to be a hero, Hermione had done the obvious
thing, and gone to the Hogwarts library and taken out books on how
to be a hero. Then she'd returned those books back to their
shelves, because it'd been patently obvious that none of the
authors had been actual heroes themselves. Instead she'd just read
five times over, until she'd memorized every word, the thirty
inches by Godric Gryffindor that was all his autobiography and his
life's advice. (Or the English translation, anyway; she couldn't
read Latin yet.) Godric Gryffindor's autobiography had been a lot
more <i>compressed</i> than the books Hermione was used to reading,
he used <i>one sentence</i> to say things that should've taken
thirty inches just by themselves, and then there was <i>another</i>
sentence after that...</p>
<p>But it was clear from what she'd read that, while Defying
Authority wasn't the <i>point</i> of being a hero, you couldn't be
a hero if you were too scared to do it. And Hermione Granger knew
by now how others saw her, and she knew what other people thought
she couldn't do.</p>
<p>Hermione hefted her picket sign a little higher and concentrated
on breathing slowly and rhythmically instead of hyperventilating
until she fell over.</p>
<p>"<i>Really?</i>" said Miss Preece in a tone of undisguised
fascination. "They couldn't <i>vote?</i>"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Sinistra. (The Astronomy Professor's
hair was still dark, and her dark face only slightly lined;
Hermione <i>would</i> have guessed her age at around seventy,
except -) "I quite remember my mother's rejoicing when they
announced the Qualification of Women Act, although she did not
actually qualify." (Which meant that Professor Sinistra had been
around her Muggle family in 1918.) "And that wasn't the worst of
it. Why, just a few centuries earlier -"</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later all the non-Muggleborns, male and female
both, were staring at Professor Sinistra with utterly shocked
expressions. Hannah had dropped her sign.</p>
<p>"And <i>that</i> wasn't the worst of it either, not by half,"
finished Professor Sinistra. "But you see where this sort of thing
could potentially lead."</p>
<p>"Merlin preserve us," said Penelope Clearwater in a strangled
voice. "You mean <i>that's</i> how men would treat us if we didn't
have wands to defend ourselves?"</p>
<p>"<i>Hey!</i>" said one of the boy prefects. "<i>That's</i> not
-"</p>
<p>There was a short, sardonic laugh from the direction of
Professor Quirrell. When Hermione turned her head to look she saw
that the Defense Professor was still idly toying with the button,
not bothering to glance up at the rest of them, as he said, "Such
is human nature, Miss Clearwater. Rest assured that <i>you</i>
would be no kinder, if witches had wands and men lacked them."</p>
<p>"I hardly think so!" snapped Professor Sinistra.</p>
<p>A cold chuckle. "I suspect it happens more often than any dare
suggest, in the proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch
spies a handsome Muggle; and thinks how very easy it would be, to
slip the man a love potion, and by him be adored alone and utterly.
And since she knows he can offer her no resistance, why, it is only
natural for her to take from him whatever she pleases -"</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Quirrell!</i>" said Professor McGonagall
sharply.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Professor Quirrell said mildly, his eyes still
looking down on the button in his hand, "are we all still
pretending it doesn't happen? My apologies, then."</p>
<p>Professor Sinistra snapped, "And I suppose that wizards don't
-"</p>
<p>"There are <i>children</i> present, Professors!" Again Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Some do," Professor Quirrell said equably, as though discussing
the weather. "Although personally, I don't."</p>
<p>There was a bit of silence, for a time. Hermione put up her sign
again - it had slipped down to her shoulder while she was
listening. She'd never thought of that, not even a little, and now
she was trying <i>not</i> to think of it, and her stomach was
feeling a bit queasy. She looked in Harry Potter's direction, not
quite knowing why she did; and she saw that Harry's face was
perfectly still. A chill ran down her spine before she looked away,
not quite fast enough to miss the small nod that Harry gave her, as
though they were agreeing on something.</p>
<p>"To be fair," Professor Sinistra said after a while, "since I
received my Hogwarts letter I can't recall encountering any
prejudice on account of being a woman, or colored. No, now it is
all for being a Muggleborn. I believe Miss Granger said that it was
<i>just</i> with heroes that she found a problem, so far?"</p>
<p>It took Hermione a moment to recognize that she'd been asked the
question, and then she said "Yes," in a tone that squeaked a
little. This whole thing had blown up a bit larger than she'd
imagined when she'd started it.</p>
<p>"What exactly did you check, Miss Granger?" said Professor
Vector. She looked older than Professor Sinistra, her hair starting
to gray a little; Hermione hadn't ever come close to Professor
Vector in person until the Arithmancy Professor had asked her for a
button.</p>
<p>"Um," Hermione said, her voice a little high, "I checked the
history books and there's been as many woman Ministers of Magic as
men. Then I looked at Supreme Mugwumps and there were a few more
wizards than witches but not many. But if you look at people like
famous Dark Wizard hunters, or people who've stopped invasions of
Dark creatures, or people who've overthrown Dark Lords -"</p>
<p>"And the Dark Wizards themselves, of course," said Professor
Quirrell. <i>Now</i> the Defense Professor had looked up. "You may
add that to your list, Miss Granger. Among all the suspected Death
Eaters we know of only two sorceresses, Bellatrix Black and Alecto
Carrow. And I daresay that most wizards would be hard-pressed to
name a single Dark Lady besides Baba Yaga."</p>
<p>Hermione just stared at him.</p>
<p>He couldn't <i>possibly</i> be -</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Professor Vector, "what exactly are
you implying?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor raised the button so that the
golden-lettered S.P.H.E.W. faced them, and said, "Heroes," then
turned the button to show its silver backside and said, "Dark
Wizards. They are similar career paths followed by similar people,
and one can hardly ask why young witches are turning away from one
course without considering its reflection."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>now</i> I see!" said Tracey Davis, speaking up so
suddenly that Hermione gave a small startle. "You're joining our
protest because you're worried that not enough girls are becoming
Dark Witches!" Then Tracey giggled, which Hermione couldn't have
managed at this point if you paid her a million pounds
sterling.</p>
<p>There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell's face as he
replied, "Not really, Miss Davis. In truth I do not care about that
sort of thing in the slightest. But it is futile to count the
witches among Ministers of Magic and other such ordinary folk
leading ordinary existences, when Grindelwald and Dumbledore and
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were all men." The Defense Professor's
fingers idly spun the button, turning it over and over. "Then
again, only a very few folk ever do anything interesting with their
lives. What does it matter to you if <i>they</i> are mostly witches
or mostly wizards, so long as <i>you</i> are not among them? And I
suspect you will not be among them, Miss Davis; for although you
are ambitious, you have no ambition."</p>
<p>"<i>That's not true!</i>" said Tracey indignantly. "And what's
it mean?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaning
against the wall. "You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis, and
I expect that you will grasp at any opportunity for advancement
which falls into your hands. But there is no great ambition that
you are driven to accomplish, and you will not <i>make</i> your
opportunities. At best you will grasp your way upward into Minister
of Magic, or some other high position of unimportance, never
breaking the bounds of your existence."</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell's gaze shifted away from Tracey, he was
looking at <i>her,</i> the pale blue eyes staring at her with an
awful intensity <i>-</i> "Tell me, Miss Granger. Do <i>you</i> have
an ambition?"</p>
<p>"Professor -" squeaked the high stern voice of Professor
Flitwick, and then her Head of House's voice cut off, and from the
side of her vision Hermione saw that Harry had laid his hand on
Professor Flitwick's shoulder and was shaking his head, face
looking very adult.</p>
<p>Hermione felt like a deer caught in headlights.</p>
<p>"What drove you to break your bounds, Miss Granger?" said the
Defense Professor, still gazing directly at her. "Why is getting
good marks in class no longer enough? Is it true greatness that you
seek? Does some aspect of the world dissatisfy you, that you must
remake according to your will? Or is this all merely a child's game
to you? I will be quite disappointed if this is only about rivaling
Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione, her voice so high-pitched it made a sort of
peeping sound, but then she couldn't think of what else to say.</p>
<p>"You may take a moment to think, if you like," said Professor
Quirrell. "Pretend it is a homework essay, six inches due Thursday.
I hear you are quite eloquent in them."</p>
<p>Everyone was looking at her.</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "I don't agree with one single thing you
just said, anywhere."</p>
<p>"Well spoken," came Professor McGonagall's crisp voice.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze did not waver. "That is not six
inches, Miss Granger. <i>Something</i> drives you to defy the
Headmaster's verdict and gather followers about yourself. Perhaps
it is something you prefer not to speak aloud?"</p>
<p>Hermione knew the correct answer wouldn't impress Professor
Quirrell, but it was the correct answer, so she said it. "I don't
think you need ambition to be a hero," Hermione said. Her voice
wavered but it didn't crack. "I think you just have to do what's
right. And they're not my followers, we're friends."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell leaned back against the wall again. The
half-smile had faded from his face. "Most folk tell themselves they
are doing right, Miss Granger. They do not thereby rise above the
ordinary."</p>
<p>Hermione took a couple of deep breaths, trying to be brave.
"It's not <i>about</i> being not ordinary," she said as stoutly as
she could. "But I think if someone just tries to do what's right,
over and over again, and they're not too lazy to do all the work it
takes, and they think about what they're doing, and they're brave
enough to do it even when they're scared -" Hermione paused for an
instant, her eyes darting to Tracey and Daphne, "- and they
cleverly plan how to do it - and they don't just do what other
people do - then I think someone like that would already get into
enough trouble."</p>
<p>Some of the girls and boys chuckled, as did Professor
McGonagall, who looked wry and proud at the same time.</p>
<p>"You may be right about that," said the Defense Professor, his
eyes half-lidded. He tossed Hermione the button, and she caught it
without thinking. "My donation to your cause, Miss Granger. I
understand that they are worth two Sickles."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor turned and walked away without another
word.</p>
<p>"I thought I was going to faint!" gasped Hannah after his
footsteps had faded, and she heard some of the other girls letting
out their breath or putting down their signs for a moment.</p>
<p>"I do <i>too</i> have an ambition!" said Tracey, who seemed to
be almost on the verge of tears. "I'm - I'm - I'll figure out what
it is by tomorrow, but I have one, I'm sure!"</p>
<p>"If you really can't think of anything," Daphne said, giving
Tracey a comforting pat on the shoulder, "just go with the oldie
but goodie and try to take over the world."</p>
<p>"Hey!" said Susan sharply. "You're supposed to be heroes now!
That means you have to be <i>good!</i>"</p>
<p>"No, it's all right," said Lavender, "I'm pretty sure General
Chaos wants to take over the world and <i>he's</i> sort of a good
guy."</p>
<p>More conversation was going on behind the picket line. "My
goodness," said Penelope Clearwater. "I think that's the most
<i>overtly</i> evil Defense Professor we've ever had."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall coughed warningly, and the Head Boy said,
"You weren't around for Professor Barney," which made several
people twitch.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell just <i>talks</i> like that," said Harry
Potter, though he sounded less certain than before. "I mean, think
about it, he doesn't <i>do</i> anything like what Professor Snape
does -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor Flitwick, voice polite and face
stern, "why did you ask me to stay silent?"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell was testing Hermione to see if he wanted to
be her mysterious old wizard," Harry said. "Which totally would not
have worked out in any way, shape, or form, but she had to answer
for herself."</p>
<p>Hermione blinked.</p>
<p>Then Hermione blinked again, as she realized that it was
Professor Quirrell who was Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard,
and not Dumbledore at all, and that <i>really wasn't a good sign
-</i></p>
<p>A rumbling noise filled the small stone vestibule, and Hermione,
her nerves already on edge, spun rapidly around, almost dropping
her protest sign as her other hand darted toward her wand.</p>
<p>The gargoyles were stepping aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling
like rock as it moved like flesh. The huge ugly figures waited only
briefly, dead gray eyes staring out in silent vigil. Then the great
gargoyles folded their wings back into place and stepped back into
their former positions, the Flowing Stone not changing its outward
appearance at all as it returned from flexibility to
motionlessness, and the brief gap in the stone of Hogwarts was
solid once more.</p>
<p>And before them all, wearing robes of bright purple that
probably only looked hideous if you were Muggleborn, stood the
towering form of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the
Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the
Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, the
vanquisher of the Dark Lord Grindelwald and protector of Britain,
the rediscoverer of the fabled Twelve Uses of Dragon's Blood, the
most powerful wizard alive; and he was looking at <i>her,</i>
Hermione Jean Granger, General of the recently expanded Sunshine
Regiment, who was getting the best grades in the first year of
Hogwarts classes, and who had declared herself a heroine.</p>
<p>Even her <i>name</i> was shorter than his.</p>
<p>The Headmaster smiled benevolently at her, his wrinkle-lined
eyes twinkling cheerfully beneath their half-circles of glass, and
said, "Hello, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>The odd thing was that it wasn't nearly as scary as talking to
Professor Quirrell. "Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore," Hermione said
with only a slight quaver in her voice.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," said Dumbledore, now looking more serious, "I
think you and I may have had a bit of a misunderstanding. I did not
mean to imply that you could not, or should not be a hero. I
certainly did not mean to imply that witches in general should not
be heroes. Only that you were... a bit young, to be thinking of
such things."</p>
<p>Hermione, unable to help herself, glanced at Professor
McGonagall and saw that Professor McGonagall was giving her an
encouraging smile - or she was giving the two of them <i>some</i>
kind of smile, anyway - so Hermione looked back at the Headmaster
and said, the small quaver in her voice a little larger now, "Since
you became Headmaster forty years ago, there've been eleven
students to graduate Hogwarts who became heroes, I mean people like
Lupe Cazaril and so on, and <i>ten</i> of those were boys. Cimorene
Linderwall was the only witch."</p>
<p>"Hm," said the Headmaster. There was a thoughtful expression on
his face; he at least <i>seemed</i> to be thinking about it. "Miss
Granger, I have never been one for tallying such numbers. Often it
is too much easier to count than to understand. Many good people
have come out of Hogwarts, witches and wizards both; those famed as
heroes are only one kind of good person, and perhaps not the
highest. You did not include Alice Longbottom or Lily Potter in
your reckoning... But leave that aside. Tell me, Miss Granger, did
you tally how many heroes came out of Hogwarts in the forty years
before me? For in that time I can recall only three now called
heroes; and among those three, no witches at all."</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to say it's <i>just</i> you!" Hermione said.
"Only I think maybe a <i>lot</i> of people, like the Headmasters
before you too, maybe even your whole society and everything, might
be discouraging girls."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. His half-glasses eyes looked only at her,
as though they were the only two people present. "Miss Granger, it
might be possible to discourage witches from becoming Charms
Mistresses, or Quidditch players, or even Aurors. But not heroes.
If someone is meant to be a hero then a hero they will be. They
will walk through fire and swim through ice. Dementors will not
stop them, nor the deaths of friends, and not discouragement
either."</p>
<p>"Well," Hermione said, and paused, struggling with the words.
"Well, I mean... what if that's not <i>actually</i> true? I mean,
to <i>me</i> it seems that if you want more witches to be heroes,
you ought to teach them heroing."</p>
<p>"Many boys and girls are heroes in their dreams," Dumbledore
said quietly. He did not look at any of the other girls, only at
her. "Fewer in the waking world. Many have stood their ground and
faced the darkness when it comes for them. Fewer come for the
darkness and force it to face them. It is a hard life, sometimes
lonely, often short. I have told none to refuse that calling, but
neither would I wish to increase their number."</p>
<p>Hermione hesitated; there was something in the lined face that
stopped her, like a hint to all the emotion that wasn't being
displayed, years and years of it...</p>
<p><i>Maybe if there were more heroes, their lives wouldn't be so
lonely, or so short.</i></p>
<p>She couldn't bring herself to say that, though, not to him.</p>
<p>"But the point is moot," said the old wizard. He smiled, a bit
ruefully she thought. "Miss Granger, you cannot teach heroism like
you would teach Charms. You cannot assign twelve inches on how to
carry on when all hope seems lost. You cannot rehearse students on
when to stand up and tell the Headmaster he has done wrong. Heroes
are born, not taught. And for whatever reason, more of them are
born boys than girls." The Headmaster shrugged, as if to say that
<i>he</i> was helpless to do anything about that.</p>
<p>"Um," Hermione said. She couldn't help it, she glanced behind
her.</p>
<p>Professor Sinistra was looking a bit indignant. And it
<i>wasn't</i> true that everyone was staring at her like she'd just
been silly, the way she'd started to imagine while she was
listening to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Hermione turned back to face Dumbledore again, took a deep
breath, and said, "Well, maybe people who are going to be heroes,
will be heroes no matter what. But I don't see how anyone could
really <i>know</i> that, aside from just saying it afterward. And
when <i>I</i> told you that I wanted to be a hero, you weren't very
encouraging."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said mildly. His eyes didn't leave
hers. "Please tell Miss Granger your impression of our own first
meeting. Would you say that I was encouraging? Speak the
truth."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Professor Vector's voice from behind her,
sounding puzzled.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry's voice said from further back, sounding extremely
reluctant. "Um... well, actually in my case the Headmaster set fire
to a chicken."</p>
<p>"He <i>what?</i>" Hermione blurted, only there were several
other people exclaiming things at around the same time so she
wasn't sure anyone heard her.</p>
<p>Dumbledore went on gazing at her, looking perfectly serious.</p>
<p>"I didn't know about Fawkes," Harry's voice said rapidly, "so he
told me that Fawkes was a phoenix, while he was pointing to a
chicken on Fawkes's stand so I'd think <i>that</i> was Fawkes, and
then he set the chicken on fire - and also he gave me this big rock
and told me it had belonged to my father and I ought to carry it
everywhere -"</p>
<p>"But that's <i>crazy!</i>" Susan blurted out.</p>
<p>There was a sudden hush.</p>
<p>The Headmaster slowly turned his head to stare at Susan.</p>
<p>"I -" said Susan. "I mean - I -"</p>
<p>The Headmaster leaned down until he was face-to-face with the
young girl.</p>
<p>"I didn't -" said Susan.</p>
<p>Dumbledore put a finger to his lips and twiddled them, making a
<i>bweeble-bweeble-bweeble</i> sound.</p>
<p>The Headmaster straightened up again and said, "Well, my good
heroines, it has been pleasant speaking to you, but alas, much else
remains to do this day. Still, rest assured that I am inscrutable
at everyone, not just witches."</p>
<p>The gargoyles stepped aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like
rock as it moved like flesh.</p>
<p>The huge ugly figures waited briefly with dead gray eyes staring
out in silent vigil, as Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,
smiling as benevolently as when he'd first emerged from his office,
stepped back into the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.</p>
<p>Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back into place and
stepped back into their former positions, only one last brief
"Bwa-ha-ha!" echoing out before the gap closed.</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"He <i>really</i> set a chicken on fire?" said Hannah.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The eight of them had continued protesting even after that, but
to be honest their heart had gone out of it.</p>
<p>It <i>had</i> been established, after some careful questions
from Professor Flitwick, that Harry Potter hadn't smelled the
chicken burning. Which meant that it had probably been a pebble or
something, Transfigured into a chicken and then enclosed in a
Boundary Charm to make sure that no smoke escaped into the air -
both Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall had been very
emphatic about nobody trying that without their supervision.</p>
<p>But still...</p>
<p>But still... what?</p>
<p>Hermione didn't even <i>know</i> but still what.</p>
<p>But <i>still</i>.</p>
<p>After a lot of glances exchanged between girls none of whom had
wanted to be first to say it, Hermione had declared the protest
over, and the adults and boys had drifted off.</p>
<p>"You don't think we were being unfair to Dumbledore, do you?"
said Susan as the heroines walked away to the sound of eight pairs
of feet trodding on the stone paving of Hogwarts's corridors. "I
mean, if he <i>is</i> crazy at everyone and not just at witches
then it's not discrimination, right?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to protest against the Headmaster any more,"
Hannah said weakly. The Hufflepuff girl seemed a bit unsteady on
her feet. "I don't care what Professor McGonagall says about him
not holding it against us, it's just too much for my nerves."</p>
<p>Lavender snorted. "I guess <i>you</i> won't be slaying armies of
Inferi anytime soon -"</p>
<p>"Stop that!" Hermione said sharply. "Look, all of us have got to
<i>learn</i> to be heroines, right? It's okay if someone doesn't
know right away."</p>
<p>"The Headmaster doesn't think it <i>can</i> be learned," Padma
said. The Ravenclaw girl's face was thoughtful, her steps measured
as she strode through the corridor. "The Headmaster doesn't even
think that's a good idea."</p>
<p>Daphne was striding with her back straight and her head held
bolt upright, looking more like a Proper Young Lady in her Hogwarts
robes than Hermione could have done with her best formal dress.
"The Headmaster," Daphne said in a precise voice, her shoes making
hard, sharp tacking sounds on the stone, "thinks the lot of us are
a bunch of silly girls playing games, and that someday Hermione
might make a good sidekick but the rest of us are hopeless."</p>
<p>"Is he <i>right?</i>" said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl's face
was very serious, making her look much more like her twin than she
usually did. "I mean it has to be asked -"</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl was stalking
through the hallway looking ready to <i>kill</i> someone, like a
miniature female Snape. Of all the girls, Tracey was the one who
Hermione knew least. Hermione had talked to Lavender once before,
but she'd never really <i>seen</i> Tracey except at wandpoint
during a battle, until the Slytherin had jumped up from her sofa to
volunteer. "We'll show him! We'll show them <i>all!</i>"</p>
<p>"Okay," said Susan, "that was <i>definitely</i> evil -"</p>
<p>"No," said Lavender, "that's a Chaos Legion motto, actually.
Only she didn't do the insane laughter."</p>
<p>"That's right," Tracey said, her voice low and grim. "This time
I'm not laughing." The girl went on stalking through the corridor,
like she had dramatic music accompanying her that only she could
hear.</p>
<p>(Hermione was starting to worry about what <i>exactly</i> the
impressionable youths of the Chaos Legion were learning from Harry
Potter.)</p>
<p>"But - I mean -" Parvati said. She still had a contemplative
look on her face. "I mean, you can see <i>why</i> the Headmaster
would think we were just silly girls, right? What does protesting
outside the Headmaster's office have to do with becoming
heroines?"</p>
<p>"Huh," Lavender said, now looking thoughtful herself. "That's
true. We should do something heroic. I mean heroinic."</p>
<p>"Um -" said Hannah, which very much expressed Hermione's own
feelings on the subject.</p>
<p>"Well," said Parvati, "has everyone already been through
Dumbledore's third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone in
Gryffindor's been through it by now -"</p>
<p>"Hold <i>on!</i>" Hermione said desperately. "I don't want you
doing anything <i>dangerous!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause while everyone looked at Hermione, who was
realizing, much too late, why Dumbledore hadn't wanted anyone
<i>else</i> to be a hero.</p>
<p>"I don't think you can become a heroine if you never do anything
dangerous," Lavender observed reasonably.</p>
<p>"Besides," said Padma, a considering look on her face. "Everyone
knows that nothing <i>really</i> bad ever happens in Hogwarts,
right? To students, I mean, not to the Defense Professors. We've
got all these ancient wards and so on."</p>
<p>"Um -" Hannah said again.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Parvati, "the worst that can happen is that we'll
lose a few dozen House points or something, and there's two of us
from each House so <i>that'll</i> all come out even."</p>
<p>"Why, that's <i>brilliant,</i> Hermione!" said Daphne in a tone
of great amazement. "The way you set it up means we can get away
with <i>anything!</i> And I didn't even notice your cunning plan
until now!"</p>
<p>"<i>UM</i> -" said Hermione, Hannah, and Susan.</p>
<p>"Right!" said Parvati. "So now it's time for us to become real
heroines. We'll come for the darkness -"</p>
<p>"And make <i>it</i> face <i>us</i> -" said Lavender.</p>
<p>"And teach it to be afraid," Tracey Davis said grimly.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="71">Chapter 71</h2><h3>Self Actualization, Pt
6</h3>
<p>"Well," Daphne whispered, keeping her voice as low as she could,
"at least now I don't feel like the only sane person in Hogwarts
any more."</p>
<p>"Because now you've got the rest of us as friends?" whispered
Lavender Brown, who was tiptoeing along at her left side.</p>
<p>"I don't think that's what she means," General Granger murmured
from Lavender's own left.</p>
<p>They crept slowly and carefully through the corridors of
Hogwarts, all eight of them keeping both ears peeled for the
slightest sound of Trouble, just like it was a battle and they were
looking for enemy soldiers to ambush; only in this case they were
looking for bullies to Vanquish and victims to Rescue in the span
between the end of breakfast-time and when Lavender and Parvati had
to get to their Herbology class.</p>
<p>Lavender had argued that if one first-year girl could take down
three older bullies, then eight first-year girls ought to be able
to outfight twenty-four older bullies because of
Multiplication.</p>
<p>Judging by her frantic spluttering and waving of hands, General
Granger hadn't found this convincing.</p>
<p>Padma had stayed silent for a bit during the ensuing argument,
and then observed thoughtfully that even in Hogwarts, beating up
first-year girls probably wouldn't be good for your reputation as a
bully.</p>
<p>Parvati had straightened up at this, exclaiming that this meant
they were the <i>only ones</i> who could do something about
Hogwarts's bully problem, which made it <i>really truly</i>
heroinic. Plus the <i>whole reason</i> their parents had moved to
Britain was so that the two of them could attend the world's only
magical school with a 0% fatality rate, and what was the point if
they didn't take advantage and try a few things?</p>
<p>To which General Granger had responded that Parvati didn't
understand the point of a perfect safety record <i>at all</i> -</p>
<p>Lavender had said that if they were <i>really</i> all friends
together and not Hermione's followers like Professor Quirrell
thought, then they should vote on things like this.</p>
<p>Daphne had expected that hers would be the deciding vote after
Hermione and Susan and Hannah voted no. And so Daphne had
considered it carefully after her first flush of enthusiasm wore
off. She <i>was</i> a Slytherin, after all, and that meant it was
<i>her</i> responsibility to keep a watchful eye on their own
interests while they were all running around trying to help people
- her job to figure out how risky it really was, and whether it
would be worth it for <i>them</i>, just like Mother would have done
in her place. Always looking out for yourself and your friends like
that, was what real Slytherining was all about...</p>
<p>Hannah Abbott, the nervous little Hufflepuff girl, had in a
small trembling voice said "Yes."</p>
<p>And now Daphne and Susan and Hermione <i>had</i> to stay with
the other five, they couldn't <i>possibly</i> let the others go off
on their own. Because no Gryffindor would ever live down hurting
the last surviving child of the Bones family, and no Slytherin
would dare assault a daughter of the Noble and Most Ancient House
of Greengrass. (Daphne <i>hoped</i> so, anyway.) And General
Granger who'd started the whole thing... you didn't even have to
ask.</p>
<p>The corridors of Hogwarts passed them by one after another,
their tense hands never straying far from their wands, as stone and
wood and Everburning Torches came into vision and then moved past.
At one point they heard footsteps and drew in their breath, hands
almost dropping to their wands, but it was just a lone older
Ravenclaw who looked at them curiously before sniffing and dropping
his head back to his book as he walked on.</p>
<p>The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved with gilded
frescos, and came to a dead end leading into a boys' bathroom, and
turned around, and wandered <i>back</i> through the solemn oaken
panels carved with gilded frescos, and then turned through dusty
old brick corridors grouted with worn cement, which sort of led
them in a circle actually, so they consulted a portrait and then
went down a <i>different</i> dusty old brick corridor instead, that
took them to a brief rise of marble stairs that should've put them
on the third-and-a-halfth floor if it'd been anywhere but Hogwarts,
and then it was back to tiled stone pavement again, and skylights
that let shafts of sunlight pour down even though they were nowhere
near the roof, and after they'd followed that passageway around a
few corners it took them to another boys' bathroom, clearly marked
with a plaque showing the silhouette of a robed figure whizzing
into a toilet.</p>
<p>The eight of them stood before the closed door and stared with a
certain amount of weariness.</p>
<p>"I'm bored," said Lavender.</p>
<p>Padma made a show of taking a pocketwatch out of her robes and
looking at it. "Sixteen minutes and thirty seconds," she said. "A
new record for the longest attention span in Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> don't think this is going to work either," said Susan.
"And I'm a <i>Hufflepuff</i>."</p>
<p>"Y'know," Lavender said thoughtfully, "I wonder if maybe what
<i>really</i> makes someone a hero, is that when they try something
like this, something interesting <i>actually happens</i>."</p>
<p>"I bet you're right," said Tracey. "I bet if we had <i>Harry
Potter</i> with us, we'd run into three bullies and a hidden room
full of treasure in the first five minutes. I bet that all General
Chaos has to do is go to the bathroom and he, like, finds
Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets or something -"</p>
<p>Daphne couldn't quite let that one go past. "You think Lord
Slytherin would've put the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in a
<i>bathroom -</i>"</p>
<p>"What I'm <i>saying,</i>" said Susan, as Tracey was opening her
mouth to reply, "is that we've got no way of actually
<i>finding</i> any bullies. I mean, all <i>they've</i> got to do is
find a Hufflepuff somewhere, but we've got to run across them at
exactly the right <i>time</i>, d'you see? Which is a <i>very good
problem</i> because if we <i>did</i> find them we'd all get
squished like bugs. Can't we just do the forbidden third-floor
corridor like we're <i>supposed</i> to?"</p>
<p>Lavender snorted scornfully. "You don't become a <i>real</i>
heroine just by doing the forbidden things the Headmaster
<i>tells</i> you not to do!"</p>
<p>(Daphne's mind tried to wrap around this statement as she
silently thanked the Sorting Hat for not putting her anywhere near
Gryffindor.)</p>
<p>"Come to think..." Parvati said slowly, "I mean, what're the
odds that Harry Potter would run across those five bullies on his
<i>first morning</i> of school? He must've had <i>some</i> way of
finding them."</p>
<p>Daphne happened to be standing where looking at Parvati let her
see Hermione, so she noticed the Ravenclaw girl's expression change
- and then she realized that the Sunshine General had <i>also</i>
found some bullies just recently -</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. "Of course! He
got told by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Daphne at the same time as several other
people.</p>
<p>"That's who the ghost was that scared me, I'm pretty sure,"
Padma explained. "I mean I only figured it out afterward, but...
yeah. Salazar Slytherin's ghost doesn't like it when Slytherins
bully people, he thinks it shames his name, and the ghost is still
keyed into the Hogwarts wards so he knows everything that happens,
I bet."</p>
<p>Daphne's mouth was hanging open; and she saw that Hannah had put
a hand to her forehead and was leaning against the stone walls,
while Tracey's eyes were blazing like little brown stars.</p>
<p><i>Salazar Slytherin's ghost?</i></p>
<p>Had leagued himself with <i>Harry Potter?</i></p>
<p>And had sent <i>Hermione Granger</i> to stop Derrick's crew?</p>
<p>She would have paid a hundred Galleons to be there when Draco
Malfoy got told about this.</p>
<p>Although considering how fast rumors spread through Hogwarts,
now that Padma had spilled the beans, Millicent had probably told
him thirty minutes ago...</p>
<p>In fact... now that Daphne <i>thought</i> about it...</p>
<p>"So," said Parvati. "We've got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to
find Salazar Slytherin's ghost? Wow, I guess if I'm saying stuff
like that out loud, I might actually be turning into a heroine
-"</p>
<p>"Yes!" said Lavender. "We've got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where
to find Salazar Slytherin's ghost!"</p>
<p>"We've got to ask... the Boy-Who-Lived... where to find Salazar
Slytherin's ghost..." repeated Hannah in a nervous voice, like she
was forcing herself to say it.</p>
<p>"And if <i>that</i> doesn't work," shouted Tracey, "we'll stun
Harry Potter, tie him up and bring him <i>with</i> us!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It said something, Hermione Granger thought, and it was
something rather sad - as the eight of them strolled back through
the maze of twisty little passages that was Hogwarts, their time
before the next class having run out without finding any bullies -
that she genuinely didn't know whether Harry Potter had been led
around by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin or a phoenix or
<i>what.</i> And whatever Harry had done, she hoped it
<i>didn't</i> work for them. And most of all she hoped that the
others didn't vote for Tracey's idea of stunning Harry Potter and
carting his unconscious body around with them to attract
Adventures. That couldn't possibly work in real life, or, if it
did, she was giving up.</p>
<p>Hermione looked from witch to witch, Tracey chatting with
Lavender, and the others making occasional remarks; and her gaze
caught on a girl who was subdued and quiet, the one person whose
thoughts right now she couldn't guess at all.</p>
<p>"Hannah?" she said to the girl walking alongside her. Hermione
tried to make her voice as gentle as she could. "You don't have to
answer, but is it okay if I ask why you voted yes on fighting
bullies?"</p>
<p>Hermione had thought she'd made her voice soft, but everyone
stopped walking, and Lavender and Tracey halted their conversation
and looked at them.</p>
<p>Hannah's cheeks were already reddening, and just as Hannah
opened her mouth -</p>
<p>"It's 'cause she's got more courage than <i>you</i> think,
obviously," said Lavender.</p>
<p>Hannah paused with her mouth open.</p>
<p>She closed her mouth.</p>
<p>She swallowed, hard and visibly, while her cheeks reddened even
further.</p>
<p>Then Hannah took a deep breath, and said, in a small voice,
"There's a boy I like."</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl flinched as she said it, and her head darted
around nervously to look at everyone looking at her, while the
pause and silence stretched.</p>
<p>"Um, okay?" Susan said eventually.</p>
<p>"I've got <i>five</i> boys I like," said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Padma and I knew we'd both like the same boys," said Parvati,
"so we made a list and flipped a Knut to see who got to pick
first."</p>
<p>"I know who <i>I'm</i> destined to marry," said Tracey. "I don't
care what the world says, he's meant to be mine!"</p>
<p>This made all the other girls look expectantly at Hermione,
whose brain had gone ahead and flushed Tracey's last statement
entirely so it could focus on just on the first thing Hannah had
said.</p>
<p>"Um," said Hermione. She carefully continued keeping her voice
gentle. "Hannah, the reason why you joined the Society for
Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches was that there's a boy who
might like you more if you become a hero?"</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl nodded again, her cheeks reddening even
further while she stared down at her own reflection in her
black-polished shoes.</p>
<p>"She likes Neville Longbottom, actually," Daphne said. The
Slytherin gave a woeful sigh. "And unfortunately for her, he's
going to marry someone else. It's very tragic."</p>
<p>This produced a high-pitched <i>eeping</i> sound from Hannah as
she went on staring at her feet.</p>
<p>"Wait what?" said Lavender. "Neville's going to marry someone
else? How do you know about this? <i>Who?</i>"</p>
<p>Daphne just shook her head sadly with a downcast expression.</p>
<p>"<i>Excuse me</i>," said Hermione, and then when the others
looked at her again, "Ah..." while she tried to organize her
thoughts. "I mean, um... Hannah... trying to become a hero so that
a boy will like you isn't very <i>feminist</i>."</p>
<p>"It's pronounced <i>feminine</i> actually," said Padma.</p>
<p>"And why're you calling Hannah unfeminine?" said Susan. "There's
nothing unfeminine about wanting to impress a boy."</p>
<p>"Besides," said Parvati, sounding puzzled, "isn't the whole
point that we're trying to be heroes even though that isn't
feminine?"</p>
<p>The ensuing discussion would not be remembered by Hermione
Granger as one of her most successful forays into the realms of
political education. She tried to explain, and then after the
resulting argument tried to explain again, while the other seven
girls looked at her more and more skeptically. Afterward Daphne
declared in the imperious tones of the future Lady Greengrass that
if this feminism business meant girls weren't allowed to pursue
boys in whichever way they pleased, then feminism could stay in the
Muggle lands where it belonged. Lavender suggested that maybe
witchism could say that witches got to do anything they wanted,
which sounded like more fun than feminism. And finally Padma closed
off further discussion by observing wearily that she didn't see
much point to going on arguing, since S.P.H.E.W. wasn't
<i>about</i> anything to do with feminism in the first place, it
was just about more girls becoming heroes.</p>
<p>Hermione had given up at that point.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As their Charms session that day ended and the first-year
Ravenclaws began shuffling out of the class, Hermione was already
wincing to herself. They'd made it to class just barely before the
opening gong, they'd had to run right over to their desks and sit
down, so there hadn't been time for the awful thing to happen
<i>yet;</i> but that just meant that Hermione got to look forward
to the coming disaster for the <i>whole class.</i></p>
<p>Sure enough, after Professor Flitwick squeaked his dismissal and
everyone rose from their chairs, Harry began walking toward her;
and for her own part Hermione shoved her book into her mokeskin
pouch and very quickly walked over to the door and threw it open
and headed into the corridors, and of course Harry followed her
with a surprised look because they had a library session scheduled
-</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Harry said as he closed the door behind him. "What's
wrong?"</p>
<p>The door flew open behind Harry not a moment after he closed it,
almost hitting Harry as he stepped out of the way, and Padma Patil
stepped out of the classroom with a dreadful look of determination
upon her face.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Potter," came the awful words, the young girl's
high voice resounding through the corridor like the gloomy bells of
doom, "can I ask you for help with something?"</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows drew up, and he said, "You can <i>ask,</i> of
course."</p>
<p>"Can you tell us how to talk to Salazar Slytherin's ghost? We
want him to tell us where to find bullies, like he tells you."</p>
<p>There was a little bit of silence in the corridor outside the
classroom.</p>
<p>The door opened again, and Su peered out with an inquiring look
-</p>
<p>"Well, we've got to get to the library," Harry said quite
casually, his face looking relaxed, "would you mind following us?"
and began to walk off in the direction that led to the library on
odd-numbered days of the month, and Su made like she was going to
follow but Harry's face turned toward her for a moment.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Harry had rounded a corner that he drew his
wand, said in a low precise voice "<i>Quietus</i>" and then turned
to Padma and said, "An interesting guess, Miss Patil."</p>
<p>Padma looked rather smug, then; and said, "I <i>should've</i>
figured it out earlier, really. There was that <i>hiss</i> in the
ghost's voice, I should've thought Parselmouth right away, even
before he started talking about Godric Gryffindor."</p>
<p>Harry's face didn't change. "May I ask, Miss Patil, whether
you've shared this thought with -"</p>
<p>"She said it in front of everyone in S.P.H.E.W.," Hermione
said.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes had that look they had when he was very rapidly
calculating something, and then he said, "Hermione, what's the
chance that -"</p>
<p>"She said it in front of Lavender <i>and</i> Tracey."</p>
<p>"Um," said Padma. "Should I not've done that?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Wait here," growled Mr. Goyle, and went around the corner; and
there was the sound of him knocking on Draco Malfoy's private
room.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a queasy feeling in Tracey's stomach, and she
reminded herself again that since Padma had spilled the beans
<i>someone</i> was bound to tell Draco Malfoy, and it might as well
be <i>her</i>, and it wasn't as if she <i>owed</i> Harry Potter
anything, and a Slytherin had to do what was necessary to achieve
her Ambitions.</p>
<p>She'd been collecting Ambitions ever since Professor Quirrell
told her off, and so far she'd decided that she wanted to own her
own Nimbus 2000 broomstick, become super famous, marry Harry
Potter, eat Chocolate Frogs for breakfast every day, and defeat at
least <i>three</i> Dark Lords just to show Professor Quirrell who
was ordinary.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy will see you," said the low, menacing voice of Mr.
Goyle as he returned. "And you'd better hope he doesn't think
you're wasting his time." The boy loomed at her briefly, and then
stepped aside.</p>
<p>Tracey added having her own servants to her list of Ambitions,
and entered.</p>
<p>The Malfoy private bedroom looked just like Daphne's. She'd been
privately hoping for diamond chandeliers or golden frescos on the
walls - she'd never have said it in front of Daphne, but the House
of Malfoy <i>was</i> a step up from Greengrass. But it was just a
small bedroom like Daphne's, and the only difference was that
Malfoy's stuff was decorated in silver snakes instead of emerald
plants.</p>
<p>As she stepped through the doorway, Draco Malfoy - who was
perfectly groomed even inside his own bedroom - rose up from his
desk chair to greet her with a small friendly bow, wearing a
charming smile just like she was someone who <i>mattered,</i> which
made Tracey so flustered that she forgot everything she'd rehearsed
inside her head and just blurted out, "I've got something to tell
you!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Gregory said so," Draco Malfoy said smoothly. "Please,
Miss Davis, sit down." He gestured to <i>his own desk chair</i>,
even as he sat down on his bed.</p>
<p>She felt somewhat lightheaded as she carefully sat herself down
in Malfoy's own chair, her fingers unthinkingly fiddling with how
her dress robes fell across her knees, trying to make them look as
elegant and uncreased as Draco Malfoy's -</p>
<p>"So, Miss Davis," said Draco Malfoy. "What did you want to tell
me?"</p>
<p>Tracey hesitated, and then when Malfoy's face started to look a
bit impatient, just stammered it all out, everything Padma had said
about Salazar Slytherin's ghost sending Harry Potter to stop
bullies and also what Daphne had told her about Hermione Granger
being in on it -</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy's expression didn't change at all as she spoke, not
even in the slightest, and it dawned on Tracey with a sickening
lurch in her stomach.</p>
<p>"You don't <i>believe</i> me!" she said.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Well," said Draco Malfoy, with a smile that wasn't quite as
charming as his last one, "I <i>do</i> believe that's what Padma
said and what Daphne said, so thank you anyway, Miss Davis." The
boy rose from where he'd been sitting on his bed, and Tracey, not
even thinking, rose from the chair.</p>
<p>As he was escorting her to the door, just as he was about to
turn the knob, it occurred to Tracey that - "You didn't ask what I
wanted for the information," she said.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy gave her some kind of look, she didn't quite know
what it was supposed to mean, and he didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," Tracey said, making an on-the-spot change to her
previous Plans, "I <i>don't</i> want anything for the information,
I was just being friendly."</p>
<p>A brief look of surprise crossed Draco Malfoy's face for just an
instant before his expression flattened again and he said, "It's
not that easy to become friends with a Malfoy, Miss Davis."</p>
<p>Tracey smiled, and meant it. "Well, I'll just go on being
friendly, then," she said, and left the room with a skip in her
step, feeling like a real Slytherin for maybe the first time in her
life, and having just decided that Draco Malfoy would be one of her
husbands too.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>After the girl was gone, Gregory came in, shut the door again
and said, "Are you alright, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco said nothing to his servant and friend. His eyes gazed off
into nowhere, like he was trying to stare through the wall of his
bedroom, through the Hogwarts lake that surrounded the Slytherin
dungeons, through Earth's crust and atmosphere and the interstellar
dust of the Milky Way, into the utterly empty and lightless void
between galaxies which no wizard and no scientist had ever
seen.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy?" Gregory said, starting to sound a little
worried.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I believed every word of that," said Draco.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Daphne finished her final inch of Transfiguration and looked up
across the Slytherin common room, at where Millicent Bulstrode was
still working on her own homework. It was time to come to a
Decision.</p>
<p>If S.P.H.E.W. did go around trying to stun bullies, the bullies
wouldn't like it, that was certain. And they'd try to do something
unpleasant about it, which was also certain. On the other hand, if
the bullies got really nasty then Hermione could ask Harry Potter
for help, or they could pool their combined Quirrell points and ask
the Defense Professor for a favor... No, the thing that Daphne was
<i>really</i> worried about was if this business got them in bad
with Professor Snape. You didn't want to <i>ever</i> end up on the
wrong side of Professor Snape.</p>
<p>But since the day she'd challenged Neville to a Most Ancient
Duel, she'd noticed people looking at her differently. Even the
Slytherins who'd made fun of her were looking at her differently.
It was dawning on Daphne that being the daughter of the Noble and
Most Ancient House of Greengrass brought in a <i>lot</i> more
respect if you were a beautiful <i>heroine</i> born to a Most
Ancient House, and not just a pretty noble girl. It was the
difference between having your role played by the lead actress and
having your role played by a two-Galleon extra with a screechy
laugh.</p>
<p>Fighting bullies might not be the <i>best</i> way to become a
heroine. But Father had once told her that the trouble with passing
up opportunities was that it was habit-forming. If you told
yourself you were waiting for a better opportunity next time, why,
next time you'd probably tell yourself the same thing. Father had
said that most people spent their whole <i>lives</i> waiting for an
opportunity that was good enough, and then they died. Father had
said that while seizing opportunities <i>would</i> mean that all
sorts of things went wrong, it wasn't nearly as bad as being a
hopeless lump. Father had said that <i>after</i> she got into the
habit of seizing opportunities, <i>then</i> it was time to start
being picky about them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mother had warned her not to take all of
Father's advice, and said that Daphne wasn't allowed to ask about
Father's sixth year in Hogwarts until she was at least thirty years
old.</p>
<p>But in the end Father <i>had</i> gotten Mother to marry him and
successfully plotted his way into a Most Ancient House, so there
<i>was</i> that.</p>
<p>Millicent Bulstrode finished her homework and began putting her
things away.</p>
<p>Daphne stood up from her desk, and walked over.</p>
<p>Millicent swung out her legs from the table and stood up,
slinging her bookbag over one shoulder, then looked over at where
Daphne was approaching, the girl's expression puzzled.</p>
<p>"Hey, Millicent," Daphne said as she drew near, making her voice
low and excited, "guess what I figured out today?"</p>
<p>"The thing about Salazar Slytherin's ghost helping Granger?"
said Millicent. "I already heard about that -"</p>
<p>"No," Daphne said in a hushed whisper, "this is even
<i>better.</i>"</p>
<p>"Really?" Millicent said, in an equally low excited voice. "What
is it?"</p>
<p>Daphne looked around conspiratorially. "Come to my room and I'll
tell you."</p>
<p>They went off toward the stairs that led downward, the private
rooms were even lower in the lake than the seventh-year
dorms...</p>
<p>Soon enough Daphne was sitting in her comfy desk-chair and
Millicent had bounced over to the edge of her bed.</p>
<p>"<i>Quietus,</i>" said Daphne, when they were both seated; and
then instead of putting her wand away inside her robes, Daphne just
let her hand fall naturally down to her side, still holding the
wand, just in case.</p>
<p>"All <i>right!</i>" said Millicent. "What <i>is</i> it?"</p>
<p>"You know what I figured out?" said Daphne. "I figured out that
you get the gossip <i>so</i> fast, you know about things <i>before
they actually happen</i>."</p>
<p>Daphne had half-expected Millicent to turn white and fall over,
and she didn't really, but the girl did flinch pretty hard before
she started stammering denials.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Daphne with her sweetest smile, "I won't
tell anyone else you're a seer. I mean, we're friends, right?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year of Slytherin, was working
diligently on yet another two-foot essay (she was taking everything
except Divination and Muggle Studies and her N.E.W.T. year seemed
to consist <i>entirely</i> of homework) when her Head of House
strode up to the table she was working at and barked "You will come
with me, Miss Felthorne!" and walked away even as she frantically
began putting away her parchment and book and quill.</p>
<p>When she caught up with Professor Snape, he was waiting just
outside the room and gazing at her with half-lidded eyes that
seemed far too intense; and before she could ask what this was
about he spun without a word and stalked off through the hallways,
so that she had to scramble to keep up.</p>
<p>Their walk took them down a flight of stairs, and then another,
below what she'd thought was the lowest level of the Slytherin
dungeons. And the corridors began to look older in their
appearance, the architecture reverting back in time by centuries
into roughened stone held together by crude-looking mortar. She
began to wonder if Professor Snape was taking her to the
<i>real</i> dungeons that she'd heard rumors of, the true dungeons
of Hogwarts that had been sealed off to all but faculty; and if
maybe Professor Snape did terrible things down there to innocent
helpless young girls but that was probably just wishful thinking on
her part.</p>
<p>They went down another flight of stairs, and came out into a
room that was no room at all, but an empty rock cavern with a
single door, pierced by many dark openings and lit by a single
torch of ancient style that fired as they entered.</p>
<p>Professor Snape took out his wand, then, and began to cast Charm
after Charm, she lost track of how many; and when the Potions
Master was done he turned back toward her, locked his intense eyes
on hers, and said in a level voice unlike his usual drawl, "You
will say nothing to anyone of this matter, Miss Felthorne, nothing
now or ever. If that is acceptable to you, nod. If not, we will
turn and go."</p>
<p>She nodded, frightened and with a strange hope dawning in her
heart (well, not exactly her heart).</p>
<p>"The task I have for you is very simple, Miss Felthorne," said
Professor Snape's toneless voice, "and your extremely generous pay
of fifty Galleons is merely to compensate you for being
Memory-Charmed afterward."</p>
<p>She drew an involuntary breath. Her family might be rich but
they had other daughters and kept her on a tight leash and it was
certainly a lot of money for <i>her</i>.</p>
<p>Then her ears caught up with the words <i>Memory-Charmed</i> and
for a moment she felt outraged, there was no point if she couldn't
keep the memories, what sort of girl did Professor Snape think she
<i>was?</i></p>
<p>"You surely know," said Severus Snape, "of Miss Hermione
Granger, the Sunshine General?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Rianne Felthorne in sudden horror and
disgust. "She's in her <i>first year!</i> <i>Ew!</i>"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="72">Chapter 72</h2><h3>SA, Plausible Deniability, Pt
7</h3>
<p>The winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so it
was amid the peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the
enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall that Hermione left for the
Ravenclaw Tower alongside her study partner Harry Potter, who
lately seemed to have a <i>ridiculous</i> amount of time for
studying. She hadn't the faintest idea of when Harry was doing his
actual homework, except that it was getting done, maybe by house
elves while he slept.</p>
<p>Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them
as they passed through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which
were more like siege gates of a castle than anything students ought
to go through on the way back from supper.</p>
<p>They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant
babble of student conversation had faded into silence; and then the
two of them went on a little further through the stone corridors
before Hermione finally spoke.</p>
<p>"Why'd you do that, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Do what?" said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if
his mind were quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important
things.</p>
<p>"I mean, why didn't you just <i>tell</i> them no?"</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, "I
can't just go around saying 'no' every time someone asks me about
something I haven't done. I mean, suppose someone asks me, 'Harry,
did you pull the prank with the invisible paint?' and I say 'No'
and then they say 'Harry, do you know who messed with the
Gryffindor Seeker's broomstick?' and I say 'I refuse to answer that
question.' It's sort of a giveaway."</p>
<p>"And <i>that's</i> why," Hermione said carefully, "you told
everyone..." She concentrated, rembering the exact words. "That if
hypothetically there <i>was</i> a conspiracy, you could not confirm
or deny that the true master of the conspiracy was Salazar
Slytherin's ghost, and in fact you wouldn't even be able to admit
the conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you questions
about it."</p>
<p>"Yep," said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. "That'll teach them
to take hypothetical scenarios too seriously."</p>
<p>"And you told <i>me</i> not to answer anything -"</p>
<p>"They might not <i>believe</i> you, if you deny it," said Harry.
"So it's better to say nothing, unless you want them to think
you're a liar."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione said helplessly. "But - but now people think
I'm <i>doing</i> things for <i>Salazar Slytherin!</i>" The way the
Gryffindors had been looking at her - the way the <i>Slytherins</i>
had been looking at her -</p>
<p>"It goes along with being a hero," Harry said. "Have you seen
what the <i>Quibbler</i> says about <i>me?</i>"</p>
<p>For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a
newspaper article about her, and instead of the story being about
her winning a nationwide spelling bee or any of the other ways
she'd imagined getting into the papers, the headline said "HERMIONE
GRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT".</p>
<p>It was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine
business.</p>
<p>Harry's voice turned a bit more formal. "Speaking of which, Miss
Granger, how goes your latest quest?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Hermione, "unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin
really <i>does</i> show up and tell us where to find bullies, I
don't think we're going to have much luck." Not that she was sorry
about that.</p>
<p>She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a
peculiarly intense look.</p>
<p>"You know, Hermione," the boy said quietly, as though to make
sure that nobody else in the world heard, "I think you're right. I
think some people get a lot more help than others in becoming
heroes. And <i>I</i> don't think that's fair, either."</p>
<p>And Harry grabbed at her witch's robes where they lay over her
arm, and hustled her into a side-hall of the corridor they were
walking through, her mouth gaping open in surprise even as Harry's
wand came into his hand, they rounded a curve of the side-hall and
it was so narrow that it was almost pushing her and Harry into each
other, even as Harry pointed to the way they'd come and softly said
"<i>Quietus</i>", then a moment later, in the other direction,
"<i>Quietus</i>" again.</p>
<p>The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side,
but even upward toward the ceiling and down toward the floor.</p>
<p>And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, "Invisibility
cloak."</p>
<p>"<i>Gleep?</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabric
from the mokeskin device. "Don't worry," the boy said with a small
grin, "they're so rare that nobody bothered to make a school rule
against them..."</p>
<p>And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said,
his voice strangely formal, "I do not give you, but loan you, my
cloak, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect her well."</p>
<p>She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that
swallowed all the light that fell on it except what glinted from
small strange reflections, fabric so perfectly black it should've
shown dust or lint or <i>something</i> but it didn't, the longer
you looked the more you felt like what you were seeing wasn't
really there at all, but then you blinked again and it was just a
black cloak.</p>
<p>"Take it, Hermione."</p>
<p>Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp
the fabric; and then just as her brain woke up and she started to
pull her hand back, Harry let go of the cloak and it started to
fall and she grabbed at it without thinking. And the instant her
fingers touched and held the cloak she felt an intangible jolt run
through her like picking up her wand for the first time; and it was
like she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly, in the back of
her mind.</p>
<p>"That's one of my quest items, Hermione," Harry said softly. "It
belonged to my father, and it's not something I can replace, if
it's lost. Don't loan it to anyone else, don't show it to anyone,
don't tell anyone it exists... but if you want to borrow it for a
while, just come to me and ask."</p>
<p>Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black
folds and stared back up at Harry.</p>
<p>"I can't -"</p>
<p>"You certainly can," Harry said. "Because there's nothing even
the tiniest bit fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box
next to my bed one morning, and you... not." Harry paused
thoughtfully. "Unless you <i>did</i> get your own invisibility
cloak, in which case never mind."</p>
<p>Then the implications of <i>invisibility cloak</i> finally
dawned on her, and she pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though
they were close enough together that she couldn't quite straighten
her arm properly, and her voice rose with considerable indignation
as she said, "So <i>that's</i> how you disappeared from the Potions
closet! And the time when -" and then she trailed off, because even
<i>with</i> an invisibility cloak she still couldn't see how Harry
had...</p>
<p>Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful
nonchalance, and said, "Well, you knew there had to be <i>some</i>
trick to it, right? And now the heroine will mysteriously know
where and when to find bullies - just like she listened to the
bullies planning it, even though nobody her age could
<i>possibly</i> have turned herself invisible to spy on them."</p>
<p>There was a pause and a silence.</p>
<p>"Harry -" she said. "I'm - I'm not sure anymore that fighting
bullies is such a good idea."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes stayed steady on hers. "Because the other girls
might get hurt?"</p>
<p>She nodded, just nodded.</p>
<p>"That's <i>their</i> choice, Hermione, just like it's yours.
<i>I</i> decided not to do the obvious stupid thing that everyone
does in books, try to keep you safe and protected and helpless, and
have you get really angry at me, and push me away while you go off
on your own and get into even more trouble, and then heroically
pull through it successfully, after which I'd finally have my
epiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that
part of my life story goes, so I'm just skipping over it. If I can
predict what I'm going to think later, I might as well go ahead and
think it now. Anyway, my point is, you shouldn't smother
<i>your</i> friends to keep them safe, either. Just tell them up
front it's predictably going to go horribly wrong, and if they
still want to be heroines after that, fine."</p>
<p>It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was
<i>ever</i> going to get used to the way Harry thought. "Harry, I
really," her voice stuck for a second, "really, <i>really</i> don't
want them getting hurt! Especially because of something I
started!"</p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said seriously, "I'm pretty sure you did the
right thing. I don't see what could realistically happen to them
that would be <i>worse</i> for them, in the long run, than <i>not
trying</i>."</p>
<p>"What if they get <i>badly</i> hurt?" Hermione said. Her voice
felt blocked in her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how
Harry had just stared straight into the eyes of a bully as the
bully bent his finger back, before Professor Sprout had arrived to
save him; and there was another thought that came after that, about
Hannah and her delicate hands with the fingernails that she
carefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morning, but that
wasn't allowed to be imagined. "And then - they'll never do
anything courageous, ever again -"</p>
<p>"I don't think it works like that," Harry said steadily. "Even
if it all goes mind-bogglingly wrong, I don't think it works like
that inside a human mind. The important thing is believing about
yourself that you're someone who can break your boundaries. Trying
and getting hurt can't possibly be worse for you than being...
<i>stuck</i>."</p>
<p>"What if you're <i>wrong,</i> Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and
said, "What if I'm right?"</p>
<p>Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand.
From the inside the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against
her palm, as if it was trying to give her hand a reassuring
hug.</p>
<p>Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to
Harry.</p>
<p>Harry didn't move to take it.</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but
I'm still thinking about it, so you can take it back for now.
And... Harry, I don't think it's right to <i>spy</i> on people
-"</p>
<p>"Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?" Harry
said. "<i>I've</i> never been bullied, but I've been through a
realistic simulation, and it didn't feel very pleasant. Have you
ever been bullied, Hermione?"</p>
<p>"No," she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry's
invisibility cloak to him.</p>
<p>Finally Harry took back his cloak - she felt a small twitch of
loss as the inaudible song vanished from the back of her mind - and
started to stuff the black material back into his pouch.</p>
<p>As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her,
to break the Quieting Barrier -</p>
<p>"And, um," Hermione said. "That's not <i>the</i> Cloak of
Invisibility, is it? The one we read about in the library on page
eighteen of Paula Vieira's translation of Gottschalk's <i>An
Illustrated Scroll of Lost Devices</i>?"</p>
<p>Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in
exactly the same tone of voice he'd used earlier with the other
students at dinner, "I cannot confirm or deny that I possess
magical artifacts of incredible power."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Hermione climbed into bed that night she was still trying
to decide. Her life had been simpler at dinnertime, back when there
hadn't <i>been</i> any practical way for them to find bullies; and
now she had to choose again; not for herself, this time, but for
her friends. In her mind's eye she kept seeing Dumbledore's lined
face and the pain it hadn't quite hidden, and in her mind's ears
she kept hearing Harry's voice saying 'That's their choice,
Hermione, just like it's yours.'</p>
<p>And her hand kept remembering the sensation of the cloak against
her fingers, replaying it over and over in her mind. There was a
power to the feeling that compelled her thoughts to return to it,
and to the song she'd heard / hadn't heard in a part of her mind
and magic which now lay silent once more.</p>
<p>Harry had spoken to the cloak like it was a <i>person</i>,
telling it to take good care of her. Harry had said the cloak had
belonged to his father, that he couldn't replace it if it was
lost...</p>
<p>But... Harry wouldn't <i>really</i> do that, would he?</p>
<p>Just <i>hand</i> her one of the three Deathly Hallows created
centuries before Hogwarts?</p>
<p>She could say that she felt flattered, but this went <i>way</i>
beyond feeling flattered, into making her wonder just what she was
to Harry, exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe Harry was the sort of person who went around loaning
ancient lost magical artifacts to <i>anyone</i> he considered a
friend, but -</p>
<p>But when she thought about <i>which</i> part of his life Harry
had said he'd skipped over, the part where he tried to keep her
safe and protected...</p>
<p>Hermione stared up at the ceiling of the Ravenclaw dorm.
Somewhere beyond her bed, Mandy and Su were talking. She'd turned
up her Quieting Charm to where she couldn't hear the exact words,
but could still hear their faint murmur; there was something
comforting about sleeping in a dorm with the other girls. Harry
kept his own Quieter turned up all the way, she knew.</p>
<p>She was starting to wonder if maybe Harry actually <i>did</i>,
well...</p>
<p>You know...</p>
<p><i>Like</i> her.</p>
<p>It took Hermione Granger a long time to fall asleep that
night.</p>
<p>And when she woke up the next morning there was a small slip of
parchment peeking out from under her pillow which said <i>At
half-past ten you will find a bully in the fourth passageway to the
left of the hall leaving the Potions classroom - S.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomach
was filled with flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as
she approached the Ravenclaw breakfast table she still hadn't
decided what to <i>do.</i></p>
<p>There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would be
where to sit down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask
Padma to tell Daphne and Tracey.</p>
<p>Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma.</p>
<p>There were words waiting in her throat, <i>Padma, I got a</i>
<i>mysterious</i> <i>message -</i></p>
<p>And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the
words from coming out. She'd be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne
<i>in danger</i>. Taking them and leading them by the hand straight
into trouble. That was Wrong.</p>
<p>Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without
telling her friends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also
Wrong.</p>
<p>Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just
like all those wizards and witches she'd read about in stories.
Only in stories people always got a <i>right</i> choice and a wrong
choice, not two wrong ones, which seemed a bit unfair. But she had
the sense, somehow - maybe it came from the way Harry always talked
about how the history books would see them - that she was faced
with a Heroic Decision, and that her whole life might end up going
one way or another, depending on what she chose right now, <i>this
morning</i>.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side,
just gazing at the plate and silverware like they might have
answers hidden inside, thinking as hard as she ever had, and a few
seconds later she heard Padma's voice whispering almost in her ear,
"Daphne says she knows where a bully's going to be at ten-thirty
today."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Doomed.</p>
<p>They were all doomed, in Susan Bones's opinion.</p>
<p>Auntie sometimes told stories which started out like this,
people doing something they <i>knew</i> was stupid, and the stories
usually ended with someone being <i>doomed</i> all over the floor
and all over the walls and getting on Auntie's shoes.</p>
<p>"Hey, Padma," muttered Parvati, her voice just barely audible
over the soft impacts of eight girls tiptoeing through the corridor
leading to the Potions classroom, "d'you know why Hermione's been
sighing all morning -"</p>
<p>"No talking!" hissed Lavender, the harsh whisper sounding much
louder than Parvati's mutter. "You never know when Evil might be
listening!"</p>
<p><i>"Shhh!</i>" said three other girls even more loudly.</p>
<p>Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.</p>
<p>As they approached the fourth passageway to the left of the
Potions classroom, where Daphne's mysterious informant had said the
bullying would take place, the eight of them moved slower, the
sound of their feet got softer, and finally General Granger made
the gesture that meant <i>Halt, I'll look ahead</i>.</p>
<p>Lavender raised a hand, then, and when Hermione turned to look
at her, Lavender, looking puzzled, pointed straight down the
corridor, gestured to herself, and then tried to sign something
else that Susan didn't understand -</p>
<p>General Granger shook her head, and once again, this time with
slower, more exaggerated movements, made the sign for <i>Halt, I'll
look ahead</i>.</p>
<p>Lavender, looking even more puzzled, pointed back the way they'd
come, and made a bouncing gesture with her other hand.</p>
<p>Now everyone else was looking even more confused than Lavender,
and Susan thought with some acerbity that evidently one hour of
practice done two days ago wasn't enough to remember a new set of
code signals.</p>
<p>Hermione pointed at Lavender, then at the floor beneath
Lavender's feet, the expression on her face making it very clear
that the intended meaning was <i>You. Stay. Here.</i></p>
<p>Lavender nodded.</p>
<p><i>Doom doom doom,</i> went the words of the Chaos Legion's
marching song through Susan's mind, <i>doom doom doom doom doom
doom</i>...</p>
<p>Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with
a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. Very very softly indeed,
the Ravenclaw girl crept up to the wall, right next to where the
passageway opened off the corridor, and peeked just the tip of the
eyepiece around the corner.</p>
<p>Then a little more.</p>
<p>Then a little more.</p>
<p>Then General Granger cautiously stuck her head around the
side.</p>
<p>General Granger turned back to them, nodded, and made the hand
gesture for <i>follow me</i>.</p>
<p>Susan felt a little better as she crept forward. The part of the
Plan which called for them to arrive thirty minutes before the
bully had, apparently, actually worked. Maybe they were only
<i>slightly</i> doomed...?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If
anyone had been present to hear - though the corridor was
apparently empty - they would have heard his shoes clicking solidly
through the main corridor, entering the passageway, walking toward
where the passageway turned its first corner, turning that corner,
and then stopping in some surprise upon seeing that the passageway
now terminated in a solid brick wall where no wall had been
before.</p>
<p>Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to
watch the main passage from just around the corner.</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> the castle Hogwarts, after all.</p>
<p>Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they'd assembled
into the outward appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not
speaking, not moving, hardly even breathing, but watching through
the eyeholes they'd left themselves.</p>
<p>As Susan's gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening
of her chest all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his
seventh-year if not <i>older</i>, and his robes were trimmed in
green instead of the red they'd been hoping for, and he had
<i>muscles</i>, and after staring for a bit longer, Susan realized
his stance had the balance that meant that he <i>dueled</i>.</p>
<p>Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the
corridor. The fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been
let out of Potions class.</p>
<p>The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the
bully didn't do anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of
relief -</p>
<p>Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached.</p>
<p>The bully still didn't do anything, as the footsteps went
past.</p>
<p>That happened a few more times.</p>
<p>And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one
last set of footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully's voice
saying, clear and cold and quiet, "<i>Protego</i>".</p>
<p>Someone <i>did</i> gasp then, though fortunately very very
quietly. If they couldn't get in even a single shot -</p>
<p>The bullies were learning <i>already</i>, Susan realized, she
hadn't expected S.P.H.E.W. to be able to do this very often before
the bullies caught on - but - Hermione had already defeated three
bullies - and the school had been buzzing with speculation about
Salazar Slytherin's ghost, yesterday -</p>
<p><i>He's expecting us!</i></p>
<p>Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only
there was no way to convey a message to -</p>
<p>"<i>Silencio</i>," said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice
with his wand pointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his
Shielding Charm shimmering around him. "<i>Accio</i> victim."</p>
<p>When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was
dangling upside down as if an invisible hand were holding him high
by one leg, his red-trimmed robes beginning to slide down his
thighs to reveal the pants beneath. His mouth was opening and
closing helpessly, no sound coming out.</p>
<p>"I suppose you're wondering what's going on," the seventh-year
Slytherin said in a quiet, cold voice. "Don't worry. It's so simple
even a Gryffindor could understand."</p>
<p>With that, the Slytherin's left hand formed a fist and drove
hard into the Gryffindor's belly. The fourth-year boy's body jerked
around frantically, but still no words left his mouth.</p>
<p>"You're my victim," said the older Slytherin. "I'm a bully. I'm
going to beat you up. And we'll see if anyone stops me."</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap.</p>
<p>And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and
high-pitched voice of a young girl, crying, "<i>Stop, evildoer!
Finite Incantatem!</i>"</p>
<p><i>Lavender</i>, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl
had volunteered to be a distraction, while the rest of them
executed a flank attack from where the bully wouldn't expect it,
that had been the plan, only now -</p>
<p>"In the name of Hogwarts," cried Lavender's voice, though they
couldn't see her, "and in the name of heroines everywhere, I
command you to let go of that EEK!"</p>
<p>"<i>Expelliarmus</i>," said the bully. "<i>Stupefy</i>.
<i>Accio</i> stupid heroine."</p>
<p>When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot
and unconscious, Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright
crimson-and-gold skirt and blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts
robes.</p>
<p>The bully was also giving the girl's upside-down body an odd
look, and then he pointed his wand at her and said "<i>Finite
Incantatem</i>," but the clothes stayed the same.</p>
<p>Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of
Lavender instead of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his
fist -</p>
<p>"<i>Lagann!</i>" yelled five voices, and five green spirals
blasted from five wands aimed through five holes in the false wall,
and an instant later Hermione's voice shouted
"<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and
Hermione's red bolt bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year
boy, who jerked and then was still.</p>
<p>And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the
first-year girls screamed and charged.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Susan's eyes flew open and instantly she was rolling away from
where she'd lain on the floor, her lungs still on fire and her
whole body still aching from when she'd been hit, the battle had
only moved forward a few seconds from what she could see, Hannah's
body falling with her arm still stretched out toward Susan,
"<i>Glisseo!</i>" shouted Hermione but the older boy just slashed
his wand down leaving a trail of green glow behind and Hermione's
Charm visibly disrupted into a shower of blue-white sparks, then in
almost the same motion the bully said "<i>Stupefy!</i>" and
Hermione was blown backward and Susan summoned up all the magic she
had left and shouted "<i>Innervate!</i>" at Hermione's body even
as the bully turned toward her, the bully's wand pointed in her
direction again and then Padma yelled "<i>Prismatis!</i>" just
before the bully shouted "<i>Impedimenta!</i>", the rainbow sphere
forming <i>around the bully</i> and the seventh-year Slytherin
staggered as his own hex was reflected back at him, but an instant
later the bully's wand swept back to tap himself and then Padma's
Prismatic Sphere shattered like a blown soap bubble as the bully's
wand cut through it and "<i>Innervate!</i>" yelled Parvati at
Hannah's body and Tracey and Lavender screamed at the same time,
"<i>Wingardium Leviosa!</i>" -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with
exhaustion, she didn't have enough magic left for even one
<i>Innervate</i>, now.</p>
<p>The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying
across the ground, Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and
Parvati in a heap against one wall, Susan standing in petrified
rigor as her eyes tracked it all helplessly, even the Gryffindor
boy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had woken him and he'd
fought, but it hadn't been enough).</p>
<p>It had been a very short battle.</p>
<p>The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a
wavering ripple in the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads
of sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and
stalked toward her like a man-shaped living Lethifold.</p>
<p>Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound in
her choking throat, sprinted past the fallen paneling of the fake
brick wall, ran down the passageway with all the speed she could
muster, weaving as much as she could -</p>
<p>Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the
bully's voice from behind her said "<i>Cluthe!</i>" and she got
awful cramps all through her legs, she fell down and slid and hit
her head against the wall, only she didn't even notice the pain of
the smack as she started to scream with the twisting muscles -</p>
<p>The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she
turned her head; approaching her slowly, still wearing that
dreadful smile.</p>
<p>And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted up
around themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway,
and screamed, "Go <i>away!</i>"</p>
<p>"I think not," said the bully, his voice deep and scary like
that of a grown man, sounding very close at hand now.</p>
<p>The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbed
her Most Ancient Blade directly into his groin.</p>
<p>There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was with a subdued mien that seven girls left Madam Pomfrey's
office, leaving one of their own behind in a hospital bed.</p>
<p>Hannah would be all right in about thirty-five minutes, the
healer had said; torn muscles were easy to mend.</p>
<p>Daphne had done all the talking, and according to her, Hannah
had suffered a mishap with a Road-Running Charm which had caused
the leg cramps. Madam Pomfrey had given them a sharp look but
hadn't argued, even though that Charm was around six years above
their level.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey had also given Daphne a potion to help with her
state of total magical exhaustion, and warned her not to cast any
spells for the next three hours. That, supposedly, was from Daphne
using up too much magic trying to <i>Finite</i> Hannah, rather than
the Most Ancient Blade drawing out all of her power to break the
<i>Protego</i>.</p>
<p>The rest of them had decided not to say anything about the
bruises under their robes until they could get some older girls to
cast <i>Episkey</i>. There were limits to what Daphne could talk
around.</p>
<p>The whole thing, Susan thought, had been too close, much too
close. If the bully had so much as looked around the corner - if
he'd taken a moment to recast his Shielding Charm -</p>
<p>"We should stop," said Susan, as soon as the seven of them had
gotten out of hearing range of the healer's office. "We should stop
doing this."</p>
<p>For some reason, then, even though they were supposed to vote on
this sort of thing, everyone turned to look at General Granger.</p>
<p>The Sunshine General didn't seem to see them looking at her, she
just strode on, gazing off straight ahead.</p>
<p>After a little while, Hermione Granger said, in a voice that
sounded thoughtful and a little sad, "Hannah said <i>she</i> didn't
want us to stop. I'm not sure it's right for us to... be less brave
<i>for</i> her, than she is."</p>
<p>All the other girls, except Susan, nodded at that.</p>
<p>"I think that's got to be as bad as it gets," said Parvati. "And
we can handle it. We've proved that now."</p>
<p>Susan couldn't think of anything to say to that. She didn't
think that shrieking at the top of her lungs about blatant
stupidity and DOOM would be persuasive. And she couldn't just
<i>leave</i> the other girls, either. Wasn't it enough to be cursed
with hard work, why did Hufflepuffs have to be <i>loyal</i> on top
of everything else?</p>
<p>"By the way, Lavender," said Padma. "What in the name of
Merlin's underpants were you <i>wearing</i> back there?"</p>
<p>"My hero outfit," said the Gryffindor girl.</p>
<p>Daphne sounded weary, as she spoke without turning her own head
from where she was plodding through the hall. "It's the costume of
the Soldier of Gryffindor from the play <i>Chronicles of the
Lunarian Soldiers</i>."</p>
<p>"Did you Transfigure it?" said Parvati, looking puzzled. "But
the bully cast <i>Finite</i> on you -"</p>
<p>"Nope!" Lavender said. "It's <i>real!</i> See, I just
Transfigured my hero outfit into a regular shirt and skirt
<i>beforehand</i>, so all I had to do was cast <i>Finite</i> on
myself after I saw the bully. Do you want your own, Parvati? I got
mine made yesterday by Katarina and Joshua in sixth-year, for
twelve Sickles -"</p>
<p>"I think," General Granger said in a careful voice, "that would
make us all look a little silly."</p>
<p>"Well," said Lavender, "we should vote on whether to -"</p>
<p>"I think," General Granger said, "that no matter what
<i>anyone</i> votes, I'm not going to be caught <i>dead</i> wearing
one of those costumes -"</p>
<p>Susan ignored the argument. She was trying to think up some sort
of clever strategy for being less doomed.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as
the seven of them walked into lunch.</p>
<p>Then the applause started.</p>
<p>It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone
applauding at once. A lot of it came from the Gryffindor table,
less from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, and none from Slytherin.</p>
<p>Daphne felt her face tightening. She'd <i>hoped</i> - well,
maybe after they found a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin
to rescue, her fellow Slytherins would realize -</p>
<p>She looked at the Hufflepuff table.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high above
his head, although he wasn't smiling. Maybe he'd heard about
Hannah, or maybe he was wondering why Hannah wasn't there.</p>
<p>Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the
Head Table.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout's face was lined with concern. She and
Professor McGonagall were leaning their heads toward Headmaster
Dumbledore, who had a solemn look, and all their lips were moving
quickly. Professor Flitwick looked more resigned than anything
else, and Quirrell, face slack, was taking trembling stabs at his
soup using a spoon gripped in a fist.</p>
<p>Professor Snape was looking directly at -</p>
<p><i>Her?</i></p>
<p>Or - at Hermione Granger, standing next to her?</p>
<p>A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master's face, and he
raised his hands, brought them together once in a motion that was
too slow to be a real clap; and then the Potions Master turned back
to his plate, ignoring the conversations around him.</p>
<p>Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily
turned to walk toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and
Parvati peeled off from their group, heading toward the Hufflepuff
and Gryffindor tables on the other side of the Great Hall.</p>
<p>It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table
where the Slytherin Quidditch team sat.</p>
<p>That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled <i>hard</i>
like she was being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the
gap between where Marcus Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a
sad little splutching sound as Hermione's face ended up in Flint's
plate of steak and mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was
just Daphne herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a
bellow of indignation and his hand yanked Hermione back and threw
her into the Ravenclaw table, and she bounced off a student's back
and collapsed onto the ground -</p>
<p>The quiet spread out in ripples.</p>
<p>Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn't get
all the way to her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was
shaking, and that her face was still covered with mashed potatoes
with scattered pieces of steak.</p>
<p>For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody in
the whole Great Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could,
what happened next.</p>
<p>Then Flint's powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain
that bellowed commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous
rumble, "You ruined my food, girl."</p>
<p>Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione's head - Daphne could
see it trembling - turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch
Captain.</p>
<p>"Apologize to me," said Flint.</p>
<p>Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw
table, and then stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he'd
just thought of something -</p>
<p>Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming
into their hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor
table and at the Hufflepuff table and without thinking Daphne
turned to look at the Head Table and she saw that the Headmaster
was still sitting down, watching, just watching, Dumbledore was
<i>just watching</i> and he had one hand out as though to restrain
Professor McGonagall - in just one second someone would shout a
spell and then it would be too late, <i>why wasn't the Headmaster
doing anything</i> -</p>
<p>And a voice said, "My apologies."</p>
<p>Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absolute
shock.</p>
<p>"<i>Scourgify</i>," said that smooth voice, and the mashed
potatoes vanished from Hermione's face, revealing the Ravenclaw's
surprised expression as Draco Malfoy approached her, sheathed his
wand again, and then knelt to one knee beside her and offered her a
hand.</p>
<p>"Sorry about that, Miss Granger," said Draco Malfoy's polite
voice. "I guess someone thought they were being funny."</p>
<p>Hermione took Draco's hand, and Daphne suddenly realized what
was about to happen -</p>
<p>But Draco Malfoy <i>didn't</i> raise Hermione halfway up and
then drop her.</p>
<p>He just pulled her to her feet.</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking
to either side to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were
staring at him in total shock. "Just remember, being cunning and
ambitious doesn't mean you have to be like that."</p>
<p>And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin
bench and sat down like he hadn't - he hadn't just - <i>he'd
just</i> -</p>
<p>Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw bench
and sat down.</p>
<p>A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down.</p>
<p>"Daphne?" said Tracey. "Are you all right?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco's heart was hammering in his chest so hard he worried it
might explode right out of his chest in a shower of blood, like
that curse Amycus Carrow had used once on a puppy.</p>
<p>Draco's face stayed completely controlled, because he knew (it'd
been drilled into him over and over) that if he showed the
slightest sign of the fear he was feeling, his Housemates would rip
him apart like a swarm of Acromantulas.</p>
<p>There'd been no time to check with Harry Potter, no time to
plot, no time to think, just the instant of realizing that the time
to start rescuing Slytherin's reputation was <i>right then</i>.</p>
<p>From all sides of the long Slytherin table, angry faces stared
at Draco.</p>
<p>But they were outnumbered by the faces that just looked
puzzled.</p>
<p>"All right, I give up," said a sixth-year boy that Draco didn't
recognize, sitting across from him and two places to his right.
"Why did you do that, Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Although his mouth was very dry, Draco didn't swallow. That
would have been a sign of fear. Instead he took a bite of carrots,
which had the most moisture of anything on his plate, and chewed
and swallowed, thinking as rapidly as he could.</p>
<p>"You know," Draco said, making his voice as cutting as he could
- as his heart thumped even harder in his chest, as everyone around
him stopped talking to listen - "there's <i>probably</i> some way
to make Slytherin look even <i>worse</i> than attacking eight
first-year girls from all four Houses who are working together to
stop bullies, but I can't think of <i>how</i>. This way we get the
benefit of what Greengrass is doing."</p>
<p>The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.</p>
<p>"What?" said the sixth-year boy, and "Wait, <i>what</i>
benefit?" said a fifth-year girl sitting to his right.</p>
<p>"It makes Slytherin House look better," said Draco.</p>
<p>The Slytherins around him were giving him quizzical gazes like
he'd just tried to explain algebra.</p>
<p>"Look better to <i>who?</i>" said the sixth-year boy.</p>
<p>"But you just helped a <i>mudblood</i>," said the fifth-year
girl. "How's <i>that s</i>upposed to look good?"</p>
<p>Draco's throat closed up. His brain was experiencing a hideous
malfunction during which it couldn't think of anything to say
except the truth -</p>
<p>Then, "It's probably some kind of tremendously clever scheme
Malfoy's got going," said a fifth-year boy. "You know, like in
<i>The Tragedy of Light</i>, where everything that looks like a
setback is part of the plot. And it ends with Granger's head on a
stick and nobody suspecting that it was him."</p>
<p>"<i>That</i> makes sense," someone said from further down the
table, and there was a lot of nodding.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Do <i>you</i> know what the boss's up to?" Vincent muttered in
an undertone.</p>
<p>Gregory Goyle didn't reply. In his mind he could hear very
clearly his master's voice, saying, <i>I can't believe I believed
every word of that</i>, the day the rumor had started about Salazar
Slytherin showing Potter and Granger where to find bullies.</p>
<p>"Mr. Goyle?" whispered Vincent.</p>
<p>Gregory Goyle's lips shaped the words, <i>Oh no,</i> but no
sound came out.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione had left lunch early that day, for some reason she
hadn't felt hungry. Those few seconds of horrible humiliation had
kept burning through her mind, over and over, the feeling of her
face squishing into the mashed potatoes and then being thrown
through the air and then the Slytherin's boy's voice saying
'Apologize to me'... it might have been the first time in her whole
life that she'd felt like <i>hating</i> someone. The boy who'd
thrown her (Marcus Flint, they'd said his name was) and whoever had
cast the tripping Jinx on her in the first place... she'd felt it,
for one horrible instant she'd wanted to go tell Harry that if he
started getting <i>creative</i> on her behalf, she wouldn't
object.</p>
<p>She hadn't been a minute out of the Great Hall before she'd
heard the sound of running feet behind, and turned to see Daphne
racing toward her.</p>
<p>And listened to what her Sunshine Soldier had to say...</p>
<p>"Don't you <i>understand?</i>" Daphne's voice was barely below
a shriek. "Just because someone's nice to you doesn't mean they're
your friend! He's <i>Draco Malfoy!</i> His father's a Death Eater,
all the parents of all his friends are Death Eaters - Nott, Goyle,
Crabbe, <i>everyone around him</i>, do you get it? They <i>all</i>
despise Muggleborns, they want everyone like you to <i>die</i>,
they think you're good for nothing but being a <i>sacrifice</i> in
horrible Dark rituals! Draco is <i>the next Lord Malfoy</i>, he's
been raised from birth to hate you and he's been raised from birth
to <i>lie!</i>" Daphne's gray-green eyes stared fiercely at her,
demanding assent and understanding.</p>
<p>"He -" Hermione said falteringly. She remembered the rooftop,
the awful jolt as she started to fall, Draco Malfoy's hand grabbing
hers and holding it so hard that she'd had bruises afterward. She'd
had to tell him twice before he finally let her fall. "Maybe Draco
Malfoy isn't like them -"</p>
<p>Daphne's whisper was almost a scream. "If he <i>doesn't</i> end
up doing you ten times as hard as he just helped you, his
<i>life</i> is <i>over</i>, do you understand? I mean Lucius Malfoy
would <i>literally</i> disinherit him! D'you know what the chance
is that he's <i>not</i> up to something?"</p>
<p>"Tiny?" said Hermione in a small voice.</p>
<p>"<i>Zero!</i>" hissed Daphne. "I mean <i>none!</i> I mean
<i>less</i> than zero! I mean the chance is so small that you
couldn't find it with three Magnifying Charms and a Point-Me spell
and - and - and an ancient map and a centaur prophet! Everyone in
Slytherin knows he's plotting to do something to you and doesn't
want to be suspected, I heard someone say he was seen pointing his
wand at you just before you tripped - don't you <i>see?</i> <i>This
is all part of Malfoy's plan!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco sat eating his steak with roasted cauliflower florets and
Ashwinder sauce (it wasn't made from real Ashwinder eggs, it just
tasted like fire), trying not to laugh and trying not to cry.</p>
<p>He'd <i>heard</i> about plausible deniability, but hadn't
realized how much it mattered until he found that Malfoys didn't
have any.</p>
<p>"You want to know my plot?" said Draco. "<i>Here's</i> my plot.
I'm not going to do <i>anything</i> and then the <i>next</i> time
people think I'm plotting something, they won't be sure."</p>
<p>"Huh..." said the fifth-year boy. "I don't think I believe you,
that doesn't sound cunning enough to be really it -"</p>
<p>"That's what he <i>wants</i> you to think," said the fifth-year
girl.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Albus," Minerva said dangerously, "did you <i>plan</i> all
this?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Well, if I <i>did</i> snap my fingers under the table, I
wouldn't just <i>tell</i> you that -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Defense Professor's quavering hand dropped his spoon into
the soup again.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"What do you mean, <i>set you up?</i>" said Millicent. The two
of them were sitting cross-legged on Daphne's bed, having come
there straight from the Great Hall after lunch. "With my Seer's
eyes that stare through Time Itself, I saw you <i>winning</i>."</p>
<p>Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather
narrowed at the moment. "That boy was <i>expecting</i> us."</p>
<p>"Well, yeah!" said Millicent. "Everyone knows you're hunting
bullies!"</p>
<p>"Hannah got hit by a really painful hex," Daphne said. "She had
to visit a healer, Millicent! If we're friends you should've
<i>warned</i> me!"</p>
<p>"Look, Daphne, I <i>told</i> you -" The Slytherin girl paused,
as if trying to remember something, and then said, "I mean, I told
you, what I See <i>has</i> to come to pass. If I try to change it,
if <i>anyone</i> tries to change it, really terrible, awful, no
good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it'll come to pass
<i>anyway</i>. If I See you getting beaten up, I <i>can't</i> tell
you that, because then you'd try to <i>not go</i>, and <i>then</i>
-" Millicent stopped.</p>
<p>"And then?" Daphne said skeptically. "I mean, what happens if we
just don't go?"</p>
<p>"I don't <i>know!</i>" said Millicent. "But it probably makes
being eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party!"</p>
<p>"Look, even I know that's not how prophecies work," Daphne said,
then paused. "At least prophecies don't work like that in plays..."
Admittedly, there were all sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid
a prophecy <i>made</i> it happen, or where, on the other hand,
trying to <i>go along</i> with a prophecy was the only reason why
it happened. But you <i>could</i> make prophecies happen your own
way if you were clever enough; or someone who loved you enough
could take your place; or with enough effort it was possible to
break a prophecy outright... Then again, in plays the Seers never
remembered what they Saw, either...</p>
<p>Millicent must have seen Daphne's hesitation, because the other
girl started looking a little more confident. "Well," Millicent
said sharply, "this isn't a play! Look, I'll tell you if I See it
being a hard battle or an easy one. But that's <i>all</i> I can do,
you understand? And if I say 'hard' you <i>can't</i> not show up!
Or - or -" Millicent's eyes rolled back in her head, and she
intoned hollowly, "<i>Those who try to cheat their destinies will
come to sad and gloomy ends -"</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Professor Sprout shook her head, her face looking tight.</p>
<p>"But -" said Susan. "But you helped <i>Harry Potter</i> that one
time -"</p>
<p>"And it was made <i>quite clear</i> to me," Professor Sprout
said in a voice that sounded like someone was using a Shrinking
Charm to squeeze her throat, "that it was Professor Snape's job,
and not mine, to keep order in Slytherin House - Miss Bones,
<i>please</i>, you don't have to <i>do</i> this if -"</p>
<p>"Yes, I <i>do</i> have to," Susan said unhappily. "I'm a
Hufflepuff, we have to be loyal."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"A mysterious parchment under your pillow?" said Harry Potter,
looking up from where he was sitting, in the Quieted nook where
they were studying. Then the boy's green eyes narrowed. "It wasn't
from Santa Claus, was it?"</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione. "I'm <i>not</i> going to ask, and you're
<i>not</i> going to tell me, and we're <i>both</i> going to pretend
you never said that and I don't know anything about it -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Susan approached the table as soon as the older girl was alone,
glancing around the Hufflepuff common room to make sure nobody was
watching (the way Auntie had taught her to do it, so that it
wouldn't be obvious that she was looking).</p>
<p>"Hey, Susie," said the seventh-year Hufflepuff. "Do you already
need more -"</p>
<p>"Can I please talk to you privately for a bit?" Susan said.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently
considered a promising upstart on the youth dueling circuit, stood
ramrod straight in Professor Snape's office, with his teeth
clenched tight and sweat trickling down his spine.</p>
<p>"I distinctly recall," said the Head of his House in a sardonic
drawl, "that I warned you, and a number of others this very
morning, that there were certain first-year girls who might prove
annoying, if a fighter were <i>incautious</i> and allowed himself
to be <i>taken by surprise</i>."</p>
<p>Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him.</p>
<p>"I -" said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew
how ridiculous it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. "Sir,
they shouldn't have been able to -" One first-year-girl shouldn't
have been able to break his <i>Protego</i>, no matter what sort of
ancient Charm she used - Greengrass must have had <i>help</i> -</p>
<p>But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn't believe
that.</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite agree," murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct with
menace. "They shouldn't have. I begin to wonder if Mr. Malfoy,
whatever his plotting, has a point, Astorga. It cannot be good for
the repute of Slytherin's House if our fighters, rather than
demonstrating their strength, lose to little girls!" Snape's voice
had risen. "It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated
by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House,
Astorga, or I would deduct points from you myself!"</p>
<p>Jaime Astorga's fists clenched at his side, but he couldn't
think of a thing to say.</p>
<p>It was some time before Jaime Astorga was allowed to leave the
presence of his Head of House.</p>
<p>And afterward, only the walls, the floor, and the ceiling saw
Severus Snape's smile.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>That evening Draco was visited by his father's owl, Tanaxu, who
wasn't green but only because there weren't such things as green
owls. The best Father had been able to find was an owl of the
purest silver feathers, with great luminous green eyes, and a beak
as sharp and cruel as any snake's fang. The parchment wrapped
around Tanaxu's leg was short and to the point:</p>
<p><i>What are you doing, my son?</i></p>
<p>The parchment that Draco sent back was equally short, and it
said,</p>
<p><i>I am trying to stop harm done to Slytherin's reputation,
father.</i></p>
<p>In as much time as it took for an owl to fly from Hogwarts to
Malfoy Manor and back again, the family owl bore another message to
Draco, and this one said only:</p>
<p><i>What are you really doing?</i></p>
<p>Draco stared at the parchment he'd unwrapped from the owl's leg.
His hands trembled, as he held up the parchment to the light of his
fireplace. Five words, carved in black ink, shouldn't have been
scarier than death.</p>
<p>There wasn't very much time to think. Father knew exactly how
long it took for a message to go from Malfoy Manor to Hogwarts and
back again; he would know if Draco delayed to compose a careful
lie.</p>
<p>But Draco still waited until his hand stopped trembling, before
he wrote his reply, the only answer he'd thought of that Father
might accept.</p>
<p><i>I am preparing for the next war.</i></p>
<p>Draco wrapped that parchment around the owl's leg and tied it,
and then sent Tanaxu winging out from his room, through the halls
of Hogwarts, into the night.</p>
<p>He waited, but no reply came.</p>

Pt 8</h3>
<p><i>The red jet of fire took Hannah full in the face, flipping
her end-over-heels and smacking her head straight into the stone
wall, where her pale face seemed to linger for an instant, framed
by flying strands of brown-golden hair, before she collapsed to the
ground in a heap of robes, as the third and final volley of blazing
green spirals brought down their foe's Shield Charm.</i></p>
<p>The March days marched by, filled with lectures and study and
homework, breakfast and lunch and dinner.</p>
<p><i>The Gryffindor boy stared at the eight of them, tension in
every line of his body's frame, his face working soundlessly; and
then his hands released their clenched grasp on the Slytherin boy's
lapels, and he walked away without anyone saying a word. (Well,
Lavender almost said a word - her mouth was just opening in
indignation, maybe because she hadn't gotten a chance to declaim
her speech - but luckily Hermione spotted it and made the gesture
that meant SHUT UP.)</i></p>
<p>Then there was sleeping, of course. You wouldn't want to forget
about sleeping just because it seemed so normal.</p>
<p><i>"Innervate!" said the young voice of Susan Bones, and
Hermione's eyes flew open and her lips drew in air with a gasp, her
lungs feeling heavy like there was a huge weight resting on her
chest. Beside her, Hannah was already sitting up, holding her head
in her hands and grimacing. Daphne had warned them that this would
be a 'hard' fight, creating a certain trepidation in Hermione, and
indeed in all of them. Except maybe Susan, who'd just shown up at
the appointed meeting-time, and walked alongside them without
speaking, and fought the seventh-year bully until she was the last
girl standing. Maybe the Gryffindor had been reluctant to fight the
last daughter of Bones, or maybe Susan had just gotten very lucky;
at any rate, when Hermione had tried to sit up again, she'd
realized that her chest had felt heavy because there was, in fact,
a rather large body sprawled on top of her.</i></p>
<p>And you wouldn't want to forget about magic either, even if the
actual moment of casting a spell only formed a very small part of
your day. It was the whole point of Hogwarts, after all.</p>
<p><i>"Okay, how about if we all ride around on skateboards?" said
Lavender. "We could get places faster than walking. And we'd look
really awesome on skateboards, Muggle artifacts may not be as fast
as broomsticks but they look cooler - we should vote on it
-"</i></p>
<p>As for the remaining fractions of time, you would fill that
according to your nature: gossip about upper-year romances, or
books and study sessions.</p>
<p><i>Hermione reached out a trembling hand to grasp her copy
of</i> Hogwarts: A History <i>from where it had fallen, the
ever-comforting book only a pace distant from where she herself had
ended up on the floor, after the red-robed upper-year girl had
"bumped" her into a wall. And then the older Gryffindor witch had
walked away without a look back, only a whispered "Salazar's -" and
a word that hurt her more than anything the Slytherins said about
mudbloods, 'mudblood' was just a strange wizarding word but
Hermione knew the word the Gryffindor had said. She couldn't get
used to it, she just couldn't get used to being hated. It still
hurt just as much every time it happened, and somehow it hurt even
more coming from the Gryffindors who were</i> supposed <i>to be the
good ones.</i></p>
<p>Harry had divided up eight of his soldiers among the other
armies, as ordered; he'd voluntarily given up <i>two</i> Chaotic
Lieutenants, sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army and then trading
Seamus Finnigan to her for Blaise Zabini, who Harry had said was
being "underutilized" in Sunshine. Lavender had elected to join
most of SPHEW in Sunshine; Tracey had decided to stay with
Chaos.</p>
<p><i>"So you can work your charms on General Potter?" said
Lavender, as Hermione ignored both of them as hard as she could.
"I've got to say, Traces, I think our Sunshine General has him
pretty well sewn up by now - you'd have better luck convincing
Hermione that the three of you should have one of those, you know,
arrangements -"</i></p>
<p>Nobody had figured out yet what Draco Malfoy was plotting.</p>
<p><i>"Certain?" said Harry Potter, sounding rather reluctant. "You
know a rationalist isn't ever certain of anything, Hermione, not
even that two and two make four. I can't actually read Malfoy's
mind, and if I could, I couldn't be certain he wasn't a perfect
Occlumens. All I can say is that based on what I've seen of Malfoy,
it's a lot more plausible than Daphne Greengrass thinks, that he
actually is trying to show the Slytherins a better way. We
should... we really should try to go along with that,
Hermione."</i></p>
<p>(Well, Harry seemed to think Draco Malfoy was a good guy. But
then the trouble was that Harry also tended to trust people like
Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "I'm worried about the hatred
Slytherin House seems to be developing for Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>They were sitting in the Defense Professor's office, Harry
sitting far back from the teacher's desk (and the sense of pending
disaster was still noticeable, even then), the empty bookcase still
framing Professor Quirrell's balding head. The cup balanced on
Harry's thigh was filled with Professor Quirrell's obscure,
probably-expensive Chinese tea, and it said something about the way
Harry had been thinking lately that he'd needed to make a conscious
decision to drink it.</p>
<p>"And this concerns me for what reason?" said Professor Quirrell,
sipping his tea.</p>
<p>"Yes, well," said Harry, "I'm just going to ignore that - oh,
stop that, Professor Quirrell, <i>you've</i> been plotting to
restore Slytherin House's reputation since at least the first
Friday of this year."</p>
<p>There might have been a tiny crack of a smile, at the edges of
those thin pale lips; and then again, there might not have been. "I
think Slytherin's House will do well enough in the end, Mr. Potter,
regardless of the fate of one girl. But I do agree that the present
outlook is not favorable for your little friend. The bullies of two
Houses, many of them with powerful and well-connected families, see
Miss Granger as a threat to their reputation and a shame to their
pride. As powerful a motive as that is to hurt her, it pales
compared to the raw envy of the Gryffindors, who see an outsider
gaining the laurels of heroism which they have dreamed of since
childhood." Now the smile on Professor Quirrell's lips was
definite, though slight. "And then there are those of Slytherin
House who hear that Salazar Slytherin's ghost has abandoned them to
favor a mudblood. I wonder if you can even conceive, Mr. Potter, of
how such as they would react? Those who do not believe it would
cheerfully kill Miss Granger for the insult. And as for those
Slytherins who wonder deep down, in some quiet place within
themselves, if it might perhaps be <i>true...</i> their inner panic
is something scarcely to be contemplated." Professor Quirrell
sipped his tea equably. "When you are more experienced, Mr. Potter,
you will see such consequences in advance of your plotting. As it
stands, you are being ill-served by your willful ignorance of all
human nature you deem unpleasant."</p>
<p>Harry sipped his own tea.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Harry. "Professor Quirrell... help?"</p>
<p>"I already offered Miss Granger my help," said Professor
Quirrell, "as soon as I foresaw what would develop. My student told
me, in polite terms, to stay out of her business. Nor would she
tell you anything different, I expect. As I have little to truly
gain or lose in this matter, I hardly intend to press the point."
The Defense Professor shrugged, his teacup held steady in the
exactly-right polite grip, so that the surface of the liquid did
not even ripple as Professor Quirrell leaned back within his chair.
"Do not worry too much, Mr. Potter. Emotions run high around Miss
Granger, but she is in less danger than you might imagine. When you
are older, you will learn that the first and foremost thing which
any ordinary person does is nothing."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The envelope which the Slytherin System had delivered to Daphne
at lunch was unsigned, as always; the parchment within named a time
and a place and said, simply, <i>"Hard."</i></p>
<p>That wasn't what had concerned Daphne. What had concerned Daphne
was that Millicent didn't seem to be looking in her or Tracey's
direction at lunch that day. She'd just stared straight ahead at
her plate and eaten. Millicent had looked up just once that Daphne
saw, in the direction of the Hufflepuff table, and then looked
quickly back down again; though Daphne was too far away to see the
expression on Millicent's face, since Millicent had sat down far
away from her and Tracey.</p>
<p>Daphne had thought about that during lunch, with a sick feeling
in her stomach unlike anything she'd felt before, and which had
caused her to stop eating halfway through her first plate.</p>
<p><i>What I See has to come to pass... it probably makes being
eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party...</i></p>
<p>It wasn't any conscious decision that Daphne made, nothing like
Slytherins were supposed to do, no weighing of the benefits to
herself.</p>
<p>Instead -</p>
<p>Daphne told Hannah and Susan and everyone, that her informant
had warned her that the next bully was going to target Hufflepuffs
in particular, and that the bully planned to risk the teachers'
wrath in order to <i>really</i> hurt either Hannah or Susan, like
<i>seriously</i>, and the two of them needed to stay out of this
one.</p>
<p>Hannah had agreed to stay out of it.</p>
<p>Susan had -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>What are you doing here?</i>" yelled General Granger,
though it was sort of a yell and a whisper at the same time.</p>
<p>Susan's round face didn't change, like the Hufflepuff girl had
suddenly developed the sort of experienced blankness that Daphne's
own Mother used. "Am I here, really?" Susan said calmly.</p>
<p>"<i>You said you wouldn't come!</i>"</p>
<p>"Did I say that?" said Susan. She flipped her wand casually in
one hand, leaning against the stone wall of the corridor where they
were waiting, her reddish-brown hair somehow arranging itself in
perfect order against the yellow trim of her witch's robes. "I
wonder why. Maybe I didn't want Hannah to get any strange ideas.
Hufflepuff loyalty, you know."</p>
<p>"If you don't leave," said the Sunshine General, "I'll call a
mission abort, and we'll <i>all</i> go back to our study halls,
Miss Bones!"</p>
<p>"<i>Hey!</i>" said Lavender. "We didn't vote on -"</p>
<p>"That's fine by me," said Susan, who was keeping a steady gaze
on the other end of the corridor where it merged into the tiled
hallway where they'd been told to expect the bully. "I'll just stay
here myself, then."</p>
<p>"Why -" said Daphne. Her heart was in her throat. <i>If I try to
change it, if</i> anyone <i>tries to change it, really terrible,
awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it'll
come to pass anyway...</i> "Why are you doing this?"</p>
<p>"It's not like me," said Susan. "I know. But -" Susan shrugged.
"People don't always behave like themselves, you know."</p>
<p>They pleaded.</p>
<p>They begged.</p>
<p>Susan didn't even say anything anymore, she just kept watching,
waiting.</p>
<p>Daphne was nearly crying, she kept wondering if she'd
<i>caused</i> this, if trying to change Fate was making this happen
<i>worse</i> -</p>
<p>"Daphne," said Hermione, her voice sounding much higher than
usual, "go get a teacher. Run."</p>
<p>Daphne spun on her heels and started to pelt down the other
direction of the stony corridor, and then she realized, and she
turned back to where all the other girls except Susan were watching
her go, and Daphne, feeling like she was about to throw up, said,
"I can't..."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I think it gets worse every time you try to fight it," said
Daphne. That was how it worked in plays, sometimes.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at her, and then Hermione said, "Padma."</p>
<p>The other Ravenclaw girl just tore right out of there without
arguing. Daphne watched her go, knowing that Padma wasn't as good a
runner as her, and now wondering if maybe that would turn out to be
the <i>only reason</i> why help would come too late...</p>
<p>"Bullies are here," Susan said laconically. "Huh, they've got a
hostage."</p>
<p>They all whirled, and looked, and saw -</p>
<p><i>Three</i> older bullies, Daphne's eyes recognized Reese Belka
who was a top lieutenant in one of the seventh-year armies, and
Randolph Lee who was number two in the Hogwarts dueling club, and
worst of all, Robert Jugson III, in his sixth year, whose father
was almost certainly a Death Eater.</p>
<p>All three were surrounded by Shielding Charms, blue hazes that
glowed beneath the surface in ribbons of other color and showed
occasional faceting above, multi-layered shields like the three of
them thought they were fighting serious duelists and had expended
energy accordingly.</p>
<p>And behind them, bound and supported by glowing ropes, was
Hannah Abbott. Her eyes were wide and panicked and her mouth was
moving, though they couldn't hear anything through the
<i>Quietus</i> they'd put up earlier.</p>
<p>Then Jugson made an offhand gesture with his wand, and the
glowing ropes flung Hannah at them, there was a small pop as
Hannah's body blew through the Quieting barrier, Susan's wand was
instantly pointing at Hannah and Susan's voice muttered
"<i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>" -</p>
<p>"<i>Run!</i>" screamed Hannah, as she was gently lowered to the
ground.</p>
<p>But the corridor behind them and in front of them was now
blocked with a glowing gray field, a barrier spell that Daphne
didn't recognize.</p>
<p>"Do I need to explain what this is about?" Lee said with false
joviality. The seventh-year duelist was sporting a smile that
didn't reach his eyes. "Well, just in case, you little
inconveniences, and that includes you Miss Greengrass, you've been
quite enough trouble and you've told quite enough lies. We brought
your little friend just to make sure everyone knew we got all of
you - though I suppose the other Ravenclaw girl is hiding around a
corner or clinging to the ceiling somewhere? Well, no matter. This
is your -"</p>
<p>"Enough talk," said Robert Jugson III, "time for pain," and
raised his wand. "<i>Cluthe!</i>"</p>
<p>Simultaneously Susan pointed her wand and said
"<i>Prismatis!</i>" and a small rainbow sphere formed in midair
almost instantly, the miniature barrier so condensed and bright
that it stayed intact even as Jugson's hex hit it and bounced off
toward Belka, whose wand flashed to swat away the dark bolt; and
then a moment later the many-colored blaze was gone.</p>
<p>Daphne's eyes went wide for a moment; she'd never thought of
using a Prismatic Sphere like <i>that</i> -</p>
<p>"Jugsy, honey?" said Belka. Her lips widened in a vicious smile.
"I thought we discussed this. First we beat them, <i>then</i> we
play."</p>
<p>"P-please," said Hermione Granger in a faltering voice, "let
them go - I, I, I promise I'll -"</p>
<p>"Oh, really," said Lee in an annoyed tone. "Are you about to
offer to turn yourself over if we let the others go? We've got
<i>all</i> of you, now."</p>
<p>Jugson smiled, then. "It could be funny," said the sixth-year
junior Death Eater, softly and with menace. "How about if you lick
my shoes, mudblood, and <i>one</i> of your friends can go? Pick
whichever one you like best, leave the others to get hurt."</p>
<p>"Nope," said the young voice of Susan Bones, "not going to
happen," and with a blindingly fast motion the Hufflepuff girl
leapt leftward just as a red stunbolt erupted from Belka's wand,
Daphne could hardly <i>see</i> the movement as Susan seemed to hit
the corridor wall and then bounce off it like she was a rubber ball
and her legs smashed into Jugson's <i>face</i>, it didn't go
through the shield but the sixth-year went sprawling backward with
the impact and Susan followed him downward and her foot stamped
down on the boy's wand arm, again being repelled by the shield,
"<i>Elmekia!</i>" shouted Lee and Parvati shouted
"<i>Prismatis!</i>" and the rainbow wall formed but the fiery blue
blast passed right through it like it wasn't even there, the bolt
missed Susan by inches, there was a whirlwind of motion that Daphne
couldn't follow during which Belka had her feet knocked out from
under her, but the older witch just rolled back to a stand and then
-</p>
<p>Daphne saw it coming, and her lips started to mouth
"<i>Pris-</i>" but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Three blasts of brilliance slammed into Susan at once, she had
her wand raised as though she could counter them and there was a
white flash as the hexes struck the magical wood, but then Susan's
legs convulsed and sent her flying into a corridor wall. Her head
hit with a strange cracking sound, and then Susan fell down and lay
motionless with her head at an odd-seeming angle, her wand still
clutched in one outstretched hand.</p>
<p>There was a moment of frozen silence.</p>
<p>Parvati scrambled over to where Susan lay, pressed a thumb over
the pulse point on Susan's wrist, and then - then slowly,
tremblingly, Parvati rose to her feet, her eyes huge -</p>
<p>"<i>Vitalis revelio</i>," said Lee just as Parvati opened her
mouth, and Susan's body was surrounded by a warm red glow. Now the
seventh-year boy really was grinning. "Probably just a broken
collarbone, I'd say. Nice try, though."</p>
<p>"Merlin, they <i>are</i> tricky," said Jugson.</p>
<p>"You had me going for a second there, dearies." The seventh-year
girl wasn't smiling at all.</p>
<p>"<i>Tonare!</i>" screamed Daphne, raising her wand above her
head and focusing harder than she ever had in her life. "<i>Rava
calvaria! Lucis -</i>"</p>
<p>She didn't even see the hex that got her.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione felt the jolt of Innervation bringing her awake, and
out of some intuitive strategism she <i>didn't</i> roll to her feet
right away; it had been a completely hopeless battle and she didn't
know what she could do but some instinct told her that leaping to
her feet wasn't it.</p>
<p>Just a crack, Hermione opened her eyes, and the thin rays of
light that entered them showed Parvati backing away from all three
bullies, the last girl standing that Hermione could see.</p>
<p>And her eyes also showed Tracey fallen not far away from her,
and Hermione's wand was still in her hand; and so, desperately
hoping the Slytherin girl would show more sense than she usually
did, Hermione made the wand movements as subtly as she could, and
hardly moving her lips, whispered, "Innervate."</p>
<p>Hermione felt the spell working, but Tracey didn't move.
Hermione hoped it was because Tracey was being cunning, and waiting
to...</p>
<p>What <i>could</i> they do?</p>
<p>Hermione didn't know, and the panic that had waited through the
moments of fighting was starting to eat her up inside now that she
was still, now that she was trying to think, now that she could see
that it was all absolutely hopeless.</p>
<p>That was when Hermione heard a thud, and though it was out of
her field of vision now, she knew that Parvati had fallen.</p>
<p>A moment of silence came, and passed.</p>
<p>"Now what?" said the voice of the scary-soft boy.</p>
<p>"Now we wake up the mudblood," said the precise voice of the
scary-formal boy, "and find out who's <i>really</i> behind them,
not Salazar Slytherin's ghost."</p>
<p>"No, dears," said the voice of the scary-sweet girl,
"<i>first</i> we bind them all <i>very</i> securely -"</p>
<p>And then there was a sound like lightning and thunder and
Hermione's eyes widened in shock before she could stop herself, and
in her widened field of vision she saw the scary-soft boy
convulsing as yellow arcs of energy crawled over him like giant
blazing worms. His wand flew out of his hand as he collapsed to the
ground, twitching, and then a moment later he lay still.</p>
<p>"Is everyone else asleep now?" said a voice. "Good."</p>
<p>Susan Bones rose from the floor near where the scary-soft boy
had stood, neck still oddly bent. Then she rolled her head around
her shoulders, a casual loose motion, and her head was straight
again.</p>
<p>The round-faced first-year girl stood facing the remaining two
bullies with one hand cocked on her hip.</p>
<p>Grinning.</p>
<p>And surrounded by faceted blue haze.</p>
<p>"Polyjuice!" spat the bully-girl.</p>
<p>"<i>Polyfluis Reverso!</i>" roared the remaining boy bully.</p>
<p>Something like the form of a mirrored scarf spat out of his wand
-</p>
<p>Passed without resistance through the haze surrounding Susan
-</p>
<p>For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a
reflection of herself -</p>
<p>And then the glow faded.</p>
<p>The young girl still stood there, hand on her hip.</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Susan.</p>
<p>"And <i>this</i> is the truth," said Susan. "In case nobody ever
told you -"</p>
<p>In her small hand a wand rose up, blurred by the blue haze
surrounding it.</p>
<p>"You don't mess with the 'Puffs," said Susan, and with a grey
flash so bright it hurt Hermione's half-closed eyes, the real
battle started.</p>
<p>It went on for a while.</p>
<p>Some of the ceiling got melted.</p>
<p>The girl-bully tried to cry a truce, that they would leave and
take Jugson with them, and Susan roared out the syllables of a
curse Hermione recognized as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting which was
illegal in seven countries.</p>
<p>Eventually the girl-bully lay unconscious and unawakenable on
the ground, and the last boy-bully had fled leaving his companions'
bodies behind, and Susan was leaned over against one wall, covered
in sweat and her scorched robes soaked through with wet spots,
gasping for breath, and clutching at her right shoulder using her
left hand.</p>
<p>After a while Susan straightened up, and turned to look back at
where her fellow witches were sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Well, they <i>should've</i> been sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Lavender was already sitting up with eyes as wide as
watermelons.</p>
<p>"That..." said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Was..." said Tracey.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I mean, <i>what?</i>" said Parvati.</p>
<p>"<i>Cool!</i>" said Lavender.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell," said Susan Bones. Her face had already looked a
little pale beneath the sweat, and now it was getting paler,
looking almost frighteningly white. "Ah... could I convince you
that you hallucinated all that?"</p>
<p>There was a rapid exchange of glances. Hermione looked at
Parvati, Parvati looked at Lavender, Lavender briefly locked gazes
with Tracey.</p>
<p>The four of them looked back at Susan and shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Oh, hell," said Susan again. "Look I'll be back in a few
minutes but I've really got to go now <i>please</i> don't say
anything bye!"</p>
<p>And Susan ran out into the hallway, moving surprisingly fast,
before anyone could say another word.</p>
<p>"No, seriously, <i>what?</i>" said Parvati.</p>
<p>"<i>Innervate</i>," said Hermione, pointing her wand at Daphne,
whose body she hadn't been able to see before; and Lavender pointed
her wand at Hannah's body and said the same.</p>
<p>Hannah's eyes opened and she tried frantically to roll to her
feet, but collapsed to the ground halfway through.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Hannah!" said Lavender. "We won."</p>
<p>"We <i>what?</i>" said Hannah from her little heap on the
floor.</p>
<p>Daphne hadn't stirred, but Hermione could see her chest rising
and falling, and the breathing rhythm looked normal enough. "I
think she's okay," said Hermione, "but -" She took a moment to
swallow, her mouth was still dry. This had all gotten way, way,
<i>way</i> out of hand. "I think we ought to take Daphne to Madam
Pomfrey's..."</p>
<p>"Sure, sure, just <i>give me a second here</i> and I'll
<i>probably be fine</i>," said Parvati.</p>
<p>"Ex<i>cuse</i> me," Hannah said in a tone that was polite, but
firm. "How did we win? And why does the ceiling look all
melty?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Susan did it," said Tracey.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Parvati, voice only slightly shaky as she stood up
and started to brush off her red-trimmed robes, "it turns out that
Susan Bones is the Heir of Hufflepuff and she's opened up the
long-lost entrance to Helga Hufflepuff's Chamber of Hard Work and
Practice."</p>
<p>"<i>Huh?</i>" said Hannah, who was feeling over herself as if
to make sure all her body parts were still there. "I thought that
was just something Professor Sprout says to teach us an Important
Moral Lesson - <i>Susan</i> is?"</p>
<p>Slowly, Hermione was beginning to feel a bit more together. It
hadn't really been more than thirty seconds of extreme terror, at
least not the parts she'd been conscious for. "Actually," Hermione
said carefully, as her mind started to work again, "I'm pretty sure
that <i>is</i> just something Professor Sprout says, it wasn't in
<i>Hogwarts: A History</i> or anywhere else I've read -"</p>
<p>"<i>She's a double witch!</i>" shouted Tracey, her voice so
high it cracked. "She <i>is!</i> She's one of <i>them!</i> She's
been this whole time!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" yelled Parvati, twisting around to look at
Tracey. "That is the <i>looniest</i> thing -"</p>
<p>"Of <i>course!</i>" said Lavender, now all the way on her feet
and starting to bounce up and down with excitement. "I should've
<i>realized!</i>"</p>
<p>"Susan's a <i>what?</i>" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"A <i>double</i> witch!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"You see," said Lavender, speaking very rapidly, "There've
always been stories, about these children who are born as super
magicians who can cast spells no one else can, and there's a whole
secret school hidden inside Hogwarts with classes that only they
can see and go to -"</p>
<p>"Those are just <i>stories!</i>" yelled Parvati. "That's not
how real life works! I mean, sure, I read those books too -"</p>
<p>"Just a minute, please," said Hermione. Maybe her mind
<i>was</i> feeling a little slow after all. "You mean even though
you <i>already</i> get to go to a magical school and everything,
you still want to go to a <i>double</i> magical school?"</p>
<p>Lavender looked at her, puzzled. "What?" said Lavender. "Who
<i>wouldn't</i> want to have super extra magical powers? It would
be like this whole amazing <i>destiny</i> and everything! It'd mean
you were <i>special!</i>"</p>
<p>Hannah nodded to that, looking up from where she'd crawled to
Daphne's side and was checking the girl for broken bones. "I wish
<i>I</i> was a double witch," Hannah said, and then, sounding a
little sadder, "though I don't believe there is any such thing,
really... what did you see Susan do, exactly? I mean, are you sure
you weren't just seeing things after getting stunned?"</p>
<p>Hermione truly, truly couldn't find any words at this point.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said Tracey. The Slytherin girl spun around to look at
the entrance to the corridor, her robes fluttering around her. "Oh
no! We've got to get out of here! We've got to get away before
Susan comes back with someone who can Super-Memory-Charm us!"</p>
<p>"Susan wouldn't <i>do</i> that!" said Parvati. "I mean, if there
even <i>was</i> -"</p>
<p>"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" roared a high-pitched squeaky voice, as
Professor Flitwick stormed into the partially melted corridor like
a small, dangerously compressed package of pure academic fury, an
ashen-faced Padma gasping along behind him.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"What <i>happened?</i>" Susan blurted to the girl who looked
exactly like her, except for the scorched robes damp with
sweat.</p>
<p>"Ooh, great question!" said the other Susan Bones as she rapidly
skinned off what was left of her borrowed clothes. A moment later
the girl began to Metamorphose back into her more accustomed form
of Nymphadora Tonks. "Sorry but I couldn't think of anything myself
so you've got about three minutes to decide on an answer to that
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As Daphne Greengrass observed afterward with some acidity, the
flaw in Hermione's cunning plan to make sure that House points were
taken evenly from all four Houses if they got caught, was that it
didn't work on <i>detentions</i>.</p>
<p>They'd all agreed to keep their mouths shut about Susan's
mysterious powers - even Tracey, after Susan threatened to have her
Super-Memory-Charmed if she didn't promise. Unfortunately, they
discovered at dinnertime that someone had forgotten to tell the
<i>bullies</i> about their agreement, and also that Susan Bones had
sacrificed her soul to dreadful forbidden powers which now
inhabited the hulk of her body and that was why they'd all gotten
detention.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Harry Potter said to her from beside her at the
dinner table, his voice very tentative. "Please don't take offense,
and I'll understand if you say it's none of my business, but I
think all this is starting to spin out of control."</p>
<p>Hermione went on mashing the slice of chocolate cake on her
plate into a seamless mush of cake and icing. "Yes," Hermione said,
her voice might have been a little acerbic, "that was what I said
to Professor Flitwick while I was apologizing to him, that I knew
things had gotten out of hand, and he yelled: <i>Really, Miss
Granger? Do you think?</i> in a squeak so loud that my ears caught
on fire. I mean my ears <i>actually caught on fire</i>. Professor
Flitwick had to put them out again."</p>
<p>Harry had put his hand to his forehead. "Excuse me," Harry said.
His face was perfectly straight. "Sometimes I still have a little
trouble getting used to that sort of thing. Hey, Hermione, remember
when we were young and naive and we still thought the world was a
relatively understandable place?"</p>
<p>Hermione put her fork down and looked at him for a moment. "Do
you sometimes wish you were a Muggle, Harry?"</p>
<p>"<i>Huh?</i>" said Harry. "Well, of course not! I mean, even if
I was a Muggle, I'd probably have tried someday to take over the
worrrrlllll-" as Hermione gave him a <i>look</i> and the boy
hastily swallowed the word and said, "I mean <i>optimize</i> of
course, you <i>know</i> that's what I really mean, Hermione! My
point is, it's not like my <i>goals</i> would change one way or
another. But with magic it's going to be a lot easier to get things
done than if I had to do stuff using only the Muggle capability
set. If you think about it logically, that's <i>why</i> I'm going
to Hogwarts instead of just ignoring all this and studying for a
career in nanotechnology."</p>
<p>Hermione, having finished hand-crafting her Chocolate Cake
Sauce, began to dip her carrots in it and eat them.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" said Harry. "Do <i>you</i> wish you were back
in the Muggle world?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly," Hermione said, as she crunched into both the
carrot and the chocolate. "I was just, well, feeling strange about
having <i>wanted</i> to be a witch... Did you want to be a wizard
when you were little?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said promptly. "I also wanted psychic powers
and super-strength and adamantium-reinforced bones and my own
flying castle and sometimes I felt sad that I might have to settle
for just being a famous scientist and an astronaut."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded. "You know," she said softly, "I think the
witches and wizards who <i>grow up</i> here don't really appreciate
magic properly..."</p>
<p>"Well, of course they don't," Harry said, "that's what gives us
our advantage. Isn't that obvious? I mean seriously, that was
bloody obvious to me within five minutes of walking into Diagon
Alley." There was a puzzled look on the boy's face, like he
couldn't understand why she was paying attention to something so
ordinary.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="74">Chapter 74</h2><h3>SA, Escalation of Conflicts, Pt
9</h3>
<p>Harry walked forward a step, then another step, until a sense of
unease began to pervade him, a disquiet in his nerves.</p>
<p>He said nothing, lifted no hand; the pervading sense of unease
would say it for him.</p>
<p>From behind the closed door of the office came a whisper,
carrying through the door as though no door were present.</p>
<p>"It is not my office hours," said that cold whisper, "nor yet
the time of our meeting. I take ten Quirrell points from you, and
be glad it is not more."</p>
<p>Harry stayed calm. Going through Azkaban had recalibrated his
scale of emotional disturbances; and losing a House point, which
had formerly rated five out of ten, now lay somewhere around zero
point three. Harry's voice was likewise level, as he said, "You
made a testable prediction and it was falsified, Professor. I only
wished to note that."</p>
<p>As Harry turned to go, he heard the door opening behind him, and
he swung back around in some surprise.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair, his head
lolling back against its rest, as a parchment floated before him.
Both the Defense Professor's hands rested limply on the desk, as
though nerveless. He might have been a corpse, excepting that the
ice-blue eyes still moved, back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>The parchment vanished, and was replaced by another so quickly
it was like the material had only flickered.</p>
<p>Then the lips moved as well. "And from this," whispered the
lips, "you infer what, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry was shaken by the sight, but his voice stayed even as he
said, "That ordinary people do not always do nothing, and that
Hermione Granger is in more danger from Slytherin House than you
thought."</p>
<p>The lips curved, ever so barely. "So you think I have failed in
my grasp of human nature. But that is hardly the only possibility,
boy. Do you see the other?"</p>
<p>Harry furrowed his brows as he stared at the Defense
Professor.</p>
<p>"I tire of this," the Defense Professor whispered. "You will
stand there until you see it for yourself, or else leave." As
though Harry had stopped existing, the Defense Professor's eyes
looked back to the parchment, once more scanning back and
forth.</p>
<p>It was six parchments later that Harry saw it, and said out
loud, "You think your prediction failed because there was some
other factor at work which was not in your model. Some reason why
Slytherin House hates Hermione more than you realized. Like when
the orbital calculations for Uranus were wrong, and the problem
wasn't in Newton's Laws, it was that they didn't know about Neptune
-"</p>
<p>The parchment vanished, and was not replaced. The head rose from
its lolling position then, facing Harry more directly, and the
voice which issued forth was quiet, but not toneless. "I think,
boy," Professor Quirrell said softly, but in something approaching
his normal voice, "that if all Slytherin House hated her so much, I
would have seen it. And yet three formidable fighters of that House
did something rather than nothing, at risk and at cost to
themselves. What force could have moved them, or willed their
motion?" The icy blue glitter of the Defense Professor's eyes met
Harry's own gaze. "Some hand possessed of influence within
Slytherin, perhaps. Then how would that hand have benefited itself
by harm done to the girl and her followers?"</p>
<p>"Um..." said Harry. "It would have to be someone threatened by
Hermione somehow, or someone who would get the credit if she was
hurt? I don't know anyone who fits that profile, but then I don't
know much about anyone in Slytherin outside first-year." The
thought was also coming to Harry that deducing a hidden mastermind
from a single mildly-unexpected attack seemed like insufficient
evidence to support the prior improbability of the theory; but then
it <i>was</i> Professor Quirrell who was doing the deducing...</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was just looking at Harry, eyelids
slightly lowered as though in impatience.</p>
<p>"And yes," said Harry, "I <i>am</i> sure that Draco Malfoy isn't
behind it."</p>
<p>A hiss of outward air like a sigh. "He is the son of Lucius
Malfoy, trained to the most exacting standards. Whatever you have
seen of him, even in what seem to be unguarded moments when his
mask slips and you trust that you have seen the truth beneath, even
that may all be part of the face he chooses to show you."</p>
<p><i>Only if Draco successfully cast the Patronus Charm as part of
keeping up the act.</i> But Harry didn't say that, of course;
instead he just grinned slightly, and said, "So either you've
<i>really</i> never read Draco's mind, or that's just what you want
me to think."</p>
<p>There was a pause. One of the hands turned over, beckoned a
finger.</p>
<p>Harry stepped into the room. The door closed behind him.</p>
<p>"That was not something you should have said aloud in human
speech," said Professor Quirrell's soft voice. "Legilimency, on
Malfoy's heir? Did Lucius Malfoy learn of it, he would have me
assassinated outright."</p>
<p>"He would <i>try</i>," Harry said. It should have won a crinkle
of Professor Quirrell's eyes, but the Defense Professor's face was
unmoving. "But sorry."</p>
<p>When the Defense Professor spoke again, his voice had once more
become a cold whisper. "I suppose I could, and pity the assassin."
His head fell back against the chair, lolled to one side, the eyes
no longer meeting Harry's. "But these small games hardly hold my
interest as they stand. Add Legilimency, and it ceases to be a game
at all."</p>
<p>Harry hardly knew what to say. He'd seen Professor Quirrell in
an angry mood once or twice before, but this seemed emptier, and
Harry didn't know what to say to it. <i>What's bothering you,
Professor Quirrell?</i> he could not ask<i>.</i></p>
<p>"What <i>does</i> hold your interest?" Harry said a few moments
later, after he'd worked it out as a safer-seeming strategy for
redirecting Professor Quirrell's attention to positive things.
Citing experimental results about keeping a gratitude journal as a
strategy for improving life happiness didn't seem like it would be
taken well.</p>
<p>"I will tell you what does not hold my interest," said that icy
whisper. "Grading Ministry-mandated essays does not hold my
interest, Mr. Potter. But I have undertaken the position of Defense
Professor at Hogwarts, and I will see it through to its end."
Another parchment appeared in front of Professor Quirrell's head,
and his eyes began to scan it. "Reese Belka held a high position in
my armies before her folly. I will offer her the chance to stay
rather than being expelled, if she tells me exactly of the forces
which moved her. And I shall make clear to her what will happen if
she lies. I do permit myself to read faces."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's finger pointed past Harry, toward the
door.</p>
<p>"But whether you were wrong about human nature," Harry said, "or
whether there's some extra force at work in Slytherin House -
either way, Hermione Granger is in more danger than you predicted.
Last time it was three strong fighters, so what happens after
-"</p>
<p>"She wishes not my help, nor yours," said a soft cold voice. "I
no longer find your concerns so entertaining as I once did, Mr.
Potter. Go."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Somehow, even though they were all equals and she definitely
wasn't in charge, it was always Hermione who ended up speaking
first in this sort of situation.</p>
<p>The four tables of Hogwarts, the four Houses having breakfast,
were glancing over at where they, the eight members of S.P.H.E.W.,
had gathered off to one side.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick was also staring sternly at all of them from
the Head Table. Hermione wasn't looking there, but she could feel
Professor Flitwick's gaze on the back of her neck. <i>Literally</i>
feel it. It was really creepy.</p>
<p>"Why'd you tell Tracey you wanted to talk to us, Mr. Potter?"
said Hermione, her tone crisp.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell expelled Reese Belka from her army last
night," Harry Potter said. "And from all her other after-school
Defense activities. Do any of you see the significance of that?
Miss Greengrass? Padma?"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes swept over them, as Hermione exchanged a puzzled
glance with Padma, and Daphne shook her head.</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said quietly, "I wouldn't actually expect you to.
But what it means is that you're in danger, and I don't know how
much danger." The boy squared his shoulders, looking straight into
Hermione's eyes. "I wasn't going to say this, but... I just wanted
to offer to put you under whatever protection I could give. Make it
clear to everyone that anyone who messes with you, is messing with
the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>"Harry!" said Hermione sharply. "You <i>know</i> I don't want
-"</p>
<p>"Some of them are <i>my</i> friends too, Hermione." Harry didn't
take his eyes from hers. "And it's their decision, not yours.
Padma? You told me that I owed you no debt for what I did, and
that's the sort of thing a friend would say."</p>
<p>Hermione broke her gaze from Harry, to look at where Padma was
shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Lavender?" Harry said. "You fought well in my army, and I'll
fight for you if you wish it."</p>
<p>"Thank <i>you</i>, General!" Lavender said crisply. "I mean Mr.
Potter. No, though. I'm a heroine and a Gryffindor, and I can fight
for myself."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Parvati?" Harry said. "Susan? Hannah? Daphne? I don't know any
of you so well, but it's something I would offer anyone who came to
ask it of me, I think."</p>
<p>One by one, the other four girls shook their heads.</p>
<p>Hermione realized what was coming, then, but she didn't see a
single thing she could do about it.</p>
<p>"And my loyal soldier, Chaotic Tracey?" said Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"<i>Really?</i>" gasped Tracey, oblivious to the stabbing
glares that Hermione and every other girl were directing at her.
Tracey's hands flew artfully to her cheeks, though she didn't
actually manage to blush, not that Hermione could see; and her
brown eyes were, if not shining, at least opened very wide. "You'd
do that? For <i>me?</i> I mean - I mean, of course, absolutely,
General Chaos -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>And so it was on that very morning that Harry Potter went over
to the Gryffindor table, and then the Slytherin table, and told
both Houses that anyone who hurt Tracey Davis, regardless of what
she was doing at the time, would, quote, learn the true meaning of
Chaos, unquote.</p>
<p>It was with considerable restraint that Draco Malfoy managed to
prevent himself from slamming his head repeatedly into his plate of
toast.</p>
<p>They weren't exactly scientists, the bullies of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>But even <i>they</i>, Draco knew, were going to want to test
it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches
hadn't <i>announced</i> it, it didn't seem like it would do any
good to <i>announce</i> it. But they had all quietly decided (or,
in the case of Lavender, been shouted into it by all seven other
girls) to take a break from fighting bullies for a while, at least
until their Heads of House weren't looking at them quite so sharply
anymore, and older students had stopped bumping Hermione into
walls.</p>
<p>Daphne had <i>told</i> Millicent that they were taking a
break.</p>
<p>And so it was with some puzzlement, a few days later, that
Daphne looked at the parchment delivered to her at lunch, drawn in
a hand so shaky it was almost unreadable, saying:</p>
<p><i>2 this afternoon at the top of the stairs going up from the
library REALLY IMPORTANT everyone has to be there -
Millicent</i></p>
<p>Daphne looked around, but she couldn't see Millicent anywhere in
the Great Hall.</p>
<p>"A message from your informant?" said Hermione, when Daphne told
her. "That's odd - <i>I</i> didn't -"</p>
<p>"You didn't what?" said Daphne, after the Ravenclaw girl had
stopped in mid-sentence.</p>
<p>The Sunshine General shook her head and said, "Listen, Daphne, I
think we need to know where these messages come from before we keep
following them. Look at what happened last time, how could anyone
have <i>known</i> where those three bullies would be, unless they
were in on it?"</p>
<p>"I can't say -" Daphne said. "I mean, I can't say anything, but
I know where the messages come from, and I know how anyone can
know."</p>
<p>Hermione gave Daphne a <i>look</i> that, for a moment, made the
Ravenclaw girl look scarily like Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Uh huh," said Hermione. "And do you know how Susan suddenly
turned into Supergirl?"</p>
<p>Daphne shook her head, and said, "No, but I think it might be
<i>really important</i> that if we get a message saying we should
be somewhere, <i>everyone has to be there</i>." Daphne hadn't
<i>seen</i> what had happened with Susan, after Daphne had tried to
avert the prophecy by keeping Susan away. But she'd been
<i>told</i> about it afterward, and now Daphne was afraid
that...</p>
<p>She might have possibly...</p>
<p>Might possibly have Broken Something...</p>
<p>"Uh huh," said Hermione, who was doing the McGonagall Stare
again.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Nobody seemed to know where it had started, who had started it.
If you'd tried tracing it afterward, tracked it back word by word
and mutter by mutter, you probably would have found it all going in
a huge circle.</p>
<p>Peregrine Derrick was tapped on his shoulder as he left Potions
that morning.</p>
<p>Jaime Astorga heard a whisper in his ear at lunch.</p>
<p>Robert Jugson III discovered a tiny folded note under his
plate.</p>
<p>Carl Sloper overheard two older Gryffindors whispering about it,
and they gave him significant glances as they walked past.</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to know where the word began, or who had first
spoken it, but it named the place, and it named the time, and it
said that the color would be white.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Every single one of you had better be absolutely clear on
this," said Susan Bones. The Hufflepuff girl, or whatever strange
power had possessed her, wasn't even <i>pretending</i> to act
normal anymore. The round-faced girl was striding through the halls
with a firm, confident gait. "If we get there and it's just one
bully, that's fine, you can fight them the regular way. My
mysterious superpowers won't activate if there are no innocents in
danger. But if five seventh-year bullies jump out of a closet, you
know what you do? That's right, you <i>run away</i> and let me
fight them. Finding a teacher is optional, the important thing is
that you <i>run away</i> as soon as I create an opening. In a fight
like that you are <i>liabilities</i>. You are <i>civilian
targets</i> I have to worry about protecting. So you will get away
as fast as possible and you <i>will not try</i> to do
<i>anything</i> heroic or so help me, the hour you get out of your
healer's beds I will <i>personally</i> show up and <i>kick your
asses</i> right back in. Are we all clear on that?"</p>
<p>"Yes," squeaked most of the girls, though in Hannah's case it
came out, "Yes, Lady Susan!"</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> call me that," snapped Susan. "And <i>I don't
think I heard you, Miss Brown!</i> I'm warning you, I have friends
who write plays and if you do anything dumb, posterity will
remember you as Lavender, the Amazing Stupid Hostage."</p>
<p>(Hermione was beginning to worry about just how many other
Hogwarts students besides Harry had mysterious dark sides, and
whether <i>she</i> was likely to develop one if she kept hanging
out with them.)</p>
<p>"Alright, Captain Bones," said Lavender in an unusually
respectful tone, as they turned another corner along the shortest
way to the library, passing through a rather large corridor studded
with six sets of double doors, three sets on either side. "Can I
ask if there's any way for <i>me</i> to become a double witch?"</p>
<p>"Sign up for the Auror preparation program in your sixth year,"
said Susan. "It's the next best thing. Oh, and if a famous Auror
offers to oversee your summer internship, just ignore anyone who
warns you that he's a terrible influence or that you're almost
certainly going to die."</p>
<p>Lavender was nodding rapidly. "Got it, got it."</p>
<p>(Padma, who hadn't actually been there last time, was giving
Susan <i>very</i> skeptical looks.)</p>
<p>Then Susan suddenly stopped in place and her wand snapped up and
she said, "<i>Protego Maximus!</i>"</p>
<p>A jolt of adrenaline went through Hermione, she was instantly
drawing her wand and spinning around -</p>
<p>But she couldn't see anything wrong, through the greater blue
haze now surrounding them all.</p>
<p>The other girls, who had likewise pulled into formation, were
also looking puzzled.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" said Susan. "Sorry, girls. Give me a moment to check
this place out. Thinking of a certain person has just reminded me
that this hall we're in right now, with all those doors, would be
an <i>excellent</i> place for an ambush."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Now," said a harsh male voice, blurred into unidentifiability
by a buzzing undertone.</p>
<p>All six sets of double doors slammed open.</p>
<p>White robes filed silently forward, all-concealing white robes
without marks of House affiliation and white cloth hiding the faces
beneath the hoods. They marched out, and marched out, crowding the
great corridor in numbers too high to count easily. Less than fifty
robes, probably. Certainly more than thirty. All of them already
surrounded by blue haze.</p>
<p>Susan said some Extremely Bad Words, so awful that at almost any
other time, Hermione would have noticed.</p>
<p>"That message!" Daphne cried in sudden horror. "It <i>wasn't</i>
from -"</p>
<p>"Millicent Bulstrode?" said the voice and its buzzing undertone.
"No, it wasn't. You see, Miss Greengrass, if the same girl sends
off a Slytherin message every day you fight a bully, pretty soon
someone else will notice. We'll have a talk with her after we're
done with you."</p>
<p>"Miss Susan," said Hannah in a voice just starting to quaver,
"can you be super enough to -"</p>
<p>Wands rose in many hands. There came a series of blinding
flashes of green light, a massive volley of shieldbreakers, at the
end of which there was no more protective blue dome surrounding
them, and Susan had fallen to her knees, clutching her head.</p>
<p>Barriers of solid blackness had sprung into being at both ends
of the corridor. Behind the double doors that Hermione could see
into, there were only unused classrooms, very dead ends.</p>
<p>"No," said the male voice with that buzz overlaid, "she can't.
In case you haven't noticed, you've gotten quite a lot of people
very angry at you and we have no intention of losing this time. All
right everyone, prepare to fire."</p>
<p>The wands around the perimeter aimed again, low enough that
their enemies wouldn't hit each other if they missed.</p>
<p>And then another male voice, with a similar buzz accompanying
it, suddenly said "<i>Homenum Revelio!</i>"</p>
<p>An instant later there was another massive volley of
shieldbreakers and hexes, fired on reflex at the suddenly revealed
figure, shattering the shields which had almost immediately begun
to form around it -</p>
<p>And then, as that same figure fell to the ground, a stunned
silence.</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Snape?</i>" said the second voice. "<i>He's</i>
the one who's been interfering?"</p>
<p>It was the Potions Master of Hogwarts who now lay unconscious on
the stone floor, the dirt-spotted robes stirring for a final moment
before they settled in place, his fallen hand outstretched toward
where his wand was slowly rolling away.</p>
<p>"No," said the first male voice, now sounding a bit more
uncertain. Then it rallied, "No, that can't possibly be it. He
heard us passing the word, of course, and came along to make sure
nobody screwed it up again. We'll wake him up afterward and
apologize and he'll Memory-Charm the children so they don't
remember, he's a Professor so he can do that. Anyway, we should
make sure we're <i>really</i> alone now. <i>Veritas
Oculum!</i>"</p>
<p>Fully two dozen different Charms must have been spoken, then,
but no more invisible people showed up. One of them in particular
made Hermione's heart sink; she recognized it as the Charm which
had been listed alongside the description of the True Cloak of
Invisibility, which would not reveal the Cloak, but would tell you
whether it or certain other artifacts were nearby.</p>
<p>"Girls?" whispered Susan. She was slowly pushing herself to her
feet, though Hermione could see her limbs swaying and quivering.
"Girls, I'm sorry for what I said before. If you've got anything
clever and heroic to try, you might as well try it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Tracey Davis said then, her voice trembling. "I
almost <i>forgot</i>." The Slytherin girl raised her voice, and
spoke.</p>
<p>"Hey, all of you!" yelled Tracey in a high-pitched shaky shout.
"Hey, are you planning to hurt me too?"</p>
<p>"Yes, actually," said the buzzing voice of the leader. "We
are."</p>
<p>"I'm under Harry Potter's protection, you know! Anyone who tries
to hurt me will learn the true meaning of Chaos! So are you going
to let me go?" It should have sounded defiant. It came out sounding
terrified.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Some of the hoods of the robes turned to face
each other, then turned back to face the girls.</p>
<p>"Hm..." said the buzzing male voice. "Hm... no."</p>
<p>Tracey Davis put her wand away into her robes.</p>
<p>Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand high in the air,
and pressed her thumb and forefingers together.</p>
<p>"Go ahead," said that voice.</p>
<p>Tracey Davis snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>There was a long, awful pause.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>"Yes, well," said the voice -</p>
<p>Tracey said, her voice sounding even higher and shakier,
"<i>Acathla, mundatus sum</i>." Her hand, stretching up still
further, snapped its fingers a second time.</p>
<p>A nameless chill went down Hermione's spine then, a frisson of
fear and disorientation like she'd just felt the floor tilt beneath
her, threatening to spill her into some darkness lying beneath.</p>
<p>"What's she -" began a buzzing female voice.</p>
<p>Tracey's face looked pale, twisted with fear, but her lips
moved, spilled forth sound in a high chant, "<i>Mabra, brahoring,
mabra...</i>"</p>
<p>A chill wind seemed to spring up within the confines of the
corridor, a dark breath that caressed their faces and touched their
hands with ice.</p>
<p>"Fire at her on my count!" shouted the leading voice. "One,
two<i>, three!</i>" and maybe-forty voices roared spells, creating
a huge concentric array of fiery bolts that lit the wide corridor
brighter than the Sun -</p>
<p>- for the short moment before the bolts struck and vanished upon
a dark red octagon that appeared in the air around the girls, and
then disappeared a moment later.</p>
<p>Hermione saw it, she saw it but she still couldn't imagine it;
she couldn't imagine a Shielding Charm that powerful, a spell that
would withstand an army.</p>
<p>And Tracey's voice went on chanting, her voice sounding louder
and more confident, and her face screwed up like she was trying to
remember something <i>very exactly</i>.</p>
<p><i>"Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff.<br />
Fista, wista, mista-cuff."</i></p>
<p>Now all those present could feel it, heroines and bullies alike,
the sensation of some dark will pressing down on them, a tingling
in the air as something built and built and built. All the blue
hazes around the white robes, all the shielding spells, had died
out without any visible hex touching them. There were more flashes
of light as more desperate spells were fired, but they fizzled out
in midair like candle-flames touching water.</p>
<p>The black barriers at the two ends of the corridor had
dissipated like smoke beneath the growing pressure, but their
evaporation revealed the exits sealed, blocked by tiled slats of
dark metal that looked stained as though with blood; and as Tracey
chanted "<i>Lemarchand, Lament, Lemarchand</i>," a dreadful blue
light began to shine out from beneath the metal slats and between
them; and the six sets of double doors slammed shut all at once, as
panicked white-robed bullies began to pound on them and howl.</p>
<p>Then Tracey's hand slashed to her left, and she cried
"<i>Khornath!</i>", then her hand pointed below her and
"<i>Slaaneth!</i>", above her "<i>Nurgolth!</i>", and then, to
her right, "<i>TZINTCHI!</i>"</p>
<p>Tracey paused, took a deep breath; and Hermione found her voice
and cried, "<i>Stop! Tracey, stop!</i>"</p>
<p>But there was a strange wild smile on Tracey's face. She raised
her hand still higher, and snapped her fingers a third time; and
when she spoke again, beneath her high girlish voice there was an
undertone as though some lower chorus were chanting along with
her.</p>
<p><i>"Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black.<br />
Buried beneath the flow of time...<br />
From darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the
emptiness,<br />
Unknown to death, nor known to life."<br /></i></p>
<p>"<i>What are you doing?</i>" shrieked Parvati, and the
Gryffindor girl stretched out a hand as though to pull down the
Slytherin, who was now starting to float upward into the air; and
both Daphne and Susan grabbed Parvati's arm at the same time and
Daphne cried out, "Don't, we don't know what will happen if the
ritual is interrupted!"</p>
<p>"<i>Well what happens if it gets COMPLETED?</i>" screamed
Hermione, as close as she'd ever come to total brain meltdown.</p>
<p>Susan's face was white as chalk, and she whispered, "I'm sorry,
Mad-Eye..."</p>
<p>And Tracey spoke on, her body floating higher and higher off the
floor, her black hair whipping wildly around her in the chill
winds.</p>
<p><i>"You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and
guardian of the gate:<br />
I bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before
me!"</i></p>
<p>The corridor was plunged then into utter darkness and silence,
so that only Tracey could be seen and heard, like there was nothing
left in the universe except her and the light illuminating her from
some nameless source.</p>
<p>The shining girl raised her hand one final time, and with
dreadful gravity, pressed her thumb and forefinger together.</p>
<p>And within the darkness Hermione looked at Tracey's face and saw
that the Slytherin girl's eyes were now, to the exact shade, the
green of Harry Potter's.</p>
<p><i>"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!<br />
Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!<br />
HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES!"</i></p>
<p>There was a snap like thunder, and then -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry had chosen to assume a rather relaxed posture, as he sat
in a low chair before the mighty desk of the Headmaster of
Hogwarts: one leg cocked over his knee, and his arms sprawling
casually to either side. Harry was doing his best to disregard the
noise from the surrounding devices, although the one directly
behind him that sounded like an owl hooting desperately as it was
put through a woodchipper was pretty difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>"Harry," the old wizard said from behind the desk, the aged
voice level as the blue eyes stared out at him from beneath the
shining half-moon spectacles. Headmaster Dumbledore had garbed
himself in robes of midnight purple; not true formal black, but
dark enough to come close indeed to deadly seriousness, as the
wizarding world counted the meaning of fashions. "Were you...
<i>responsible</i> for this?"</p>
<p>"I cannot deny that my influence was at work," Harry said.</p>
<p>The old wizard took off his glasses, leaned forward to stare at
Harry directly, blue eyes to green. "I will ask you one question,"
the Headmaster said in a quiet voice. "Do you think that what you
did today was - <i>appropriate?</i>"</p>
<p>"They were bullies and they came to that hallway with the direct
intent of hurting Hermione Granger and seven other first-year
children," Harry said levelly. "If I am not too young for moral
judgment, then neither are they. No, Headmaster, they didn't
deserve to die. But they <i>did</i> deserve to be stripped naked
and glued to the ceiling."</p>
<p>The old wizard put his glasses back on. For the first time that
Harry had seen of him, the Headmaster seemed to be at a loss for
words. "As Merlin himself is my witness," said Dumbledore, "I
haven't the faintest notion of how I ought to react to this."</p>
<p>"That's pretty much the effect I was aiming for," said Harry. He
felt like he ought to be whistling a merry tune, but unfortunately
he had never learned how to whistle reliably.</p>
<p>"I need not ask you who is <i>directly</i> responsible," said
the Headmaster. "Only three wizards within Hogwarts might be
powerful enough. I myself did not do it. Severus has assured me he
was not involved. And the third..." The Headmaster shook his head
in some dismay. "You loaned the Defense Professor your Cloak,
Harry. I do not think that was wise. For now that he has escaped
detection by simple Charms, he surely knows that it is a Deathly
Hallow - if, indeed, he did not know from its first touch upon his
flesh."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell had already deduced my possession of an
invisibility cloak," Harry said. "And knowing him, he has probably
guessed that it is a Deathly Hallow. But in <i>this</i> case,
Headmaster, it so happens that Professor Quirrell was under one of
those face-concealing white robes."</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>"How very cunning," said the Headmaster. He leaned back in his
throne and sighed. "I have spoken to the Defense Professor. Just
before you, indeed. I did not quite know what to say. I told him
that this was not the approved Hogwarts policy for dealing with
infractions of hallway discipline, and that I did not feel it was
appropriate for a Hogwarts professor to do what he had done."</p>
<p>"And what did Professor Quirrell say to that?" said Harry, who
was not impressed with Hogwarts's current policies for enforcing
hallway discipline.</p>
<p>The Headmaster wore a look of resignation. "He said: <i>Fire
me</i>."</p>
<p>Somehow Harry managed not to cheer out loud.</p>
<p>The Headmaster frowned. "But <i>why</i> did he do it,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"Because Professor Quirrell doesn't like school bullies and I
asked very politely," said Harry. <i>And he was feeling bored and I
thought this might cheer him up.</i> "Either that or it's part of
some incredibly deep plot."</p>
<p>The Headmaster rose up from behind the desk, began to pace back
and forth before the hatstand that held the Sorting Hat and the red
slippers. "Harry, do you not feel that all of this has gotten a
bit..."</p>
<p>"Awesome?" offered Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>Utterly and completely out of hand</i> would say it better,"
said Dumbledore. "I am not sure there has ever been a time in the
whole history of this school when things have become so, so... I
don't have a word for this, Harry, because things have never become
like this before, and so no one has ever needed to invent a word
for it."</p>
<p>Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply
complimented he felt, if he hadn't been snerkling too hard to
speak.</p>
<p>The Headmaster was regarding him with increasing graveness.
"Harry, do you understand <i>at all</i> why I find these events
concerning?"</p>
<p>"Honestly?" said Harry. "No, not really. I mean, of course
Professor McGonagall would object to anything that breaks up the
dull monotony of the Hogwarts school experience. But then Professor
McGonagall wouldn't set a chicken on fire."</p>
<p>The frown lines deepened on Dumbledore's wrinkled face. "That,
Harry, is not what disturbs me," the Headmaster said quietly.
"There was a full battle fought in these halls!"</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, trying to keep his voice carefully
respectful, "Professor Quirrell and I did not choose for that
battle to happen. The bullies did that. <i>We</i> just decided to
have the Light side win. I know there are times where the
boundaries of morality are uncertain, but in this case the line
separating the villains and the heroines was twenty meters tall and
drawn in white fire. Our intervention may have been <i>weird</i>,
but it certainly wasn't <i>wrong</i> -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore had gone back to his desk, sat down in his padded
throne with a dull thump, and was now covering his face with both
his hands.</p>
<p>"Am I missing something here?" Harry said. "I thought you'd be
secretly on our side, Headmaster. It was the Gryffindor thing to
do. The Weasley twins would approve, <i>Fawkes</i> would approve -"
Harry glanced at the golden perch, but it was empty; either the
phoenix had more important things to do, or the Headmaster hadn't
invited him to today's meeting.</p>
<p>"That," said the Headmaster in an old and tired and somewhat
muffled voice, "is precisely the problem, Harry. There is a reason
why courageous young heroes are not put in charge of schools."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. He couldn't quite keep the skepticism
out of his voice. "What am I missing this time?"</p>
<p>The old wizard lifted his head, his face now solemn, and calmer.
"Listen, Harry," said Dumbledore, "hear me well; for all who wield
power must learn this in time. Some things in this world are,
indeed, truly simple. If you pick up a stone and drop it again, the
earth will be no heavier for it, the stars will not move from their
paths. I say this, Harry, so that you know I am not pretending to
be wise, when I tell you that even as some things are simple,
others are complex. There are greater wizardries which leave marks
upon the world, and marks upon those who wield them, as a simple
Charm would <i>not</i>. Those wizardries demand hesitation,
consideration of consequence, a moment to weigh the meaning of
their marks. And yet the most intricate magics known to me are
simpler than the simplest soul. <i>People</i>, Harry, people are
always marked, by what they do and by what is done to them. Do you,
then, understand how to say, 'Here is the line between hero and
villain!' is not enough to say that what you did was right?"</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said evenly, "this is not a decision I made
at random. No, I don't know what exact effect this will have on
every single one of the bullies present. But if I always waited for
perfect information before I acted, I would never do anything. When
it comes to the future psychological development of, say, Peregrine
Derrick, beating up eight first-year girls probably wouldn't have
been good for him. And it wasn't enough to just stop them quietly
and quickly, since then they would just try again later; they had
to see that there was a protective power worth fearing." Harry's
voice stayed level. "But of course, since I <i>am</i> a good guy, I
didn't want to permanently injure them or even cause them any pain;
and yet the penalty had to be enough to weigh on the minds of
anyone thinking about trying it again. So, after weighing the
expected outcomes as best I could with my boundedly rational
intellect, I thought it would be wisest to strip the bullies naked
and glue them to the ceiling."</p>
<p>The young hero stared directly into the old wizard's gaze,
unflinching green eyes locked with the blue behind the
spectacles.</p>
<p><i>And since I wasn't there and didn't do anything personally,
there's no lawful way to punish me under the Hogwarts school rules;
the only one who acted was Professor Quirrell, and he's fireproof.
And just breaking the rules to get at me wouldn't be a wise thing
to do to the hero you're grooming to fight Lord Voldemort...</i>
This time Harry actually <i>had</i> tried to think through all the
ramifications in advance, before he'd made the suggestion to
Professor Quirrell; and for once the Defense Professor hadn't
called him a fool, just slowly smiled and then begun to laugh.</p>
<p>"I understand your intentions, Harry," the old wizard said. "You
think you have taught the bullies of Hogwarts a lesson. But if
Peregrine Derrick could learn that lesson, he would not be
Peregrine Derrick. He will only be provoked more by what you do -
it is not fair, it is not right, but that is the way it is." The
old wizard closed his eyes, as though in brief pain, and then
opened them again. "Harry, the most painful truth any hero must
learn is that the right cannot, should not, must not win every
battle. All of this began when Miss Granger fought three older
enemies and won. If she had been content with this, the echoes of
her deed would have died away in time. Yet instead she banded
together with her classmates and raised her wand in open challenge
to Peregrine Derrick and all his kind; and his kind cannot but
raise their own wands in answer. So Jaime Astorga went hunting her,
and in the natural course he would have beaten her; it would have
been a sad day, but it would have ended there. There is not enough
magic in eight first-year witches all together to defeat such a
foe. But you could not accept that, Harry, could not let Miss
Granger learn her own lessons; and so you sent the Defense
Professor to watch over them invisibly, and pierce Astorga's
shields when Daphne Greengrass struck at him -"</p>
<p><i>What?</i> thought Harry.</p>
<p>The old wizard went on speaking. "Each time you intervened,
Harry, it escalated matters further and yet further. Soon Miss
Granger was facing Robert Jugson himself, the son of a Death Eater,
with two strong allies at his side. Painful indeed it would have
been for her, if Miss Granger had lost that battle. And yet again
by your will and Quirinus's hand, this time shown more openly, she
won."</p>
<p>Harry was still struggling with the notion of the Defense
Professor watching invisibly over S.P.H.E.W., guarding the heroines
from harm.</p>
<p>"And so," the old wizard finished, "that is how we came to
today, Harry, to forty-four students attacking eight first-year
witches. A full battle in these halls! I know it was not your
intent, but you must accept some measure of responsibility. Such
things did not happen before you came to this school, not through
all my decades in Hogwarts; neither when I was a student nor when I
was a Professor."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," Harry said evenly. "Though I think
Professor Quirrell deserves more credit than me."</p>
<p>The blue eyes widened. "Harry..."</p>
<p>"Those bullies were attacking victims long before this year,"
Harry said. Despite his best efforts, his voice was starting to
rise. "But nobody seems to have taught the students that they're
allowed to fight <i>back.</i> I know it's much harder to
<i>ignore</i> a two-sided fight than some helpless victims getting
hexed or almost pushed out of windows, but it's not exactly
<i>worse,</i> is it? I wish I'd read more of Godric Gryffindor's
writings so I could quote him, there's got to be something in there
about this. Open battle may be <i>louder</i> than the victims
suffering in silence, it may be harder to pretend that nothing is
happening, but the final result is better -"</p>
<p>"No, it is not," Dumbledore said. "It is not, Harry. To
<i>always</i> fight the darkness, to <i>never</i> let evil pass
unchallenged - that is not heroism, but simple pride. Even Godric
Gryffindor did not think that every war was worth fighting, though
he went his whole life from one battle to another." The old
wizard's voice went quieter. "In truth, Harry, the words you speak
- they are not evil. No, not evil, and yet they have frightened me.
You are one who might someday wield great power, over wizardry,
over your fellow wizards. And if, come that day, you still think
that evil must never pass unchallenged -" Now a note of real worry
had entered the Headmaster's voice. "The world has grown more
fragile since the age when Hogwarts was raised; I fear it cannot
bear the fury of another Godric Gryffindor. And he was slower to
his wrath than you." The old wizard shook his head. "You are too
ready to fight, Harry. Much too ready to fight, and Hogwarts itself
is becoming a more violent place around you."</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said carefully, after weighing his words. "I don't
know if it will help to say this, but I think you're getting the
wrong impression of what I'm all about. I don't like real fighting
either. It's scary, and violent, and somebody might get hurt. But I
<i>didn't</i> fight today, Headmaster."</p>
<p>The Headmaster frowned. "You sent the Defense Professor in your
place -"</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell didn't do any fighting either," Harry said
calmly. "There wasn't anyone there strong enough to fight him. What
happened today wasn't fighting, it was winning."</p>
<p>It was a while then before the old wizard spoke. "That may be as
it may be," the Headmaster said, "but all these conflicts must end.
I can hear the strain in the air, and with each of these clashes,
it rises. All this must end, decisively and soon; you must not
stand in the way of its ending."</p>
<p>The old wizard gestured toward the great oaken door of his
office, and Harry departed through it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was with some surprise that Harry stepped out from between
the huge grey gargoyles which had made way for him, and saw that
Quirinus Quirrell was still slumped against the stone of the
corridor wall, a thick thread of spittle drooling from his slack
mouth onto his Professorial robes, in just the same position he'd
occupied when Harry had first gone up into the Headmaster's
office.</p>
<p>Harry waited, but the slumped man didn't rise up; and after long
awkward seconds, Harry began to walk down the corridor again.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" came a soft call, after Harry had turned two
corners; a quiet voice carrying unnaturally through the halls.</p>
<p>When Harry had returned he found Professor Quirrell still
slumped against the wall, but the pale eyes now watched him with
keen intelligence.</p>
<p><i>I'm sorry to have tired you out -</i></p>
<p>It was something that Harry couldn't say. He'd noticed the
correlation between the effort Professor Quirrell expended and the
time he had to spend 'resting'. But Harry had reasoned that if the
effort was too painful or detrimental, surely Professor Quirrell
would just say no. Now Harry was wondering if that reasoning had
actually been correct, and if not, how to apologize...</p>
<p>The Defense Professor spoke in a quiet voice, the rest of the
body unmoving. "How went your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure," Harry said. "Not the way I predicted. He seems
to believe the Light should lose a lot more often than I'd consider
wise. Plus I'm not sure he understands the difference between
trying to fight and trying to win. It explains a lot, actually..."
Harry hadn't read much about the Wizarding War, but he'd read
enough to know that the good guys probably <i>had</i> acquired a
pretty accurate picture of who most of the worst Death Eaters were,
and <i>hadn't</i> just owled them all hand grenades over the course
of five minutes.</p>
<p>A soft, soft laugh from the pale lips. "Dumbledore does not
comprehend the enjoyment of winning, just as he does not comprehend
the enjoyment of the game. Tell me, Mr. Potter. Did you suggest
this little plan with the deliberate intention of relieving my
tedium?"</p>
<p>"That was among my many motives," Harry said, because some
instinct had warned that he couldn't just say <i>Yes</i>.</p>
<p>"Do you know," the Defense Professor said in soft reflective
tones, "there are those who have tried to soften my darker moods,
and those who have indeed participated in brightening my day, but
you are the first person ever to succeed in doing it deliberately?"
The Defense Professor seemed to straighten up from the wall with a
peculiar motion which might have included magic as well as muscle;
and the Defense Professor began to walk away without a look back in
Harry's direction. Only a single small gesture of one finger
indicated that Harry was to follow.</p>
<p>"I particularly enjoyed that chant you composed for Miss Davis,"
said Professor Quirrell after they had walked a short distance.
"Though you might have been wiser to consult me in advance, before
giving it to her to memorize." One hand bestirred itself to within
the Defense Professor's robes and drew forth a wand, which traced a
small gesture in the air, after which all the faraway sounds of the
castle Hogwarts fell silent. "Tell me honestly, Mr. Potter, have
you somehow acquired a familiarity with the theory of Dark rituals?
That is not the same as confessing an intent to cast them; many
wizards know the principles."</p>
<p>"No..." Harry said slowly. He had decided some time ago against
trying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts
library, for much the same reason he'd decided a year earlier
<i>not</i> to look up how to make explosives out of common
household materials. Harry prided himself on at least having
<i>more</i> sense than people thought he did.</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor Quirrell. The man was walking more normally
now, and the lips curved about in a peculiar smile. "Why, perhaps
you possess a natural talent for the field, then."</p>
<p>"Yes, well," Harry said wearily. "I suppose Dr. Seuss also has a
natural talent for Dark rituals, because the part about <i>shuffle,
duffle, muzzle, muff</i> came from a children's book called
<i>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</i> -"</p>
<p>"No, not that part," said Professor Quirrell. His voice grew a
little stronger, took on some of its normal lecturing tone. "An
ordinary Charm, Mr. Potter, can be cast merely by speaking certain
words, making precise motions of the wand, expending some of your
own strength. Even powerful spells may be invoked in this way, if
the magic is efficient as well as efficacious. But with the
greatest of magics, speech alone does not suffice to give them
structure. You must perform specific actions, make significant
choices. Nor is the temporary expenditure of your own strength
sufficient to set them in motion; a ritual requires permanent
sacrifice. The power of such a greater spell, compared to ordinary
Charms, can be like day compared to night. But many rituals -
indeed, most - happen to demand at least one sacrifice which might
inspire squeamishness. And so the entire field of ritual magic,
containing all the furthest and most interesting reaches of
wizardry, is widely regarded as Dark. With a few exceptions carved
out by tradition, of course." Professor Quirrell's voice took on a
sardonic tinge. "The Unbreakable Vow is too useful to certain
wealthy Houses to be outlawed entirely - even though to bind a
man's will through all his days is indeed a dread and terrible act,
more fearsome than many lesser rituals that wizards shun. A cynic
might conclude that which rituals are prohibited is not so much a
matter of morality, as habit. But I digress..." Professor Quirrell
made a brief coughing sound, a clearing of his throat. "The
Unbreakable Vow requires three participants and three sacrifices.
The one who receives the Unbreakable Vow must be one who could have
come to trust the Vower, but chooses instead to demand the Vow from
them, and they sacrifice that possibility of trust. The one who
makes the Vow must be someone who could have chosen to do what the
Vow demands of them, and they sacrifice that capacity for choice.
And the third wizard, the binder, permanently sacrifices a small
portion of their own magic, to sustain the Vow forever."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "I'd <i>wondered</i> why that spell wasn't
used all over the place, every time two people have difficulty
trusting each other... although... why don't wizards on their
deathbeds charge money to bind Unbreakable Vows, and use that to
leave an inheritance for their children -"</p>
<p>"Because they are stupid," said Professor Quirrell. "There are
hundreds of useful rituals which could be performed if men had so
much sense; I could name twenty without stopping to draw breath.
But in any case, Mr. Potter, the thing about such rituals - whether
or not you choose to term them Dark - is that they are shaped to be
magically efficacious, not to appear impressive when performed. I
suppose there is a certain tendency for the more powerful rituals
to require more dreadful sacrifices. Even so, the most terrible
ritual known to me demands only a rope which has hanged a man and a
sword which has slain a woman; and that for a ritual which promised
to summon Death itself - though what is truly meant by that I do
not know and do not care to discover, since it was also said that
the counterspell to dismiss Death had been lost. The most dread
chant I have encountered does not sound even a hundredth as
fearsome as the chant you composed for Miss Davis. Those among the
bullies who had a passing familiarity with Dark rituals - and I am
certain that there were some - must have been terrified beyond the
capacity of words to describe. If there existed a true ritual which
appeared that impressive, Mr. Potter, it would melt the Earth."</p>
<p>"Um," said Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips twisted further. "Ah, but the truly
amusing thing was this. You see, Mr. Potter, the chant of every
ritual names that which is to be sacrificed, and that which is to
be gained. The chant which you gave to Miss Davis spoke, first, of
a darkness beyond darkness, buried beneath the flow of time, which
knows the gate, and is the gate. And the second thing spoken of,
Mr. Potter, was the manifestation of your own presence. And always,
in each element of the ritual, <i>first</i> is named that which is
sacrificed, and <i>then</i> is said the use commanded of it."</p>
<p>"I... see," said Harry, as he trod through the halls of Hogwarts
after Professor Quirrell, following him toward the Defense
Professor's office. "So my chant, the way I wrote it, implies that
the Outer God, Yog-Sothoth -"</p>
<p>"Was permanently sacrificed in a ritual which but briefly
manifested your presence," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose we
will discover tomorrow whether anyone took that seriously, when we
read the newspapers and see whether all the magical nations of the
world are banding together in a desperate effort to seal off your
incursion into our reality."</p>
<p>They walked on, as the Defense Professor began chuckling, odd
throaty sounds.</p>
<p>The two of them didn't talk after that until they came to the
Defense Professor's office, and then the man halted with his hand
upon the door.</p>
<p>"It is a very strange thing," the Defense Professor said, his
voice now soft again, almost inaudible. The man was not looking at
Harry, and Harry saw only his back. "A very strange thing... There
was a time when I would have sacrificed a finger from my wand hand,
to work upon the bullies of Hogwarts as we have worked upon them
this day. To make them fear me as they now fear you, to have the
deference of all the students and the adoration of many, I would
have given my finger for that. You have everything now that I
wanted then. All that I know of human nature says that I should
hate you. And yet I do not. It is a very strange thing."</p>
<p>It should have been a touching moment, but instead Harry felt a
coldness traveling down his spine, as though he were a little fish
in the sea, and some vast white shark had just looked him over and
decided after a visible hesitation not to eat him.</p>
<p>The man opened the door to Defense Professor's office, and
passed within, and was gone.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>Her fellow Slytherins were looking at Daphne like... like they
didn't have the faintest idea of how to look at her.</p>
<p>The Gryffindors were looking at her like they didn't have the
faintest idea of how to look at her.</p>
<p>Showing no fear, Daphne Greengrass strode into the Potions
classroom, wrapped in the imperious dignity of a Noble and Most
Ancient House. Inside she was feeling much the same way everyone
else probably did.</p>
<p>It had been two hours since the <i>What?</i> when the
<i>What?</i> had happened and Daphne's brain was still going:
<i>What? What? What?</i></p>
<p>The classroom was quiet as they all waited for Professor Snape
to arrive. Lavender and Parvati sat near a cluster of other
Gryffindors, surrounded by silent stares. The two of them were
looking over each other's homework before class started, and nobody
else was helping them or talking to them. Even Lavender, who Daphne
would have sworn could never be fazed by anything, seemed
subdued.</p>
<p>Daphne sat down at her desk, and took <i>Magical Draughts and
Potions</i> out of her bag, and began looking over her own
homework, doing her very best to act normal. People stared at her,
and said nothing -</p>
<p>A gasp went through the whole classroom. Girls and boys flinched
back, leaning away from the door like they were stalks of wheat
touched by a gust of wind.</p>
<p>In the door stood Tracey Davis, wrapped in a black tattered
cloak which had been draped over her Hogwarts uniform.</p>
<p>Tracey walked slowly into the classroom, swaying slightly with
each step, looking like she was trying to <i>drift</i>. She sat
down at her accustomed desk, which happened to be right next to
Daphne's.</p>
<p>Slowly Tracey's head turned to stare at Daphne.</p>
<p>"See?" the Slytherin girl said in a low, sepulchral tone. "I
told you I'd get him before she did."</p>
<p>"What?" blurted Daphne, who immediately wished she hadn't said
anything.</p>
<p>"I got Harry Potter before Granger did." Tracey's voice was
still low, but her eyes were gleaming with triumph. "See, Daphne,
what General Potter wants in a girl isn't a pretty face or a pretty
dress. He wants a girl willing to channel his dread powers, that's
what he wants. Now I'm his - and he's mine!"</p>
<p>This announcement produced a frozen silence through the whole
classroom.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Miss Davis," said the cultured voice of Draco
Malfoy, who seemed unconcerned as he shuffled through his own
Potions parchments. The other scion of a Most Ancient House didn't
so much as glance up from his desk, even as everyone else turned to
look at him. "Did Harry Potter actually <i>tell</i> you that? Using
those words?"</p>
<p>"Well, no..." Tracey said, and then her eyes flashed angrily.
"But he'd <i>better</i> take me in, now that I've sacrificed my
soul to him and everything!"</p>
<p>"<i>You sacrificed your soul to Harry Potter?</i>" gasped
Millicent. There was a clatter from the other side of the room as
Ron Weasley dropped his inkwell.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly
uncertain before she rallied. "I mean, I looked at myself in a
mirror and I look paler now, and I can always feel darkness
surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and
everything... Daphne, you also saw my eyes go green, right? I
didn't see it myself but that's what I heard afterward."</p>
<p>There was a pause, broken only by the sounds of Ron Weasley
trying to clean up his desk.</p>
<p>"Daphne?" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it," said an angry voice. "There's no way the
next Dark Lord would take <i>you</i> to be his bride!"</p>
<p>Slowly, and with considerable disbelief, heads turned to stare
at Pansy Parkinson.</p>
<p>"Hush, you," said Tracey, "or I'll..." The Slytherin girl
paused. Then Tracey's voice went even lower, and she said, "Hush,
you, or I'll devour your soul."</p>
<p>"You can't do that," said Pansy, in the confident tones of a hen
which had worked out a perfectly good pecking order where she was
at the top, and wasn't about to go updating that belief based on
mere evidence.</p>
<p>Slowly, like she was trying to float, Tracey got up from her
desk. There were more gasps. Daphne felt like she'd been Petrified
in place within her chair.</p>
<p>"Tracey?" said Lavender in a small voice. "Please don't do all
that again. Please?"</p>
<p>Now Pansy was showing definite nervousness as Tracey swayed
toward her desk. "What d'you think you're doing?" Pansy said, not
quite managing to sound indignant.</p>
<p>"I told you," Tracey said menacingly. "I'm going to devour your
soul."</p>
<p>Tracey bent down over Pansy, who sat frozen at her desk; and,
with their lips almost touching, made a loud inhaling noise.</p>
<p>"There!" said Tracey as she straightened. "I ate your soul."</p>
<p>"No you didn't!" said Pansy.</p>
<p>"Did too!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>There was a very slight pause -</p>
<p>"Merlin, she <i>did!</i>" cried Theodore Nott. "You look all
pale now, and your eyes seem empty!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" screeched Pansy, turning pale. The girl leapt up
from her desk and began frantically rummaging through her bookbag.
After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she turned
even paler.</p>
<p>Daphne abandoned all pretense of aristocratic poise and let her
head fall to the desk with a dull thud, as she wondered whether
going to the same school as all the other important families was
really worth going to the same school as the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>"Ooh, you're in trouble now, Pansy," said Seamus Finnigan. "I
don't know exactly what happens when a Dementor Kisses you, but if
Tracey Davis kisses you that's probably even worse."</p>
<p>"I've heard about people without souls," Dean Thomas said
gloomily. "They have to dress all in black, and they write awful
poetry, and nothing ever makes them happy. They're all
<i>angsty</i>."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be angsty!" cried Pansy.</p>
<p>"Too bad," said Dean Thomas. "You've got to be, now that your
soul's gone."</p>
<p>Pansy turned, and stretched out a begging hand toward Draco
Malfoy's desk. "Draco!" she said pleadingly. "Mr. Malfoy! Please,
make Tracey give me back my soul!"</p>
<p>"I can't," said Tracey. "I <i>ate</i> it."</p>
<p>"Make her throw it up!" yelled Pansy.</p>
<p>The heir of Malfoy had slumped forward, resting his head in both
hands, so that nobody could see his face. "Why is my life like
this?" said Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>A wild babble of whispers started up as Tracey returned to her
desk, now smiling in satisfaction, while Pansy stood in the midst
of the classroom, wringing her hands and tears starting from her
eyes -</p>
<p><i>"Be. Quiet."</i></p>
<p>The soft, lethal voice seemed to fill the whole classroom as
Professor Snape stalked in through the door. His face was angrier
than Daphne had ever seen it, sending a jolt of genuine fear down
her spine. Hastily she looked down at her homework.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Parkinson," the Potions Master hissed, "and you,
Davis, take off that ridiculous cloak -"</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Snaaaaaape!</i>" wailed Pansy Parkinson in tears.
"<i>Tracey ate my sooouuul!</i>"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="75">Chapter 75</h2><h3>Self Actualization Final,
Responsibility</h3>
<p>It was a looping, meandering alley in the midst of Hogwarts,
wandering like a stray lock of hair; sometimes crossing itself, it
seemed, but you couldn't ever get to the end if you gave into the
temptation of apparent shortcuts.</p>
<p>At the end of the tangle, six students leaned against rough
stones, robes black against the grey walls and trimmed in green,
eyes darting from one to each other. Torches burned in the
windowless sconce, casting light to ward off the darkness and heat
to ward off the chill of the Slytherin dungeons.</p>
<p>"I am <i>certain,</i>" Reese Belka snapped, "absolutely
<i>certain,</i> that was no true ritual. Little firstie witches
can't do that kind of magic, and even if they could, who's ever
heard of a Dark ritual which <i>sacrifices</i> a sealed horror for
- <i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>"Were you -" said Lucian Bole. "I mean - after that girl snapped
her fingers -"</p>
<p>Belka's glare should have melted him. "No," she spat, "I was
<i>not.</i>"</p>
<p>"That is, she wasn't naked," drawled Marcus Flint, his broad
shoulders leaning back in apparent relaxation against the lumpy
stone surface. "Covered in chocolate frosting, yes, but not
naked."</p>
<p>"This day Potter has offered great insult to our Houses," said
the grim voice of Jaime Astorga.</p>
<p>"Yes, well, I'm sorry to be blunt," Randolph Lee said evenly.
The seventh-year duelist rubbed at his chin, where a faint fuzz of
beard had been allowed to grow. "But when someone sticks you to the
ceiling, it's a message, Astorga. It's a message which says: I'm an
incredibly powerful Dark Wizard who could've done anything to you I
damn well pleased, and I don't care if your House is offended,
either."</p>
<p>Robert Jugson III gave a soft, low laugh at this, a chuckle that
sent chills down several spines. "It makes you wonder if you picked
the wrong side, doesn't it? I've heard tales about <i>messages</i>
like that, sent at the old Dark Lord's bidding..."</p>
<p>"I'm not ready to kneel to Potter just yet," said Astorga,
staring hard into Jugson's eyes.</p>
<p>"Neither am I," said Belka.</p>
<p>Jugson was holding his wand, and he turned it idly back and
forth in his fingers, pointing it up and then downward. "Are you a
Gryffindor or a Slytherin?" said Jugson. "Everyone's got a price.
Everyone smart."</p>
<p>This statement produced a moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't Malfoy be here?" Bole said tentatively.</p>
<p>Flint gave a dismissive flick of his fingers. "Whatever Malfoy's
plotting, he wants to put on an air of innocence. He can't be seen
missing at the same time as us."</p>
<p>"But everyone <i>knows</i> that already," said Bole. "Even in
the other Houses."</p>
<p>"Yes, very clumsy," said Belka. She snorted. "Malfoy or no, he's
just a little firstie and we don't need him here."</p>
<p>"I will owl my father," Jugson said softly, "and <i>he</i> will
speak to Lord Malfoy himself -" Abruptly, Jugson stopped
speaking.</p>
<p>"I don't know about <i>you</i>, dearies," Belka said with fake
sweetness, "but <i>I</i> don't plan on running scared from a false
ritual, and <i>I'm</i> not done with Potter and his pet
mudblood."</p>
<p>Nobody answered. All their gazes were looking past her.</p>
<p>Slowly, Belka turned around to see what the others were staring
at.</p>
<p>"You will do <i>nothing,</i>" hissed their Head of House.
Severus Snape's face was enraged, when he spoke small spots of
spittle flew from his mouth, further dotting his already-dirtied
robes. "You fools have done <i>enough!</i> You have embarrassed my
House - <i>lost</i> to first-years - now you speak of embroiling
noble Lords of the Wizengamot in your <i>pathetic</i> childish
squabbles? <i>I</i> shall deal with this matter. <i>You</i> will
not embarrass this House again, you will not <i>risk</i>
embarrassing this House again! You are <i>done</i> with fighting
witches, and if I hear otherwise -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>If you thought they'd be sitting next to each other at
dinnertime, after that, you'd be quite mistaken.</p>
<p>"What does she <i>want</i> from me?" came the plaintive cry of a
boy who, for all his extensive reading in the scientific
literature, was still a bit naive about certain things. "Did she
<i>want</i> to get beaten up?"</p>
<p>The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who'd sat down next to him at the
dinner-table exchanged swift glances with each other until, by some
unspoken protocol, the most experienced of their number spoke.</p>
<p>"Look," said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in
their competition by three witches and a Defense Professor, "the
thing you've got to understand is, just because she's <i>angry</i>
doesn't mean you lost points. Miss Granger is angry because she got
all frightened and you're <i>there to be blamed,</i> you
understand? But at the same time, even though she won't admit it,
she'll be touched that her boyfriend went to such ridiculous and
frankly insane lengths to protect her."</p>
<p>"This is not about <i>points,</i>" ground out Harry Potter, the
words visibly escaping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner sat
ignored on the table in front of him. "This is about
<i>justice.</i> And <i>I. Am. Not. Her. Boyfriend!</i>"</p>
<p>This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all
present.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well," said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, "I think after
she kisses you to bring you out of Dementation and you stick
forty-four bullies to the ceiling for her, we've gone way past
'she's not my girlfriend, really' and into the question of what
your kids will be like. Wow, that's a scary thought..." The
Ravenclaw trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice, "Please
don't look at me like that."</p>
<p>"Look," said Arty Grey, "I'm sorry to be blunt about this, but
you can have justice or you can have girls, you can't have both at
the same time." He clapped a companionable hand on Harry Potter's
shoulder. "You've got potential, kid, more potential than any
wizard I've ever seen, but you've got to learn how to <i>use</i>
it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to clean
up that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your
evilness better - not <i>too</i> well, but better. Nice
well-groomed boys get girls, and Dark Wizards also get girls, but
nice well-groomed boys suspected of being <i>secretly</i> Dark get
more girls than you can imagine -"</p>
<p>"Not interested," Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy's
hand from his shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it.</p>
<p>"But you will be," said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding.
"Ah, you will be!"</p>
<p>Elsewhere along the same table -</p>
<p>"<i>Romantic?</i>" shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that
some of the girls next to her winced. "<i>What part of that was
romantic?</i> He didn't <i>ask!</i> He never <i>asks!</i> He just
sends ghosts after people and glues them to ceilings and does
whatever he wants with <i>my</i> life!"</p>
<p>"But don't you see?" said a fourth-year witch. "It means that
even though he's evil, he <i>loves</i> you!"</p>
<p>"You're not helping," said Penelope Clearwater a little further
down the table, but she was ignored. Several older witches had
started toward Hermione, after she'd sat down at the extreme
opposite end of the table from Harry Potter, but then a swifter
cloud of younger girls had surrounded Hermione in an impenetrable
barrier.</p>
<p>"Boys," said Hermione Granger, "should not be allowed to love
girls without asking them first! This is true in a number of ways
and especially when it comes to gluing people to the ceiling!"</p>
<p>This was also ignored. "It's just like a play!" sighed a
third-year girl.</p>
<p>"A play?" said Hermione. "I'd like to see the play where
anything like <i>this</i> happens!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said the third-year girl, "I was thinking of that really
<i>romantic</i> one where there's this very nice, sweet boy who
makes a Floo call, only he mispronounces his destination and
stumbles out into this room full of Dark Wizards who are performing
a forbidden ritual that should've stayed forever lost to time, and
they're sacrificing seven victims in order to unseal this ancient
horror which is supposed to grant someone a wish if it's freed, so
of course the boy's presence interrupts the ritual, and as the
horror is eating all the Dark Wizards and everyone is dying the
boy's last thought is that he wishes he could've had a girlfriend,
and the next thing you know the boy is lying in the lap of this
beautiful woman whose eyes are burning with a dreadful light, only
she doesn't understand anything about being human so the boy always
has to stop her eating people. This is just like that play, only
you're the boy and Harry Potter is the girl!"</p>
<p>"That..." Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. "That actually
<i>does</i> sound something like -"</p>
<p>"It <i>does?</i>" blurted a second-year girl sitting across the
table, who was now leaning forward, looking horrified and yet even
more fascinated.</p>
<p>"No!" said Hermione. "I mean - <i>he's not my
boyfriend!</i>"</p>
<p>Two seconds later, Hermione's ears caught up with what her lips
had just said.</p>
<p>The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione's shoulder and
gave her a comforting squeeze. "Miss Granger," she said in a
soothing voice, "I think if you're really honest with yourself,
you'll admit that the real reason you're angry with your dark
master is that he channeled his unspeakable powers through Tracey
Davis instead of you."</p>
<p>Hermione's mouth opened but her throat locked up before the
words came out, which was probably a good thing, because if she'd
actually yelled that loudly it would've broken something.</p>
<p>"How's that possible, actually?" said the third-year girl. "I
mean for Harry Potter to work through another girl even though he's
bound himself to you? Do the three of you have one of those, you
know, arrangements?"</p>
<p>"<i>Gaaaaack,</i>" said Hermione Granger, her throat still
locked, her brain halted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making
a noise like she was coughing up a yak.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>(Later.)</i></p>
<p>"I don't understand why you're being so <i>unreasonable</i>,"
said another second-year witch, who'd replaced the third-year-girl
after Hermione had threatened to ask Tracey to eat her soul. "I
mean, really, if someone like Harry Potter rescued <i>me</i>, I'd
be - sending him thank-you cards, and hugging him, and," the girl's
face was a bit red, "well, kissing him, I'd hope."</p>
<p>"Yeah!" said the other second-year witch. "I've never understood
why girls in plays get <i>angry</i> when the main character goes
out of his way to be nice to them. <i>I</i> wouldn't act like that
if the hero liked <i>me.</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione Granger had dropped her head to the dinner table, her
hands slowly pulling at her hair.</p>
<p>"You just don't understand male psychology," the fourth-year
witch said in an authoritative voice. "Granger's got to make it
<i>look</i> like she can mysteriously resist his seductive
charm."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>(Even later.)</i></p>
<p>And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only
person left she could talk to, the only person guaranteed to
understand her point of view -</p>
<p>"They're all mad," said Hermione Granger as she strode
vigorously toward Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early.
"Everyone except you and me, Harry, I mean <i>everyone</i> except
us in this whole school of Hogwarts, they're all entirely
<i>mad.</i> And Ravenclaw girls are the <i>worst,</i> I don't know
<i>what</i> Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older, but I'm
certain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me if the
two of us had soul-bonded, which I'm going to look up in the
library tonight, but I'm pretty sure has never actually happened
-"</p>
<p>"I don't even know a <i>name</i> for this kind of fallacious
reasoning," said Harry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which
meant he often had to skip forward a few steps to match her own
indignation-fueled speed. "I seriously think if it was up to
<i>them</i>, they'd be dragging us off this minute to get our names
changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger... Ugh, saying that out loud
makes me realize how awful it sounds."</p>
<p>"You mean <i>your</i> name would be Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger
and <i>mine</i> would be Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres," said
Hermione. "It's too horrible to imagine."</p>
<p>"No," said the boy, "House Potter is a Noble House, so I think
that name stays in front -"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" she said indignantly. "Who says <i>we</i> have
to -"</p>
<p>There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of
their shoes.</p>
<p>"<i>Anyhow,</i>" Hermione said hastily, "some of the crazy
things they said at dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say,
Harry, that I really am grateful to you for saving me and everybody
from getting beat up, and even though some parts of this afternoon
upset me, I'm sure we can just talk about it calmly."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes
showing a mixture of befuddlement and apprehension, "that's...
good, I guess?"</p>
<p>To be specific, there'd been the fourth-year witch explaining
that, since Harry was the evil wizard who'd fallen in love with
Hermione, and Hermione was the pure and innocent girl who would
either redeem him or get seduced by the Dark Arts herself, it
followed that Hermione <i>had</i> to be perpetually indignant at
anything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from
certain doom, just so that their romance wouldn't resolve itself
before the end of Act IV. And <i>then</i> Penelope Clearwater, who
Hermione had really thought was smarter than that, had remarked in
a loud voice that for identical reasons it was <i>impossible</i>
for Hermione to just go over and talk sensibly with Harry about why
she was feeling hurt, and anyway Dark Wizards were attracted to
passionate defiance in a woman, not logic. This was the point at
which Hermione had shoved herself up from the benches, stomped
furiously over to where Harry was sitting, and asked him in a
reasonable voice if the two of them could go for a walk and sort
things out.</p>
<p>"So in other words," Hermione said in her calmest voice ever,
"you're not really in trouble with me, I'm still talking to you,
we're still friends, and we're still studying together. We're
<i>not</i> having a fight. Right?"</p>
<p>Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter's
apprehension. "Right," said the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"Great!" said Hermione. "So, <i>have</i> you worked out why I
was upset, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>There was a pause. "You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?"
Harry said cautiously. "I mean - I know you wanted to do things on
your own. And I <i>was</i> staying out of your way, until I'd heard
you'd gotten ambushed by three junior Death Eaters and, honestly, I
wasn't expecting that. <i>Professor Quirrell</i> wasn't expecting
that. I started to worry you'd gotten in over your head and then,
no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a massed ambush is way
beyond what <i>anyone</i> could handle without help. That's why I
thought you really needed help just that once -"</p>
<p>"No, that part's fine," said Hermione. "We <i>were</i> in over
our heads, honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Um," said Harry. "What Tracey did... startled you?"</p>
<p>"Startled me, Mr. Potter?" There might have been a touch of
acidity in her voice. "No, Mr. Potter, I was <i>scared.</i> I was
<i>frightened.</i> I wouldn't want to admit to being afraid of just
<i>dragons</i> or something, people might think I was
<i>cowardly</i>, but when you can hear distant voices crying
'Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!' and there's pools of blood seeping out from
under all the doors, then it's okay to be scared."</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> sorry," Harry said with what sounded like genuine
regret. "I thought you'd realize it was me."</p>
<p>"And the <i>reason</i> we all got scared like that, Mr. Potter,
was that <i>you didn't ask first!</i>" Despite her intentions,
Hermione found her voice was rising again. "You should've
<i>asked</i> me before you did something like that, Harry! You
should've said very specifically, 'Hermione, can I make blood come
out from under the doors?' It's important to be specific when
you're asking about that sort of thing!"</p>
<p>The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. "I...
honestly, I just thought you'd <i>have</i> to say no."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter, <i>I could've said no</i>. That's <i>the whole
point of asking first</i>, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>"No, I mean you'd have <i>had</i> to say no, whether or not it
was what you <i>really</i> wanted. And then all of you would've
gotten beaten up and it would've been <i>my</i> fault for asking
first."</p>
<p>Hermione's eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept
walking for a few steps while she tried to understand this. "What?"
she said.</p>
<p>"Well..." the boy said a bit slowly. "I mean... you're the
Sunshine General, aren't you? You <i>couldn't</i> say yes to me
scaring people, not even bullies, not even to save your friends
from getting beaten up. You would've <i>had</i> to say no, and then
you would've gotten hurt. This way, you can tell people honestly
that you had no idea and that it wasn't your fault. That's why I
didn't warn you."</p>
<p>Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead
of just turning her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said,
"Harry, you've <i>got</i> to stop coming up with clever reasons for
doing stupid things."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, "Look... I
know what you mean, of course, but there's still the question of
whether it's actually <i>is</i> a good idea, not just a clever one
-"</p>
<p>"I understand why you did what you did today," Hermione said.
"But I want you to promise that from now on, you'll ask me first,
always, even if you can come up with a reason why you
shouldn't."</p>
<p>There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her
heart sinking.</p>
<p>"Hermione -" Harry started to say.</p>
<p>"<i>Why?</i>" The frustration burst out into her voice. "<i>Why
is it so awful? All you have to do is ask!"</i></p>
<p>Harry's eyes were very serious. "Who in S.P.H.E.W. do you try
hardest to defend, Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you
fight?"</p>
<p>"Hannah Abbott," Hermione said without having to think about it,
and then felt a little bad, because Hannah <i>was</i> trying hard
and she <i>had</i> improved a lot -</p>
<p>"Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey,
with <i>final</i> responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you knew
Hannah was about to walk into an ambush, and you came up with a
plan for protecting her, would you feel good about letting Tracey
say whether or not you were allowed to do it?"</p>
<p>"Well... no?" said Hermione, puzzled.</p>
<p>The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. "Would
you trust <i>Hannah</i> to have the final say in whether she needed
protecting?"</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew
the right answer and she also knew the right answer wasn't actually
true. Hannah was trying so hard to prove she wasn't afraid, even
though she <i>was,</i> and it was easy to see how the Hufflepuff
girl might try <i>too</i> hard -</p>
<p>Then Hermione realized the implication. "You think I'm like
<i>Hannah?</i>"</p>
<p>"Not... exactly..." Harry ran his hands through his mess of
hair. "Listen, Hermione, what would <i>you</i> have suggested
doing, if I'd warned you about an ambush by forty-four
bullies?"</p>
<p>"I would've done the <i>responsible</i> thing and told
<i>Professor McGonagall</i> and let <i>her</i> take care of it,"
Hermione said promptly. "And <i>then</i> there wouldn't have been
darkness and people screaming and horrible blue light -"</p>
<p>But Harry just shook his head. "That's <i>not</i> the
responsible thing to do, Hermione. It's what someone playing the
<i>role</i> of a responsible girl would do. <i>Yes</i>, I thought
of going to Professor McGonagall. But she would've only stopped the
disaster <i>once.</i> Probably before any disturbance happened in
the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew. If the
bullies got punished just for plotting, it would be by losing House
points, or at worst a day's detention, not anything that would
really scare them. And then the bullies would have <i>tried
again</i>. Fewer of them, with better operational security so I
didn't hear about it. They would probably ambush <i>one</i> of you,
alone. Professor McGonagall doesn't have the <i>authority</i> to do
something scary enough to protect you - and <i>she</i> wouldn't
have overstepped her authority, because she's not really
responsible."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor McGonagall</i> isn't responsible?" Hermione said
incredulously. She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring
at him. "Are you <i>nuts?"</i></p>
<p>The boy didn't blink. "You could call it heroic responsibility,
maybe," Harry Potter said. "Not like the usual sort. It means that
whatever happens, no matter what, it's <i>always</i> your fault.
Even if you tell Professor McGonagall, she's not responsible for
what happens, <i>you</i> are. Following the school rules isn't an
excuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying
your best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've
got to <i>get the job done no matter what</i>." Harry's face
tightened. "That's why I say you're not thinking responsibly,
Hermione. Thinking that your job is done when you tell Professor
McGonagall - that isn't heroine thinking. Like Hannah being beat up
is <i>okay</i> then, because it isn't <i>your fault</i> anymore.
Being a heroine means your job isn't finished until you've done
<i>whatever it takes</i> to protect the other girls,
<i>permanently.</i>" In Harry's voice was a touch of the steel he
had acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his shoulder. "You
can't think as if just following the rules means you've done your
duty."</p>
<p>"I think," Hermione said evenly, "that you and I might disagree
about some things, Mr. Potter. Like whether you or Professor
McGonagall is more <i>responsible</i>, and whether being
<i>responsible</i> usually involves people running around and
screaming, and how much it's a good idea to follow school rules.
And just because we disagree, Mr. Potter, doesn't mean that
<i>you</i> get the final say."</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "you asked what was <i>so</i> awful about
having to ask you first, and it was a surprisingly good question,
so I examined my mind and that's what I found. I think my real fear
is that if Hannah is in trouble and I come up with a way to save
her that seems weird or dark or something, you might not weigh the
consequences to Hannah. You might not accept the heroine's
responsibility of coming up with <i>some</i> way to save her,
somehow, no matter what. Instead you'd just carry out the
<i>role</i> of Hermione Granger, the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and
the <i>role</i> of Hermione Granger automatically says no, whether
or not she has a better plan in mind. And then forty-four bullies
will take turns beating up Hannah Abbott, and it'll all be my fault
because I <i>knew,</i> even if I didn't want reality to be that
way, I knew that was how it would go. I'm pretty sure that was my
secret, wordless, unutterable fear."</p>
<p>The frustration was building up inside her again. "It's
<i>my</i> life!" Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it
would be like with Harry messing with her all the time, constantly
inventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to
her objections. She shouldn't have to <i>win an argument</i> just
to - "There'll <i>always</i> be some reason, you can <i>always</i>
say I'm not thinking right! I want my <i>own life!</i> Otherwise
I'll walk away, I really will, I mean it Harry."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "This is exactly where I didn't want things to end
up, and here we are. You're afraid of just the same thing I am,
aren't you? Afraid that if <i>you</i> let go of the steering wheel,
we'll crash." The corners of his lips twisted, but it didn't look
like a real smile. "That's something I can understand."</p>
<p>"I don't think you understand <i>at all!</i>" Hermione said
sharply. "You said we'd be <i>partners,</i> Harry!"</p>
<p>That stopped him, she could see it stop him.</p>
<p>"How about this?" Harry said at last. "I'll promise to ask you
first before I do anything that could be interpreted as meddling in
your affairs. Only <i>you've</i> got to promise <i>me</i> to be
reasonable, Hermione. I mean <i>really</i>, genuinely, stop and
think for twenty seconds first, treat it as a real choice. The sort
of reasonableness where you realize I'm offering a way to protect
the other girls, and that if you automatically say <i>no</i>
without considering it properly, there's this <i>actual
consequence</i> where Hannah Abbott ends up in the hospital."</p>
<p>Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound down.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have to make promises," she said, "just to be
<i>consulted</i> about <i>my own life.</i>" She turned from Harry
and began walking toward the Ravenclaw tower, not looking at him.
"But I'll think about it, anyway."</p>
<p>She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for
a while, passing through an archway of some reddish metal like
copper, into a corridor that was just like the one they'd left
except that it was tiled in pentagons instead of squares.</p>
<p>"Hermione..." said Harry. "I've been watching you and thinking,
since the day you said you were going to be a hero. You've
<i>got</i> the courage. You'll fight for what's right, even in the
face of enemies that would scare other people away. You've
certainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you're probably a
better person inside than I am. But even so... well, to be honest,
Hermione... I can't quite see you filling Dumbledore's shoes,
leading magical Britain's fight against You-Know-Who. Not yet,
anyway."</p>
<p>Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went on
walking, as though lost in thought. Fill <i>those</i> shoes? She'd
never tried to imagine herself that way. She'd never
<i>imagined</i> imagining herself that way.</p>
<p>"And maybe I'm wrong," Harry said as they walked. "Maybe I've
just read too many stories where the heroes never do the sensible
thing and follow the rules and tell their Professor McGonagalls, so
my brain doesn't think you're a proper storybook hero. Maybe it's
you who's the sane one, Hermione, and me who's just being silly.
But every time you talk about following rules or relying on
teachers, I get that same feeling, like it's bound up with this one
last thing that's stopping you, one last thing that puts your PC
self to sleep and turns you into an NPC again..." Harry let out a
sigh. "Maybe that's why Dumbledore said I should have wicked
stepparents."</p>
<p>"He said <i>what?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "I still don't know whether the Headmaster was
joking or... the thing is, he was <i>right</i> in a way. I
<i>had</i> loving parents, but I never felt like I could trust
their decisions, they weren't <i>sane</i> enough. I always knew
that if I didn't think things through myself, I might get hurt.
Professor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done
<i>if</i> I'm there to nag her about it, she doesn't break rules on
her own without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really
<i>is</i> someone who gets things done no matter what, and he's the
only other person I know who notices stuff like the Snitch ruining
Quidditch. But <i>him</i> I can't trust to be <i>good</i>. Even if
it's sad, I think that's part of the environment that creates what
Dumbledore calls a hero - people who don't have anyone else to
shove final responsibility onto, and that's why they form the
mental habit of tracking everything themselves."<i><br /></i></p>
<p>Hermione didn't say anything to that, but she was thinking back
to something Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very
short autobiography. Briefly and without any explanation, because
the scroll had been meant to be copied by hand, centuries before
the Muggle printing press had inspired wizards to invent the
Reading-Writing Quill.</p>
<p><i>No rescuer hath the rescuer,</i> Godric Gryffindor had
written. <i>No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father,
only nothingness above.</i></p>
<p>If <i>that</i> was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn't
sure she wanted to pay it. Or maybe - though it wasn't the sort of
thing she would have thought, before she started hanging around
Harry - maybe Godric Gryffindor had gotten it <i>wrong</i>.</p>
<p>"Do you trust <i>Dumbledore?"</i> Hermione said. "I mean, he's
right here in our school and he's the most legendary hero in the
whole world -"</p>
<p>"He <i>was</i> the most legendary hero," said Harry. "Now he
sets chickens on fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to
<i>you?</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione didn't answer.</p>
<p>Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral
stairs, the steps alternating between bronze metal and blue stone;
the final approach to where the Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard
their dorm with silly riddles.</p>
<p>"Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you," Harry
said when they were about halfway up. "Since it affects your life
and all. Think of it as a sort of down payment -"</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I predict S.P.H.E.W. is about to retire."</p>
<p>"<i>Retire?</i>" Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of the
stairs.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said. "I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the
teachers are about to clamp down hard on fighting in the
corridors." Harry was grinning as he spoke, a glint in his eyes
behind the glasses hinting at secret knowledge. "Cast new wards to
detect offensive hexes, or start verifying reports of bullying
using Veritaserum - I can think of several ways they might shut it
down. But if I'm right, it's something to celebrate, Hermione, you
and all of you. You kicked up enough public ruckus that you got
them to actually <i>do</i> something about the bullying. <i>All</i>
the bullying."</p>
<p>Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she
reached the top of the stairs and began walking toward the
Ravenclaw portrait for her riddle, Hermione felt rather lighter on
her feet, a wonderful lifting feeling spreading through her like
she'd been pumped full of helium.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in,
she hadn't expected <i>that</i> much, she hadn't expected it to
actually <i>work</i>.</p>
<p>They'd made a <i>difference...</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was the end of breakfast-time on the next morning.</p>
<p>The students from every year sat very still in their benches,
all heads turned in the same direction, toward the Head Table,
before which one lone first-year girl stood rigid and motionless,
her head tilted back to stare up at the Head of House
Slytherin.</p>
<p>Professor Snape's face was twisted with fury and triumph,
vindictive as any painting of a Dark Wizard; and behind him the
other Professors sat at the Head Table, watching with faces as
though carved from stone.</p>
<p>"- permanently disbanded," spat the Potions Master. "Your
self-proclaimed Society is <i>outlawed</i> within Hogwarts, by my
decision as a Professor! If your Society or any member of it is
discovered fighting in the hallways again, Granger, you will be
<i>personally</i> held responsible and expelled, by me, from the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"</p>
<p>That first-year girl stood there, before the Head Table where
she'd been called before only to receive commendations and smiles;
stood there with her spine held tall and upright in its curve like
a centaur's bow, giving nothing to the enemy.</p>
<p>That first-year witch stood there with all tears and anger
bottled, her face still, nothing changing of her outward
appearance, while something slowly broke inside her, she could feel
it breaking.</p>
<p>It broke further when Professor Snape gave her two weeks
detention for the crime of violence in school, sneering with the
contemptuous face he'd shown them all on the first day of Potions,
and with a little twist in the corner of his smile that said the
Potions Master knew exactly how unfair he was being.</p>
<p>Whatever-it-was inside her cracked all the way through, from top
to bottom, when Professor Snape took one hundred points from
Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>It ended, then, and Snape told her she was dismissed.</p>
<p>She turned around and saw that at the Ravenclaw table, Harry
Potter was sitting still in his place, she couldn't see his
expression from here, she saw his fists on the table but she
couldn't see if they were clenched white like her own. She had
whispered to him, when Professor Snape had called her, that he
wasn't to do anything without asking first.</p>
<p>Hermione wheeled back again to look at the Head Table, just as
Snape was turning away from her to resume his place.</p>
<p>"I said you're dismissed, girl," said the sneering voice, but
there was a pleased smile on Snape's face, like he was waiting for
her to do something -</p>
<p>Hermione strode forward another five steps toward the Head Table
and said in a breaking voice, "Headmaster?"</p>
<p>Utter silence filled the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, didn't move. It was as
though he, too, was just carved from stone.</p>
<p>Hermione turned her gaze to look at Professor Flitwick, whose
head, barely visible above the table, seemed to be staring down
into his lap. Beside him, Professor Sprout's face was very tight,
she seemed to be forcing herself to watch, and her lips were
trembling, but she said nothing.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's chair was empty, the Deputy Headmistress
hadn't shown up to breakfast that morning.</p>
<p>"Why aren't any of you saying anything?" said Hermione Granger.
Her voice was trembling with the last of her hope, the last
desperate reach for help from that place inside her. "You
<i>know</i> what he's doing is wrong!"</p>
<p>"Two more weeks' detention, for insolence," Snape said
silkily.</p>
<p>It shattered.</p>
<p>She looked at the Head Table for a few seconds longer, at
Professor Flitwick and Professor Sprout and the empty place where
Professor McGonagall should've been. Then Hermione Granger turned
and began walking toward the Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>There was a babble of voices starting up, as the students came
unfrozen from where they'd sat.</p>
<p>And then, as she was almost to the Ravenclaw table -</p>
<p>The dry voice of Professor Quirrell cut through everything, and
that voice said, "One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what
is right."</p>
<p>Hermione almost fell over her own feet; and then she continued
forward, even as Snape shouted something furious, even as Professor
Quirrell leaned back in his chair and began to laugh, even as
Dumbledore's voice was saying something she didn't catch and then
she was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table again next to Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was frozen beside her, he looked like someone who
didn't dare move.</p>
<p>"It's all right," her voice said to him, automatically without
there being any choice or thought involved, although really it
wasn't right at all. "But can you see if you can get me out of
Snape's detentions, like you did yourself that time?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded, a single jerky motion of his head. "I -"
said Harry. "I - I'm sorry, this - this is all my fault -"</p>
<p>"Don't be <i>ridiculous</i>, Harry." It was odd how her voice
was coming out all normal, and without her thinking about what to
say. Hermione looked down at her breakfast plate, but eating seemed
to be clearly out of the question, there was a roiling and churning
in her stomach which suggested that she was already on the verge of
throwing up, which was odd because she could have sworn her whole
body felt numb, like she wasn't feeling anything, at the same
time.</p>
<p>"And," her voice said, "if you want to break school rules or
something, you can ask me about it, I promise I won't just say
no."</p>

</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="76">Chapter 76</h2><h3>Interlude with the Confessor:
Sunk Costs</h3>
<p>Rianne Felthorne descended the stairs of roughened stone and
crude mortar, keeping a <i>Lumos</i> lit through the distances
between fire-sconces, holding aloft her wand through the gaps from
light to light.</p>
<p>She came to the empty rock cavern pierced by many dark openings,
lit by a torch of ancient style that fired as she entered.</p>
<p>There was no one else there, as yet, and after long minutes of
nervous standing, she began the spell to Transfigure a cushioned
sofa large enough for two people to sit, or maybe even lie down on.
A simple wooden stool would have been easier, she could have done
that in fifteen seconds, but - well -</p>
<p>Even when the sofa was fully conjured, Professor Snape still
hadn't arrived, and she sat down on the left side of her sofa with
her pulse hammering in her throat. Somehow she was only becoming
more nervous, not less, as the delay stretched.</p>
<p>She knew this was the last time.</p>
<p>The last time before all these memories went away, and Rianne
Felthorne found herself in a mysterious cavern, wondering what was
going on.</p>
<p>There was something about it that felt like dying.</p>
<p>The books said a properly done Obliviation wasn't harmful,
people forgot things all the time. People dreamed, and then woke up
without remembering their dreams. Obliviation didn't even involve
that much discontinuity, just a brief instant of disorientation; it
was like being distracted by a loud noise and losing track of a
thought you couldn't seem to remember afterward. That was what the
books said, and why Memory Charms were fully approved by the
Ministry for all authorized governmental purposes.</p>
<p>But still, <i>these thoughts,</i> the thoughts she was thinking
right now; soon nobody would have them anymore. When she looked
ahead in the future, there was nobody to complete the thoughts she
wasn't finished thinking. Even if she managed to tie up all the
loose ends in her mind over the next minute, there wouldn't be
anything left of it afterward. Wasn't that exactly what you would
find yourself reflecting on, if you were going to die in the next
minute?</p>
<p>There came the sound of muffled steps...</p>
<p>Severus Snape emerged into the cavern.</p>
<p>His eyes moved to her sitting on the sofa, and a strange
expression crossed his face; strange because it wasn't sardonic, or
angry, or cold.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Miss Felthorne," Snape said quietly, "that was
considerate of you." The Potions Master took out his wand and
performed the usual privacy Charms, and then he moved toward her,
and sat down heavily beside her on the Transfigured sofa.</p>
<p>Her pulse was now pounding for another reason entirely.</p>
<p>She slowly turned to look at Professor Snape, and saw that his
head was leaning back against the sofa, and his eyes were closed.
Not sleeping, though. His face appeared tense, unrelaxed, bearing
pain.</p>
<p>She knew - she was suddenly certain - that she was only allowed
to see this sight because she wouldn't remember it afterward; and
that nobody before her had ever been allowed to see it.</p>
<p>The frantic conversation going on inside Rianne Felthorne's mind
sounded something like this: <i>I could just lean over and kiss
him, you are completely out of your tiny mind, his eyes are closed
I bet he wouldn't stop me in time, I bet it would be years before
anyone found your body -</i></p>
<p>But Professor Snape opened his eyes then (to her inner
disappointment and relief), and said, in a more normal voice, "Your
payment, Miss Felthorne." From his robe he took a ruby, cut to
Gringotts standard, and held it out toward her. "Fifty facets. I
will not mind if you count them."</p>
<p>She held out a trembling hand, hoping that Snape would press the
ruby into her fingers, that she would feel a touch of his skin
alive against hers -</p>
<p>But instead Snape raised his hand slightly and dropped the ruby
into her hand, then leaned back against the couch. "You will
remember finding it lying on the ground of this cavern, where you
came exploring," said Snape. "And since nobody except you will
actually believe that, you will remember thinking that it would be
less troublesome if you deposited the money into a separate box in
Gringotts."</p>
<p>For a stretch there was only the faint crackling of the
torch.</p>
<p>"Why -" Rianne Felthorne said. <i>He knows I won't remember.</i>
"Why <i>did</i> you do it? I mean - you said to tell you where
bullies would be, and who they would be, but not whether Granger
would be there. And I know, the way the Time-Turner works, if you
want to <i>make</i> Granger be there, you can't be told whether
it's already happened. So I did work out that <i>we</i> were the
ones telling her where to go. We were, weren't we?"</p>
<p>Snape nodded without speaking. He had closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>"But," said Rianne, "I didn't understand <i>why</i> you were
helping her. And now - after what you did to Granger in the Great
Hall - I just don't understand at all." Rianne had never thought of
herself as particularly nice. She'd taken little notice of the
controversy over the Sunshine General. But something about
<i>helping</i> Granger fight bullies had... well, she'd gotten used
to thinking of that as the good side, and thinking of
<i>herself</i> as being on the good side. And she'd found she
actually liked it. It was hard, to just let that go. "Why'd you do
that, Professor Snape?"</p>
<p>Snape shook his head, his face tightened.</p>
<p>"Is -" Rianne said falteringly. "I mean - so long as we're here
- is there anything you do want to talk about?" There was something
<i>she</i> wanted to say, but she couldn't make the words pass her
own lips.</p>
<p>"I can think of one matter," Snape said after a pause. "If you
are interested, Miss Felthorne."</p>
<p>Snape's eyes were still shut, so she couldn't just nod her head.
Her voice almost broke, when she forced herself to say "Yes."</p>
<p>"There's a certain boy in your class who likes you, Miss
Felthorne," Snape said from behind his closed eyes. "I won't say
his name. But he watches you every time you walk across the room,
when he thinks you aren't looking. He dreams about you and desires
to possess you, but he's never asked you for so much as a
kiss."</p>
<p>Her heart started hammering even harder.</p>
<p>"Please tell me the honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What do you
think of that boy?"</p>
<p>"Well -" she said. She was stumbling over her words. "I think -
to never even ask for one kiss - would be -"</p>
<p><i>Sad.</i></p>
<p><i>Just too p</i><i>itiful.</i></p>
<p>"Weakness," she said, her voice trembling.</p>
<p>"I agree," said Snape. "Suppose that boy had helped you, though.
Would you think that you owed him a kiss, if he asked?"</p>
<p>She inhaled sharply -</p>
<p>"Or would you think," Snape continued, his eyes still closed,
"that he was just being bothersome?"</p>
<p>The words stabbed into her like a knife and she couldn't help
gasping out loud.</p>
<p>Snape's eyes flew open, and his gaze met hers across the
sofa.</p>
<p>Then the Potions Master began to laugh, small sad chuckles.</p>
<p>"No, not <i>you,</i> Miss Felthorne!" Snape said. "Not
<i>you!</i> We really <i>are</i> talking about a boy. One who
attends your Potions class, in fact."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said. She tried to remember what Snape had said
before, now feeling rather unnerved as she thought of some boy
watching her, always silently watching. "Well, um, in that case.
That's kind of <i>creepy</i>, actually. Who is it?"</p>
<p>The Potions Master shook his head. "It doesn't matter," said
Snape. "Out of curiosity, what would you think if that boy were
still in love with you years later?"</p>
<p>"Um," she said, feeling a bit confused, "that would be totally
pathetic?"</p>
<p>The torch crackled a bit in the cavern.</p>
<p>"It's strange," Snape said quietly. "I have had two mentors,
over the course of my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive,
and neither one ever told me the things I wasn't seeing. It's clear
enough why the first said nothing, but the second..." Snape's face
tightened. "I suppose I would have to be naive, to ask why he
stayed silent."</p>
<p>The quiet stretched, while Rianne tried frantically to think of
something to say.</p>
<p>"It is an odd thing," Snape said, his voice still softer, "to
look back after only thirty-two years, and wonder when your life
was ruined past all rescuing. Was it determined when the Sorting
Hat cried 'Slytherin!' for me? It seems unfair, since I was offered
no choice; the Sorting Hat spoke the moment it touched upon my
head. Yet I cannot claim it named me untruly. I never treasured
knowledge for its own sake. I was not loyal to the one person I
called friend. I was never one for righteous fury, then or now.
Courage? There is no bravery in risking a life already ruined. My
little fears have always mastered me, and I never turned aside from
any of the paths I walked down, for those little fears. No, the
Sorting Hat could never have put me in her House. Perhaps my final
loss was determined, even then. Is that fair, I ask, even if the
Sorting Hat speaks truly? Is it fair that some children should
possess more courage than others, and thus a man's life be
judged?"</p>
<p>Rianne Felthorne was starting to realize that she'd never had
the tiniest inkling of who her Potions Master was inside, and
unfortunately all these dark hidden depths weren't helping her with
her problem.</p>
<p>"But no," Snape said. "I know where it went wrong for the last
time. I could point to the very day and hour I missed my final
chance. Miss Felthorne, did the Sorting Hat offer you
Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes," she said without thinking.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been any good at riddles?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said again, because whatever Professor Snape was
about to say, she wouldn't hear it if she said <i>no.</i></p>
<p>"I am terrible at riddles," Snape said in a distant voice. "I
was once given a riddle to solve, and I did not understand even the
simplest part until too late. I did not even realize the riddle was
meant for <i>me</i> until too late. I thought I had merely happened
to overhear it, when in truth it was I who was overheard. So I sold
my riddle to another, and that is when the wreckage of my life
passed beyond retrieval." Snape's voice was still distant, sounding
more abstracted than sorrowful. "And even now, I understand nothing
of importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose a man were carrying
a knife, and he tripped over a baby and stabbed himself. Would you
say that the baby had," Snape's voice lowered, as though he were
imitating some still deeper voice, "<i>THE POWER TO VANQUISH</i>
him?"</p>
<p>"Um... no?" she said hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Then what <i>does</i> it mean to have the power to vanquish
someone?"</p>
<p>Rianne considered the puzzle. (Wishing, not for the first time
in her life, that she had chosen Ravenclaw and to perdition with
her parents' disapproval; but the Sorting Hat had never offered her
Gryffindor.) "Well..." Rianne said. She was having trouble putting
her thoughts into words. "It means you've got the <i>power</i>, but
you don't <i>have</i> to do it. It means you could do it if you
tried -"</p>
<p>"Choice," the Potions Master said in the same faraway voice, as
though he wasn't really talking to her at all. "There will be a
choice. That is what the riddle seems to imply. And that choice is
not a foregone conclusion to the chooser, for the riddle does not
say, <i>will vanquish,</i> but rather <i>the power to vanquish.</i>
How would a grown man mark a baby as his equal?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Rianne. She didn't understand that at all.</p>
<p>"<i>Marking</i> a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would
produce a lasting scar. But such may be done to any child. What
mark would signify that a baby was your <i>equal?</i>"</p>
<p>She answered with the first thought that came to mind. "If you
signed a betrothal contract, that would mean you'd be equals with
them someday, when they grew up and you got married."</p>
<p>"That..." said Snape. "That's probably not it, Miss Felthorne,
but thank you for trying." The long delicate fingers, honed by
stirring potions to unimaginably fine tolerances, reached up and
rubbed at the temples of the man's forehead. "It is enough to drive
me to madness, so much hinging on such fragile words. Power he
knows not... it <i>must</i> be more than some unknown spell. Not
something <i>he</i> could acquire simply by practice and study.
Some innate talent? No one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus... and
yet that hardly seems like a power he <i>knows not</i>. Nor can I
see how <i>either</i> could destroy all but a remnant of the other;
I can see it in one direction, but not the reverse..." The Potions
Master sighed. "And none of this means anything to you, does it,
Miss Felthorne? The words are nothing. The words are shadows. It is
her <i>intonation</i> which carries the meaning and that is
something I've never been able to..."</p>
<p>The Potions Master trailed off, while Rianne stared at him.</p>
<p>"A <i>prophecy?</i>" Rianne said in a high squeak. "You heard a
<i>prophecy?</i>" She'd taken Divination for a couple of months
before dropping it in disgust, and she knew that much about how it
worked.</p>
<p>"I will try one last thing," said Snape. "Something I have not
tried before. Miss Felthorne, listen to the <i>sound</i> of my
voice, the <i>way</i> I say it<i>,</i> not the words themselves,
and tell me what you think it means. Can you do that? Good," said
Snape, as she nodded obediently, though she wasn't sure at all what
she was supposed to do.</p>
<p>And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, "<i>FOR THOSE TWO
DIFFERENT SPELLETS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME VULD.</i>"</p>
<p>It sent shivers down her spine, all the worse for knowing the
hollow words had been spoken in imitation of a true prophecy.
Unnerved, she blurted out the first thing which came to mind, which
might have been influenced by her present company. "Those two
different ingredients cannot exist in the same cauldron?"</p>
<p>"But why <i>not</i>, Miss Felthorne? What is the <i>meaning</i>
of a statement like that? What are we really being told?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." she hazarded. "If the two ingredients mix, they'll catch
fire and burn the cauldron?"</p>
<p>Snape's face did not change expression in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Snape finally said, after they'd sat on the sofa in
awful silence for what seemed like minutes. "It would explain the
word <i>must</i>. Thank you, Miss Felthorne. Once again you have
been most helpful."</p>
<p>"I -" she said, "I was glad to -" and the words stuck in her
throat. The Potions Master had thanked her with a tone of finality,
and she knew that the time of the Rianne Felthorne who remembered
these moments was drawing to an end. "I wish I didn't have to
forget this, Professor Snape!"</p>
<p>"I wish," Severus Snape said in a whisper so low she could
hardly hear it, "that everything had been different..."</p>
<p>The Potions Master stood up from the sofa, the weight of his
presence vanishing from beside her. He turned and drew his wand
from his robes, pointing it at her.</p>
<p>"Wait -" she said. "Before that -"</p>
<p>Somehow it was unbelievably hard to take the first step from
fantasy to reality, from imagining to doing. Even if it was only
one step and would never go any further. The gap stretched like the
distance between two mountains.</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor...</p>
<p>...was it fair that thus a woman's life be judged?</p>
<p><i>If you can't</i> <i>say it now, when you won't even remember
it afterward - when nothing will continue from this moment, just as
if you were to die - then when will you ever say it, to
anyone?</i></p>
<p>"Can I have a kiss first?" said Rianne Felthorne.</p>
<p>Snape's black eyes studied her so intensely that her blush
started to reach all the way to her chest, and she wondered if he
knew perfectly well that she was still being weak, and it wasn't a
kiss she'd truly wanted.</p>
<p>"Why not," the Potions Master said quietly, and he leaned his
head down over the sofa and kissed her.</p>
<p>It was nothing like she'd imagined. In her fantasies Snape's
kisses were fierce, seized from her, but this was - it was just
<i>awkward,</i> actually. Snape's lips pressed down too hard on
hers, forcing them back against her teeth, and the angle wasn't
right and their noses were sort of bending and his lips were too
<i>tight</i> and -</p>
<p>Only as the Potions Master straightened back up again, raising
his wand once more, did she realize.</p>
<p>"That wasn't -" she said in a wondering voice, looking up at
him. "That wasn't - was it - your <i>first</i> -"</p>
<p>Rianne Felthorne blinked at the stone cavern she'd discovered,
still holding the extraordinary ruby she'd found embedded in the
dirt of one corner. It was an incredible windfall, and she didn't
know why looking at the ruby made her feel so sad, like she'd
forgotten something, something that had been precious to her.</p>

Appearances</h3>
<p><i>Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore and -</i></p>
<p>The old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the
Headmaster's office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices;
his robes a gentle yellow, of soft fabric, not such clothing as he
ordinarily wore before others. His wrinkled hand held a quill
scratching away at an official-looking parchment. If you had
somehow been there to watch his lined face, you would have been
unable to deduce anything more about the man himself than you
understood of the enigmatic devices. You might have observed that
the face looked a little sad, a little tired, but then Albus
Dumbledore always looked like that when he was alone.</p>
<p>In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes without a
hint of flame, a magical door that had been shut so solidly as to
stop existing. On the material plane, the great oaken door to the
office had been closed and locked; beyond that door, the Endless
Stairs stayed motionless; at the bottom of those stairs, the
gargoyles that blocked the entrance did not flow, their pseudo-life
withdrawn to leave solid rock.</p>
<p>Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word,
even as it was in the middle of scratching a letter -</p>
<p>The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have
shocked anyone watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall
onto the parchment; like lightning he spun on the oaken door, his
yellow robes whirling around him and a wand of dread power leaping
into his hand -</p>
<p>And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even
as the wand came to bear.</p>
<p>A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking.</p>
<p>More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the dueling
holster strapped beneath the old wizard's sleeve. The ancient man
moved forward a few paces, drew himself up into a more formal
stance, composed his face. Nearby upon the desk, the quill moved to
the side of the parchment, as though it had been carefully placed
there rather than dropped in haste; and the parchment itself
flipped over to show blankness.</p>
<p>With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open.</p>
<p>Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him.</p>
<p>"I admit that I am impressed, Harry," the old wizard said
quietly. "The Cloak of Invisibility would have let you evade my
lesser means of vision; but I did not sense my golems step aside,
nor the stairs turning. How did you come here?"</p>
<p>The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until
the door closed smoothly behind him. "I can go anywhere I choose,
with or without permission," that boy said. His voice seemed calm;
too calm, perhaps. "I am in your office because I decided to be
here, and to hell with passwords. You are greatly mistaken,
Headmaster Dumbledore, if you think that I stay in this school
because I am a prisoner here. I simply have not chosen, <i>yet</i>,
to leave. Now keeping that in mind, why did you command your agent,
Professor Snape, to break the agreement we made in this office,
that he would not torment any student in her fourth year or
below?"</p>
<p>The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment.
Then, slowly enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers
drew open one of the manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a
sheet of parchment, laid it upon the desk. "Fourteen," the old
wizard said. "It is not the number of all the owls sent last night.
Only the owls sent to families with a seat on the Wizengamot, or
families of great wealth, or families already allied with your
foes. Or, in the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for his father,
Lord Jugson, is a Death Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eater
who died by Alastor Moody's wand. What the letters said, I do not
know, but I can guess. Do you <i>still</i> not understand, Harry
Potter? Each time Hermione Granger <i>won</i>, as you put it, the
danger to her from Slytherin grew again, and yet again. But now the
Slytherins have triumphed over her, easily and safely, without
violence or lasting harm. They have won, and need fight no more..."
The old wizard sighed. "So I had planned. So I had hoped. So it
would have been, if the Defense Professor had not taken it upon
himself to intervene. Now the dispute goes to the Board of
Governors, where Severus will seem to conquer the Defense
Professor; but that will not feel the same to the Slytherins, it
will not have been over and finished in a moment, to their
satisfaction."</p>
<p>The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back
further to look up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was
like the boy was looking down at the Headmaster, rather than up.
"So this Lord Jugson is a Death Eater?" the boy said softly. "Good.
His life is already bought and paid for, then, and I can do
anything I want to him without ethical problems -"</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>"</p>
<p>The boy's voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from
some untouched spring. "You seem to think that the Light should
live in fear of the darkness. I say it should be the other way
around. I'd prefer not to kill this Lord Jugson, even if he is a
Death Eater. But one hour of brainstorming with the Defense
Professor would be plenty of time to come up with some creative way
to wreck him financially, or get him exiled from magical Britain.
That would serve to make the point, I think."</p>
<p>"I confess," the old wizard said slowly, "that the thought of
ruining a five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death
Eater to war to the finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway,
had not occurred to me, Harry." The old wizard lifted a finger to
push back his half-moon glasses from where they had slid a little
down his nose, during his sudden motion earlier. "I daresay it
would not occur to Miss Granger either, nor to Professor
McGonagall, nor to Fred and George."</p>
<p>The boy shrugged. "It wouldn't <i>be</i> about the hallways,"
the boy said. "It would be justice for his past crimes, and I'd
only do it if Jugson made the first move. The point isn't to make
people scared of me as a wild card, after all. It's to teach them
that neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and poking me with a
stick is incredibly dangerous." The boy smiled in a way that didn't
reach his eyes. "Maybe I'll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, saying
that anyone who wants to carry on this dispute with me will learn
the true meaning of Chaos, but anyone who leaves me alone will be
fine."</p>
<p>"<i>No</i>," the old wizard said. His voice was deeper now,
showing something of his true age and power. "No, Harry, that must
not be. You have not yet learned the meaning of fighting, what
truly happens when foes meet in battle. And so you dream, as young
boys do, of teaching your foes to fear you. It frightens me that
you, at far too young an age, might already have enough power to
make some part of your dreams into reality. There is <i>no</i>
turning of that road which does not lead into darkness, Harry,
none. That is the way of a Dark Lord, for certain."</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty
golden platform where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings. It was a
gesture that few would have caught, but the old wizard knew it very
well.</p>
<p>"All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me," the
boy said then. His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had
gone from it. "I still don't think you should let children get hurt
out of fear of what someone like Lord Jugson <i>might</i> do.
Protecting them is the whole point of your job. If Lord Jugson
really does try to get in your way, then do whatever it takes to
stop him. Give me full access to my vaults, and <i>I'll</i> take
personal responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning
bullies in Hogwarts, whether it's Lord Jugson or anyone else."</p>
<p>Slowly the old wizard shook his head. "You seem to think, Harry,
that I need merely use my full power, and all foes will be swept
aside. You are wrong. Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge,
through the <i>Daily Prophet</i> he sways all Britain, only by bare
margins does he not control enough of the Board of Governors to
oust me from Hogwarts. Amelia Bones and Bartemius Crouch are
allies, but even they would step aside if they saw us acting
wantonly. The world that surrounds you is more fragile than you
seem to believe, and we must walk with greater care. The old
Wizarding War never ended, Harry, it only continued in a different
form; the black king slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved his chesspieces
for a time. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you to
take a pawn of his color?"</p>
<p>The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again. "Okay, I'll
figure out some way to set it up so that it looks like Lord Jugson
betrayed his own side."</p>
<p>"Harry -"</p>
<p>"Obstacles mean you <i>get creative</i>, Headmaster. It doesn't
mean you abandon the children you're supposed to protect. Let the
Light win, and if trouble comes of it -" The boy shrugged. "Let
Light win again."</p>
<p>"So might phoenixes speak, if they had words," the old wizard
said. "But you do not understand the <i>phoenix's price.</i>"</p>
<p>The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that
seemed to echo around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise
seemed to come from all around them.</p>
<p>Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat's
hatrack, the stone of the walls began to flow and move, pouring
itself into two framing columns and revealing a gap between them,
an opening that showed a set of stone stairs leading upward into
darkness.</p>
<p>The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and then
looked back at where Harry Potter stood. "Come!" said the old
wizard. There was no twinkle now in those blue eyes. "Since you
have already gone so far as to force your way here uninvited, you
may as well go further."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>There were no railings on those stone steps, and after the first
few steps Harry drew his wand and cast <i>Lumos.</i> The Headmaster
did not look back, did not seem to be looking downward, as though
he had climbed the steps often enough to have no need of
vision.</p>
<p>The boy knew that he should have been curious, or frightened,
but there was no spare brain capacity for that. It was taking all
his control not to let the fury simmering inside him boil over any
further than it already had.</p>
<p>The stairs went on for only a short distance, one straight
rising flight without turns or curves.</p>
<p>At the top was a door of solid metal, looking black in the blue
light cast from Harry's wand, meaning that the metal itself was
either black or perhaps red.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore lifted up his long wand like a brandished
symbol, and again spoke in that strange voice which seemed to echo
in Harry's ears, as though burning itself into his memory:
"<i>Phoenix's fate.</i>"</p>
<p>That last door opened, and Harry followed Dumbledore inside.</p>
<p>The room beyond seemed to be made of black metal like the door
that led to it. The walls were black, the floor was black. The
ceiling above was black, but for a single globe of crystal that
hung down from the ceiling on a white chain, and shone with a
brilliant silver light that looked like it had been cast in
imitation of Patronus light, though you could tell it wasn't the
real thing.</p>
<p>Within the room were pedestals of black metal, each bearing a
moving picture, or an upright cylinder half-filled with some
faintly shining silver liquid, or a lone small object; a scorched
silver necklace, a crushed hat, an untouched golden wedding ring.
Many pedestals bore all three, the moving picture and the silver
liquid and the item. There seemed to be a good many wizards' wands
upon those pedestals, and many of those wands were broken, or
burned, or looked like the wood had somehow melted.</p>
<p>It took that long for Harry to realize what he was seeing, and
then his throat suddenly choked; it was like the rage inside him
had been hit a hammerblow, maybe the hardest hammerblow of his
entire existence.</p>
<p>"These are not all the fallen of all my wars," Albus Dumbledore
said. His back was to Harry, only his grey locks and yellowish
robes showed. "Not even nearly all of them. Only my closest
friends, and those who died of my worst decisions, there is
something of them here. Those I regret most of all, this is their
place."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't count how many pedestals were in the room. It
might have been around a hundred. The room of black metal was not
small, and there was clearly more space left in it for future
pedestals.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore turned and regarded Harry, the deep blue eyes
set like steel in his brow, but his voice, when he spoke, was calm.
"It seems to me that you know nothing of the phoenix's price,"
Albus Dumbledore said quietly. "It seems to me that you are not an
evil person, but most terribly ignorant, and confident in your
ignorance; as I once was, a long time ago. Yet I have never heard
Fawkes so clearly as you seemed to, that day. Perhaps I was already
too old and full of grief, when my phoenix came to me. If there is
something I do not understand, about how ready I should be to
fight, then tell me of this wisdom." There was no anger in the old
wizard's voice; the impact that drove out your breath like falling
off a broomstick was all in the scorched and shattered wands,
gleaming gently in their death beneath the silver light. "Or else
turn and go from this place, but then I wish to hear no more of
it."</p>
<p>Harry didn't know what to say. There had been nothing in his own
life that was like this, and all the words seemed to fall away. He
would find something to say if he looked, but he couldn't believe,
in that moment, that the words would be meaningful. You shouldn't
be able to win any possible argument, just from people having died
of your decisions, and yet even knowing that it felt like there was
nothing to be said. That there was nothing Harry had any right to
say.</p>
<p>And Harry almost did turn and go from that place, except for the
understanding which came to him then: that there was probably a
part of Albus Dumbledore which always stood in this place, always,
no matter where he was. And that if you stood in a place like this
you could do anything, <i>lose</i> anything, if it meant that you
didn't have to fight another time.</p>
<p>One of the pedestals caught Harry's eye; the photograph on it
did not move, did not smile or wave, it was a Muggle photograph of
a woman looking seriously at the camera, her brown hair twisted
into braids of an ordinary Muggle style that Harry hadn't seen on
any witch. There was a cylinder of silvery liquid beside the
photograph, but no object; no melted ring or broken wand.</p>
<p>Harry walked forward, slowly, until he stood before the
pedestal. "Who was she?" Harry said, his voice sounding strange in
his own ears.</p>
<p>"Her name was Tricia Glasswell," said Dumbledore. "The mother of
a Muggleborn daughter, who the Death Eaters killed. She was a
detective of the Muggle government, and after that she fed
information from the Muggle authorities to the Order of the
Phoenix, until she was - betrayed - into the hands of Voldemort."
There was a catch in the old wizard's voice. "She did not die well,
Harry."</p>
<p>"Did she save lives?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yes," the wizard said quietly. "She did."</p>
<p>Harry lifted his gaze from the pedestal to look at Dumbledore.
"Would the world be a better place if she hadn't fought?"</p>
<p>"No, it would not," said the old wizard. His voice was tired,
and grieving. He seemed more bent now, as though he were folding in
on himself. "I see that you still do not understand. I think you
will not understand until the day that you - oh, Harry. So very
long ago, when I was not much older than you are now, I learned the
true face of violence, and its cost. To fill the air with deadly
curses - for any reason - for <i>any</i> reason, Harry - it is an
ill thing, and its nature is corrupted, as terrible as the darkest
rituals. Violence, once begun, becomes like a Lethifold that
strikes at any life near it. I... would spare you that lesson the
way I learned it, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry looked away from the blue eyes, cast his gaze down at the
black metal of the floor. The Headmaster was trying to tell him
something important, that was clear; and it wasn't something that
Harry thought was stupid, either.</p>
<p>"There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi," Harry said to
the floor. "He thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn't
rule over his country. And he refused to fight. He convinced his
whole country not to fight. Instead he told his people to walk up
to the British soldiers and let themselves be struck down, without
resisting, and when Britain couldn't stand doing that any more, we
freed his country. I thought it was a very beautiful thing, when I
read about it, I thought it was something higher than all the wars
that anyone had ever fought with guns or swords. That they'd really
done that, and that it had <i>actually worked.</i>" Harry drew
another breath. "Only then I found out that Gandhi told his people,
during World War II, that if the Nazis invaded they should use
nonviolent resistance against them, too. But the Nazis would've
just shot everyone in sight. And maybe Winston Churchill always
felt that there should've been a better way, some clever way to win
without having to hurt anyone; but he never found it, and so he had
to fight." Harry looked up at the Headmaster, who was staring at
him. "Winston Churchill was the one who tried to convince the
British government <i>not</i> to give Czechoslovakia to Hitler in
exchange for a peace treaty, that they should fight right away
-"</p>
<p>"I recognize the name, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard's
lips twitched upward. "Although honesty compels me to say that dear
Winston was never one for pangs of conscience, even after a dozen
shots of Firewhiskey."</p>
<p>"The point is," Harry said, after a brief pause to remember
exactly who he was talking to, and fight down the suddenly
returning sense that he was an ignorant child gone insane with
audacity who had no right to be in this room and no right to
question Albus Dumbledore about anything, "the point is, saying
violence is evil isn't an <i>answer.</i> It doesn't say when to
fight and when not to fight. It's a hard question and Gandhi
refused to deal with it, and that's why I lost some of my respect
for him."</p>
<p>"And your own answer, Harry?" Dumbledore said quietly.</p>
<p>"One answer is that you shouldn't ever use violence except to
stop violence," Harry said. "You shouldn't risk anyone's life
except to save even more lives. It <i>sounds</i> good when you say
it like that. Only the problem is that if a police officer sees a
burglar robbing a house, the police officer <i>should</i> try to
stop the burglar, even though the burglar might fight back and
someone might get hurt or even killed. Even if the burglar is only
trying to steal jewelry, which is just a <i>thing.</i> Because if
nobody so much as <i>inconveniences</i> burglars, there will be
<i>more</i> burglars, and <i>more</i> burglars. And even if they
only ever stole <i>things</i> each time, it would - the fabric of
society -" Harry stopped. His thoughts weren't as ordered as they
usually pretended to be, in this room. He should have been able to
give some perfectly logical exposition in terms of game theory,
should have at least been able to <i>see</i> it that way, but it
was eluding him. Hawks and doves - "Don't you see, if evil people
are willing to risk violence to get what they want, and good people
always back down because violence is too terrible to risk, it's -
it's not a good society to live in, Headmaster! Don't you realize
what all this bullying is doing to Hogwarts, to Slytherin House
most of all?"</p>
<p>"<i>War</i> is too terrible to risk," the old wizard said. "And
yet it will come. Voldemort is returning. The black chesspieces are
gathering. Severus is one of the most important pieces our own side
possesses, in that war. But our evil Potions Master must, as the
saying goes, keep up appearances. If Severus can pay that keep by
hurting the feelings of children, only their feelings, Harry," the
old wizard's voice was very soft, "you would have to be most
terribly innocent in the ways of war, to think he had made a poor
bargain. Hard decisions do not look like <i>that</i>, Harry. They
look - like this." The old wizard did not gesture. He simply stood
where he was, among the pedestals.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be Headmaster," Harry said through the burning in
his throat. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't try to be a
school principal and run a war at the same time. Hogwarts shouldn't
be part of this."</p>
<p>"The children will survive," the old wizard said with tired old
eyes. "They would not survive Voldemort. Have you wondered why the
children of Hogwarts do not speak much of their parents, Harry? It
is because there is always, within earshot, someone who has lost
their mother or father or both. That is what Voldemort left behind,
the last time he came. <i>Nothing</i> is worth that war beginning
again even one day earlier than it must, or lasting one day longer
than it must." The old wizard did gesture now, as though to
indicate all the shattered wands. "We did not fight because it
seemed righteous to do so! We fought when we had to, when there was
no other way left. That was our answer."</p>
<p>"Is that why you waited so long to confront Grindelwald?"</p>
<p>Harry had uttered the question without quite thinking -</p>
<p>There was a slow time while the blue eyes searched him.</p>
<p>"Who have you been talking to, Harry?" said the old wizard. "No,
do not answer. I already know." Dumbledore sighed. "Many have asked
me that question, and always I have turned them aside. Yet in time
you must learn the full truth of that matter. Will you swear never
to speak of it to another, until I give you leave?"</p>
<p>Harry would have liked to be allowed to tell Draco, but - "I
swear," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Grindelwald possessed an ancient and terrible device," said
Dumbledore. "While he held it, I could not break his defense. In
our duel I could not win, only fight him for long hours until he
fell in exhaustion; and I would have died of it afterward, if not
for Fawkes. But while his Muggle allies yet made blood sacrifice to
sustain him, Grindelwald would <i>not</i> have fallen. He was,
during that time, truly invincible. Of that grim device which
Grindelwald held, none must know, none must suspect, there must be
not a single hint. And therefore you must not speak of it, and I
will say no more for now. That is all, Harry. There is no moral to
it, and no wisdom. That is all there is."</p>
<p>Harry slowly nodded. It wasn't entirely implausible, by the
standards of magic...</p>
<p>"And then," Dumbledore's voice went on, even quieter, almost as
though he were speaking to himself, "since it was I who felled him,
they obeyed me when I said he should not die, though they cried by
the thousands for his blood. So he was imprisoned in Nurmengard, in
the prison that he built, and he abides there until this day. I
went to that duel without any intent to kill him, Harry. Because,
you see, I had tried to kill Grindelwald once before, a long time
ago, and that... that was... it proved to be... a mistake,
Harry..." The old wizard was staring now at his long dark-grey wand
where he held it in both hands, as though it were a crystal ball
out of Muggle fantasy, a scrying pool within which answers could be
found. "And I thought, then... I thought that I should never kill.
And then came Voldemort."</p>
<p>The old wizard looked back up at Harry, and said, in a hoarse
voice, "He is not like Grindelwald, Harry. There is nothing human
left in him. <i>Him</i> you must destroy. You must not hesitate,
when the time comes. To him alone, of all the creatures in this
world, you must show no mercy; and when you are done you must
forget it, forget that you ever did such a thing, and go back to
living. Save your fury for that, and that alone."</p>
<p>In that office there was silence.</p>
<p>It lasted for some many long seconds, and finally was broken by
a single question.</p>
<p>"Are there Dementors in Nurmengard?"</p>
<p>"What?" said the old wizard. "No! I would not have done that
even to him -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened,
and his face changed.</p>
<p>"In other words," the boy said, as though talking to himself
without any other people in the room, "it's already known how to
keep powerful Dark Wizards in prison, without using Dementors.
People <i>know</i> they know that."</p>
<p>"Harry...?"</p>
<p>"No," the boy said. The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing
like green fire. "I do not accept your answer, Headmaster. Fawkes
gave me a mission, and I know now why Fawkes gave that mission to
me, and not to you. You are willing to accept balances of power
where the bad guys end up winning. I am not."</p>
<p>"That too is not an answer," the old wizard said; his face
showed nothing of his hurt, he had long practice in concealing
pain. "Refusing to accept something does not change it. I wonder
now if you are simply too young to understand this matter, Harry,
despite your outward airs; only in children's fantasies can all
battles be won, and not a single evil tolerated."</p>
<p>"And that's why I can destroy Dementors and you can't," said the
boy. "Because I believe that the darkness can be broken."</p>
<p>The old wizard's breath stopped in his throat.</p>
<p>"The phoenix's price isn't inevitable," the boy said. "It's not
part of some deep balance built into the universe. It's just the
parts of the problem where you haven't figured out yet how to
cheat."</p>
<p>The old wizard's lips parted, and no words came forth.</p>
<p>Silver light falling on shattered wands.</p>
<p>"Fawkes gave me a mission," the boy repeated, "and I will carry
out that mission if I must break the entire Ministry to do it.
That's the part of the answer that you're missing. You don't stop
and say, <i>oh well, guess I can't possibly figure out any way to
stop bullying in Hogwarts,</i> and <i>leave</i> it at that. You
just keep looking until you figure out how to do it. If that
requires breaking Lucius Malfoy's entire conspiracy,
<i>fine.</i>"</p>
<p>"And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?" the old
wizard said in an unsteady voice. "What will you do to win
<i>that</i>, Harry? Will you break the whole world? Even if someday
you gain such power, you are not yet beyond prices, and perhaps you
never will be! For you to act this way <i>now</i> is nothing short
of madness!"</p>
<p>"I asked Professor Quirrell why he'd laughed," the boy said
evenly, "after he awarded Hermione those hundred points. And
Professor Quirrell said, these aren't his exact words, but it's
pretty much what he said, that he'd found it tremendously amusing
that the great and good Albus Dumbledore had been sitting there
doing nothing as this poor innocent girl begged for help, while
<i>he</i> had been the one to defend her. And he told me then that
by the time good and moral people were done tying themselves up in
knots, what they usually did was nothing; or, if they did act, you
could hardly tell them apart from the people called bad. Whereas
<i>he</i> could help innocent girls any time he felt like it,
because he wasn't a good person. And that I ought to remember that,
any time I considered growing up to be good."</p>
<p>The old wizard did not show the force of the blow. Only a slight
widening of his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been
watching him very closely.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Headmaster," said the boy. "I haven't gotten my
wires crossed. I know that I'm supposed to learn goodness from
Hermione and Fawkes, not from Professor Quirrell and you. Which
brings me to the actual reason why I came here. Hermione's time is
too valuable to waste in detentions. Professor Snape will revoke
it, claiming that I blackmailed him."</p>
<p>After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver
beard swaying slowly beneath. "That would not be best for
<i>her,</i> Harry," the old wizard said. "But the detention can be
put down as being served with Professor Binns, and you and she can
study together in his classroom."</p>
<p>"Fine," the boy said. "I think that was all the business we had
together, in the end. You may expect, the next time you seem to be
working on the side of the bad guys or letting them win, that I
will do whatever I think Fawkes would tell me to, regardless of how
much trouble comes of it. I hope we're both clear on that."</p>
<p>Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room,
through the open door of black metal, the words "<i>Lumos!</i>"
and the light of his wand following a moment later.</p>
<p>The old wizard stood there silent, silent amid the ruins of the
lives which his own life had left behind. His wrinkled hand rose,
shaking, to touch at his half-moon glasses -</p>
<p>The boy poked his head back in. "Would you mind switching on the
stairs, Headmaster? I'd rather not go through all the work again to
leave the same way I came."</p>
<p>"Go, Harry Potter," the old wizard said. "The stairs will
receive you."</p>
<p>(Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisibly
waited next to the gargoyles since 9PM, followed the Deputy
Headmistress through the opening that parted for her, stood quietly
behind her on the turning stairs until they came to the top, and
then, still under the Cloak, spun his Time-Turner thrice.)</p>

<p><i>Aftermath: Professor Quirrell and -</i></p>
<p>In a shadowy clearing the Defense Professor waited, his back
leaned negligently against the rough grey bark of a towering beech
tree as yet unleaved in the late March days, so that its trunk and
crown seemed like a pale arm reaching up from the ground and
exploding into a hand of a thousand fingers. Around the Defense
Professor and above him were branches so dense that even in the
earliest spring, with few trees so much as budding, you could have
hardly seen the sky from the ground. The strands of the wooden net
crossed and proliferated so many times that if you were on a
broomstick above, searching for someone below, you would have found
it easier to follow your ears than your eyes. Nor would it have
helped that it was almost dark amid the prohibited woods, the
unseen sun almost set, so that only a few glows of fading sunlight
illuminated the tops of the tallest trees.</p>
<p>Then came the faintest sound of footsteps, almost inaudible even
on the forest ground; the gait of a man accustomed to passing
unseen. No twig snapped, nor leaf rustled -</p>
<p>"Good afternoon," said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor
did not trouble to move his eyes, or his hands from where they
rested negligently at his side.</p>
<p>A figure clad in a black cloak shimmered into existence, his
head turning to look left and then right. In the figure's right
hand, gripped low, was a wand of wood so grey it was almost
silver.</p>
<p>"I do not know why you wished to meet <i>here</i> of all
places," said Severus Snape, his voice cool.</p>
<p>"Oh," Professor Quirrell said idly, as though the whole matter
was of the least importance, "I thought you would prefer privacy.
The walls of Hogwarts have ears, and you would not wish the
Headmaster to know of your role in yesterday's affair, would
you?"</p>
<p>The March chill seemed to grow deeper, the temperature further
fall. "I don't know what you're talking about," the Potions Master
said icily.</p>
<p>"You know perfectly well what we're talking about," said
Professor Quirrell in an amused voice. "Really, my good Professor,
you should not meddle in the affairs of idiots unless you are ready
to defend yourself upon the instant from all their violence." (The
Defense Professor's hands still lay relaxed and open at his side.)
"And yet none of those idiots seem to remember the sight of you
falling, nor do the young ladies recall your presence. Which raises
the fascinating question of why you would go to the extraordinary
length, I dare say the <i>desperate</i> length, of casting
<i>fifty-two</i> Memory Charms." Professor Quirrell tilted his
head. "Would you fear so much the opinions of mere students? I
think not. Would you dread the matter becoming known to your good
friend, Lord Malfoy? But those fools, upon the very spot, invented
a quite satisfactory excuse for your presence. No, there is only
one person who holds so much power over you, and who would be most
perturbed to find you executing any plot without his knowledge.
Your true and hidden master, Albus Dumbledore."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" hissed the Potions Master, the anger plain upon
his face.</p>
<p>"But now, it seems, you are moving on your own; and so I find
myself most intrigued as to what you could <i>possibly</i> be
doing, and why." The Defense Professor regarded the black-clad
silhouette of the Potions Master with the scrutiny a man might give
an exceptionally interesting bug, even if it was still ultimately
just a bug.</p>
<p>"I am no servant of Dumbledore's," the Potions Master said
coldly.</p>
<p>"Really? What astonishing news." The Defense Professor smiled
slightly. "Do tell me all about it."</p>
<p>There was a long pause. From some tree an owl hooted, the sound
huge in the silence; neither man startled or flinched.</p>
<p>"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," Severus Snape said,
his voice very soft.</p>
<p>"I don't?" said Professor Quirrell. "How would you know?"</p>
<p>"On the other hand," the Potions Master continued, voice still
soft, "my friends enjoy many advantages."</p>
<p>The man leaning against the grey bark raised his eyebrows. "Such
as?"</p>
<p>"There is much that I know of this school," said the Potions
Master. "Things you might not think I knew."</p>
<p>There was an expectant pause.</p>
<p>"How incredibly fascinating," said Professor Quirrell. The man
was examining his fingernails with a bored look. "Do go on."</p>
<p>"I know you have been... <i>investigating...</i> the third-floor
corridor -"</p>
<p>"You know nothing of the sort." The man's back straightened
against the wood. "Do not bluff against me, Severus Snape; I find
it annoying, and you are in no position to annoy me. A single
glance would tell any competent wizard that the Headmaster has
laced that corridor with a ridiculous quantity of wards and webs,
triggers and tripsigns. And more: there are Charms laid there of
ancient power, magical constructs of which I have heard not even
rumors, techniques that must have been disgorged from the hoarded
lore of Flamel himself. Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would have
had trouble passing those without notice." Professor Quirrell
tapped a thoughtful finger on his cheek. "And for the actual lock,
a <i>Colloportus</i> laid on an ordinary doorknob, cast so weakly
that it could not have kept out Miss Granger on the day she entered
Hogwarts. Never before in my existence have I encountered such a
blatant trap." Now the Defense Professor narrowed his eyes. "I know
of no one left in the world against whom such fantastic feats of
detection would serve any useful purpose. If there is some wizard
possessed of ancient lore, of whom I know nothing, against whom
this trap is set - you may trade <i>that</i> information for as
much silence as you like, my dear Professor, and a good serving of
my favor left over afterward."</p>
<p>You could have sworn that Professor Quirrell was watching
Severus Snape with keen interest. Not the faintest trace of a smile
crossed the man's lips.</p>
<p>There was another long silence in the clearing.</p>
<p>"I do not know <i>who</i> Dumbledore fears," Snape said. "But I
know what bait he has set out, and somewhat of how it is truly
guarded -"</p>
<p>"As to that," said Professor Quirrell, sounding bored again, "I
stole it months ago, and left a fake in its place. But thank you
kindly for asking."</p>
<p>"You're lying," said Severus Snape after a pause.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am." Professor Quirrell leaned back against the grey
wood again, his eyes drifting up to the dense net of branches, the
falling night scarcely visible between the complex crossings. "I
simply wished to learn whether you would call me on it, since you
are pretending to know so little." The Defense Professor smiled to
himself.</p>
<p>The Potions Master looked like he was about to choke on his own
fury. "<i>What do you want?</i>"</p>
<p>"Nothing, really," said the Defense Professor, continuing to
gaze at the forest ceiling. "I was only curious. I suppose I shall
just watch and see where your plotting goes, and meanwhile I will
say nothing to the Headmaster - so long as you are willing to do me
a favor now and then, of course." A dry smile crossed the face.
"You are dismissed for now, Severus Snape. Though I wouldn't mind
having another little chat soon, if you're willing to speak with me
honestly of where your loyalties lie. And I do mean
<i>honestly,</i> not the false faces you've shown today. You might
find you have more allies than you thought. Take some time to think
it over, my friend."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Draco Malfoy and -</i></p>
<p>A rainbow hemisphere, a dome of solid force with little
chromaticity of its own which sent back the infringing light in
splintered reflections, iridescent in many colors, as it fractured
the shine of the many-splendored chandeliers of the Slytherin
common room.</p>
<p>Sheltered beneath the rainbow hemisphere, the terrified face of
a young witch who had never fought bullies, who had not joined any
of Professor Quirrell's armies, who was getting Acceptable marks at
best in her Defense class, who could not have cast a Prismatic
Barrier even to save her own life.</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it," said Draco Malfoy, making his voice sound bored
despite the sweat that had broken out underneath his robes, as he
kept his wand pointed at the barrier that was sheltering Millicent
Bulstrode.</p>
<p>He couldn't remember making the decision, there'd just been the
two older boys about to hex Millicent, the common room silently
staring, and then Draco's hand had just drawn his wand and cast the
barrier, leaving his heart to pump itself full of shocked
adrenaline while his poor sad brain frantically racked itself for
explanations -</p>
<p>The two older boys were straightening up from where they'd been
looming over Millicent, turning to Draco, looking at him with a
mixture of shock and anger. Gregory and Vincent beside him had
already drawn their own wands, but weren't pointing them. All three
of them together couldn't have won, anyway.</p>
<p>But the older boys wouldn't hex him. Nobody could possibly be
stupid enough to hex the next Lord Malfoy.</p>
<p>It wasn't fear of being hexed that was making Draco sweat
beneath his robes, as he desperately hoped the beads of water
weren't visible on his forehead.</p>
<p>Draco was sweating because of the dawning and sickening
certainty that even if he got away with this now, if he kept down
this path, there would come a time when it would all come crashing
down; and then he might not be the next Lord Malfoy anymore.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," said the oldest-looking boy. "Why are you
protecting her?"</p>
<p>"So you've located the mistress of the conspiracy," Draco said
with a Number Two Sneer, "and it's, let me get this straight now, a
first-year girl named Millicent Bulstrode. She's just a
<i>conduit</i>, you <i>niddlewit!</i>"</p>
<p>"So?" demanded the older boy. "She still helped them!"</p>
<p>Draco lifted his wand and the Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still
talking in a bored voice, Draco said, "<i>Did</i> you know what you
were doing, Miss Bulstrode?"</p>
<p>"N-no," Millicent stammered from where she was still sitting at
her desk.</p>
<p>"Did you know where the Slytherin messages you were passing on
were going to?"</p>
<p>"No!" said Millicent.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Draco said. "All of you please leave her alone,
she's just a pawn. Miss Bulstrode, you may consider the favor you
did me in February to have been repaid." And Draco turned back to
his Potions homework, hoping to Merlin and back again that
Millicent didn't say anything incredibly stupid like 'What favor?'
-</p>
<p>"Then why," a voice said clearly from across the room, "did
those witches go where a note from Millicent told them to go?"</p>
<p>Sweating even more, Draco lifted his head again to look at where
Randolph Lee had spoken. "What did the fake note say exactly?" said
Draco. "Was it, 'I command you to go forth in the name of the Dark
Lady Bulstrode' or 'Please meet me here, sincerely Millicent?'"</p>
<p>Randolph Lee opened his mouth, hesitated for a fractional second
-</p>
<p>"I thought so," said Draco. "That wasn't a very good test, Mr.
Lee, it - it can -" A frantic, nerve-racking moment while he
figured out how to say it without using Harry-words like <i>false
positive.</i> "It can get the witches to go there if any of them is
just <i>friends</i> with Millicent."</p>
<p>As though the matter had been entirely settled, Draco looked
down again at his Potions homework, ignoring (except for the
feeling of sick dread in his stomach) the whispers from around the
room.</p>
<p>It was only out of the corner of his eye that he caught Gregory
staring at him.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco's eyes rested on his Astronomy homework, but he couldn't
make his mind focus there. If you were trying not to think about
things Harry Potter had said, pretty much the worst possible thing
you could do was look at your textbook's pictures of the night sky,
and try to remember what you <i>weren't</i> supposed to know about
how the planets wandered. Astronomy, a noble and prestigious art, a
sign of learning and knowledge; only Muggles possessed secret
modern artifacts which could do it a million billion times better
using methods that Harry had tried to explain and which Draco still
couldn't begin to understand except that apparently it didn't even
take <i>magic</i> to make <i>things</i> do <i>Arithmancy.</i></p>
<p>Draco looked at the pictures of constellations, and wondered if
it was like this in the other Houses, if people were always
threatening each other in Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had told him once that soldiers on a battlefield
didn't really fight for their country. Patriotism might get them to
the battlefield in the first place, but once they were there, they
fought to protect <i>each other,</i> the friends they'd trained
with who were right in front of them. And Harry had observed, and
Draco had known that it was true, that you couldn't use loyalty to
a leader to power a Patronus Charm, it wasn't <i>quite</i> the
right kind of warm and happy thought. But thinking of protecting
someone beside you -</p>
<p>That, Harry Potter had said thoughtfully, was probably why the
Death Eaters had fallen apart the moment the Dark Lord had
departed. They hadn't been warm enough to <i>each other</i>.</p>
<p>You could recruit a group that included Bellatrix Black and
Amycus Carrow alongside Lord Malfoy and Mr. MacNair, and keep them
in line with the Cruciatus Curse. But the instant the master of the
Dark Mark was gone, you didn't have an army anymore, you had a
circle of acquaintances. That was why Father had failed. It hadn't
even really been his fault. There'd been nothing Father
<i>could</i> have done, after inheriting Death Eaters who weren't
really <i>friends</i> with each other.</p>
<p>And even though it was Slytherin House he was supposed to defend
- Slytherin House which he and Harry had formed a pact to
<i>save</i> - sometimes Draco couldn't help but think that it was
just less <i>wearisome</i> when he was leading army practices. When
he was working with students from the other three Houses that
weren't Slytherin. Once you saw and named the problems, you
couldn't <i>stop</i> seeing them, it just got more <i>annoying</i>
every day.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy?" said the voice of Gregory Goyle, from where he was
lying on the floor beside Draco's desk, in the small but private
bedroom; Gregory was doing his Transfiguration homework, on which
he often needed help.</p>
<p>Any distraction was welcome at this point. "Yes?" said
Draco.</p>
<p>"You weren't really plotting against Granger at all," said
Gregory. "Were you?"</p>
<p>The sensation spreading through Draco's stomach felt just like
Gregory's voice sounded, sickened and afraid.</p>
<p>"You actually were helping Granger, that day you picked her up
off the floor," said Gregory. "And before, that time you kept her
from falling off the roof. You <i>helped</i> a <i>mudblood</i>
-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, right," said Draco sarcastically, without the slightest
hesitation or delay, looking back down at his Astronomy homework
like he wasn't the least bit nervous. It was all happening the way
Draco had feared it would, but at least that meant he'd played this
conversation in his head over and over, coming up with the right
opening gambit. "Come on, Gregory, you've dueled General Granger,
you <i>know</i> how strong her spells are. Like a real Muggle-spawn
is going to be more powerful than you, more powerful than Theodore,
more powerful than every single pureblood in our whole school year
except me? Don't you actually <i>believe</i> in anything Father
says? She's <i>adopted.</i> Her parents died in the war and someone
stuck her with a couple of Muggles to hide her. No <i>way</i> is
General Granger a real mudblood."</p>
<p>A slow pulse of silence through Draco's bedroom. Draco wanted to
know, needed to know what look was on Gregory's face. But he
<i>couldn't</i> look up from his desk, not yet, not until Gregory
spoke first.</p>
<p>And then -</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> what Harry Potter said to you?" said
Gregory.</p>
<p>The voice wavered, and broke. When Draco looked up from his
homework, he saw that tears were leaking out of Gregory's eyes.</p>
<p>Apparently that hadn't worked.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to do," Gregory said in a whisper. "I don't
know what to do now, Mr. Malfoy. Your father isn't - when he finds
out - he's not going to like it, Mr. Malfoy!"</p>
<p><i>It's not</i> your <i>job to decide what Father will like,
Goyle -</i></p>
<p>Draco could hear the words in his head; they sounded in Father's
voice, with the same sternness. It was the sort of thing Father had
<i>told</i> him to say, if Vincent or Gregory ever questioned him;
and if that didn't work he was to hex them. They were <i>not</i>
equal friends, Father had said, and he wasn't ever to forget it.
Draco was in charge, they were his servants, and if Draco couldn't
keep it that way then he wasn't fit to inherit House Malfoy...</p>
<p>"It's all right, Gregory," Draco said, as gently as he could.
"All you've got to do is worry about protecting me. Nobody's going
to blame you for following my orders, not my father, not yours."
Putting all the warmth he could into his voice, like trying to cast
a Patronus Charm. "And anyway, the next war isn't going to be the
same as the last one. House Malfoy was around long before the Dark
Lord, and not every Lord Malfoy does the same thing. Father knows
that."</p>
<p>"Does he?" said Gregory in trembling voice. "Does he
<i>really?</i>"</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "Professor Quirrell knows it too," said Draco.
"That's what the armies are about. The Defense Professor's right,
when the next war comes, Father won't be able to unite the whole
country, they'll remember the <i>last</i> war. But anyone who's
fought in Professor Quirrell's armies will remember who the
strongest generals were, they'll know who's worthy to lead them.
They'll proclaim Harry Potter their Lord, and I'll be his right
hand, and House Malfoy will come out on top, like always. People
might even turn to <i>me,</i> if Potter isn't there, so long as
they think I'm trustworthy. That's what I'm setting up now. Father
will understand."</p>
<p>Gregory reached up and wiped his eyes, looking down again at his
Transfiguration homework. "Okay," Gregory said in a shaky voice.
"If you say so, Mr. Malfoy."</p>
<p>Draco nodded again, ignoring the hollow feeling inside himself
at the lies he'd just told his friend, and turned back to the
stars.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Hermione Granger and -</i></p>
<p>Being invisible should've been more <i>interesting</i> than
this, the corridors of Hogwarts should have been outlined in
strange colors or something. But actually, Hermione thought, being
under Harry's invisibility cloak was exactly like <i>not</i> being
under an invisibility cloak, except for the cloak part. When you
pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood and over
your face, you couldn't even see it stretching in front of you, and
afterward it didn't seem to impede your breathing. And the world
looked just the same, except that when you walked past things of
metal, you didn't see any small reflections of yourself. Portraits
never looked at you, only did whatever strange things they did when
they were alone. Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet,
she wasn't sure she <i>wanted</i> to. Most of all, there was no
<i>you</i> anymore as you walked around, no hands, no feet, just a
changing point of view. It was an unnerving feeling, not so much of
being <i>invisible</i> as of <i>not existing.</i></p>
<p>Harry hadn't questioned her at all, she'd just got out the word
'invisibility' and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak
from his pouch. She hadn't even been given a chance to explain
about her extremely secret meeting with Daphne and Millicent
Bulstrode, or that she thought it would help protect the other
girls, Harry had just handed over what was probably a Deathly
Hallow. If you were fair, and she <i>did</i> try to be fair, she
had to admit that sometimes Harry could be a very true, true
friend.</p>
<p>The secret meeting itself had been a great big failure.</p>
<p>Millicent had claimed to be a seer.</p>
<p>Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at
considerable length that this could not possibly be true.</p>
<p>She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their
research; Harry had insisted that they read everything they could
find about prophecies that wasn't in the Restricted Section. As
Harry had observed, it would save a lot of effort if they could
just get a seer to prophesy everything they would figure out
thirty-five years later. (Or to put it in Harry's terms, any means
of obtaining information transmitted from the distant future was
potentially an instant global victory condition.)</p>
<p>But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn't
controllable, there was no way to <i>ask</i> for a prophecy about
anything in particular. Instead (the books had said) there was a
sort of <i>pressure</i> that built up in Time, when some huge event
was trying to happen, or stop itself from happening. And seers were
like weak points that let out the pressure, when the right listener
was nearby. So prophecies were only about big, important things,
because only that generated enough pressure; and you almost never
got more than one seer saying the same thing, because afterward the
pressure was gone. And, as Hermione had further explained to
Millicent, the seers themselves didn't remember their prophecies,
because the message wasn't for <i>them</i>. And the messages would
come out in riddles, and only someone who heard the prophecy in the
seer's original voice would hear all the meaning that was in the
riddle. There was no <i>possible</i> way that Millicent could just
give out a prophecy <i>any time she wanted</i>, about <i>school
bullies</i>, and then <i>remember</i> it, and if she <i>had</i> it
would've come out as 'the skeleton is the key' and not 'Susan Bones
has to be there'.</p>
<p>Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so
Hermione had relaxed her fists where they'd been jammed on her
hips, calmed herself down, and stated carefully that she was glad
Millicent had helped them, but they <i>had</i> sometimes walked
into traps following what Millicent said, and so Hermione really
did want to know where the messages had <i>actually</i> come
from.</p>
<p>And Millicent had said in a small voice:</p>
<p><i>But, but she told</i> me <i>that she was a seer...</i></p>
<p>Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had
refused to give up her source. It wasn't just that Hermione had
felt awful about the scared look on Millicent's face. It was that
Hermione had a strong feeling that if they <i>did</i> find the
person who'd been telling Millicent things, why, <i>they</i> would
turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillow in the
morning.</p>
<p>She was getting that same despairing feeling she'd gotten in the
battle before Christmas, looking at Zabini's charts with all the
colored lines and boxes and... and she had only just now realized
what it meant that <i>Zabini</i> had been the one showing her that
chart.</p>
<p>Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having
your life get overly complicated.</p>
<p>Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps
protruding from a central spine, a poorly-kept "secret" staircase
that was actually one of the fastest ways up from the Slytherin
dungeons to the Ravenclaw tower, but which only witches could
traverse. (Why girls in particular needed a quick way to move from
Ravenclaw to Slytherin and back was something Hermione found a bit
puzzling.) At the top of the staircase, now that she was away from
Slytherin places and back into the main parts of Hogwarts, Hermione
stopped and took off Harry's invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right
and started to walk down a short passageway, now automatically
keeping an eye out in all directions without really thinking about
it, and her constantly-scanning eyes glanced into a shadowy alcove
-</p>
<p><i>(fleeting disorientation)</i></p>
<p>- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex
over her whole body, she found that without any thought or any
conscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was
already pointed at...</p>
<p>...a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to
determine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop
the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat; and a black mist seemed to
gather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might
lie beneath.</p>
<p>"Hello again, Hermione," whispered a sibilant voice from beneath
the black hat, from behind the black mist.</p>
<p>Hermione's heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest,
her witch's robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin,
there was a taste of fear already in her mouth; she didn't know why
she was so suddenly filled up with adrenaline but her hand gripped
harder on her wand. "Who are you?" Hermione demanded.</p>
<p>The hat tilted slightly; the whispery voice, when it came forth
from the black mist, sounded dry as dust. "The last ally," spoke
the sibilant whisper. "The one who finally answers, when no other
will answer you. I am perhaps the only <i>true</i> friend you have
in all Hogwarts, Hermione. For you have now seen how the others
stayed silent when you were in need -"</p>
<p>"What's your <i>name?</i>"</p>
<p>The black cloak rotated slightly, back and forth, it didn't
<i>look</i> like shoulders shrugging, but it conveyed a shrug.
"That is the riddle, young Ravenclaw. Until you solve it, you may
call me whatever you wish."</p>
<p>She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for the
spiral grooves on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip
on the wood. "Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person," Hermione
said, "what do you want with me?"</p>
<p>"That is the wrong question," came the whisper from black mist.
"You should ask, rather, what <i>I</i> can offer <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"No," the young girl said quite steadily, "I don't think I
<i>should</i> be asking that, actually."</p>
<p>A high-pitched chuckle from behind the black mist. "Not power,"
whispered the voice, "not wealth, you care little for such things,
do you, young Ravenclaw? <i>Knowledge</i>. That is what I possess.
I know what is unfolding within this school, all the hidden plans
and players, the answers of the riddle. I know the true reason for
the coldness you see in Harry Potter's eyes. I know the true nature
of Professor Quirrell's mysterious illness. I know who Dumbledore
truly fears."</p>
<p>"Good for you," said Hermione Granger. "But do you know how many
licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie
Pop?"</p>
<p>The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded
lower when it spoke, disappointed. "So you are not even curious,
young Ravenclaw, about the truths behind the lies?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and eighty-seven," she said. "I tried it once and
that's how many it came out to." Her hand was almost slipping on
her wand, there was a sense of fatigue in her fingers like she'd
been holding the wand for hours instead of minutes -</p>
<p>The voice hissed, "Professor Snape is a hidden Death Eater."</p>
<p>Hermione almost dropped her wand.</p>
<p>"Ah," the voice whispered in satisfaction. "I thought that might
interest you. So, Hermione. Is there anything else you would like
to know about your enemies, or those you call friends?"</p>
<p>She stared up at the black mist that topped the towering black
cloak, frantically trying to order her thoughts. Professor Snape
was a Death Eater? Who would tell <i>her</i> something like that,
<i>why,</i> what was going <i>on?</i> "That's -" Hermione said. Her
voice was quavering. "That's extremely serious business, if it's
really true. Why are you telling something like that to <i>me,</i>
and not to Headmaster Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore did nothing to stop Snape," the black mist
whispered. "You saw it, Hermione. The rot at Hogwarts begins at the
top. Everything that is wrong with this school, it all begins with
the mad Headmaster. You alone dared to call him out for it - and
therefore I speak to you."</p>
<p>"And have you also spoken to Harry Potter, then?" Hermoine said,
keeping her voice as even as she could. If <i>this</i> was his
helpful ghost -</p>
<p>The black mist darkened and lightened, like a shake of the head.
"I am frightened of Harry Potter," it whispered. "Of the coldness
in his eyes, of the darkness that grows behind them. Harry Potter
is a killer, and anyone who is an obstacle to him will die. Even
you, Hermione Granger, if you dare truly oppose him, the darkness
behind his eyes will reach out and destroy you. This I know."</p>
<p>"Then you don't know half of what you pretend to know," Hermione
said, her voice a little firmer. "I'm scared of Harry too. But not
because of what he might ever do to <i>me</i>. I'm scared of what
he might do to <i>protect</i> me -"</p>
<p>"Wrong." The whisper was flat, and hard, as if to brook no
possibility of denial. "Harry Potter <i>will</i> turn against you
in time, Hermione, when the darkness takes him fully. He will not
shed a tear, he will not even notice, on the day his footsteps
finally crush you underneath."</p>
<p>"<i>Double</i> wrong!" she said back in a rising voice, even
though there were chills going down her spine. One of Harry's
phrases came to her. "Just what do you think you know, and how do
you think you know it, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Time -" The voice seemed to catch itself. "Time enough for that
later. For now, for today, indeed Harry Potter is not your enemy.
And yet you are in gravest danger."</p>
<p>"I can believe <i>that</i>," said Hermione Granger. She
desperately wanted to shift her wand to her other hand, she felt
like she needed to grab her right arm just to keep it up, her head
ached like she'd been staring at the black mist for days; she
didn't know why she'd gotten tired so quickly.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy has taken notice of you, Hermione." The whisper
had risen, departed from its tonelessness, taken on a note of
audible concern. "You have humiliated Slytherin House, you have
defeated his son in battle. Even before then you were an
embarrassment to all who stand with the Death Eaters; for you are a
Muggleborn and yet you possess a power of wizardry greater than any
pureblood. And now you are becoming known, the eyes of the world on
you. Lucius Malfoy seeks to crush you, Hermione, to hurt you and
perhaps even kill you, and he has the means to do it!" The whisper
had grown urgent.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" Hermione said. If she was ex-Colonel Zabini or
Harry Potter, she'd probably be asking clever questions to gather
more information; but her mind felt slow and fatigued. She really
needed to get out of here and go lie down for a while.</p>
<p>"You don't believe me," the whisper said, softer and sadder now.
"Why not, Hermione? I <i>am</i> trying to help you."</p>
<p>Hermione took a step backward, away from the shadowy alcove.</p>
<p>"<i>Why not, Hermione?</i>" demanded the voice, rising to a
hiss. "You owe me that much! Tell me, and then -" The voice caught,
and came back quieter. "And then you can go, I suppose. Only tell
me - <i>why</i> -"</p>
<p>Maybe she shouldn't've answered; maybe she should've just turned
and fled, or better yet, cast a Prismatic Wall first and then
screamed at the top of her lungs as she ran; but it was the note of
real pain in the voice that caught her, and so she answered.</p>
<p>"Because you look incredibly dark and scary and suspicious,"
Hermione said, keeping her voice polite, as her wand stayed level
on the towering black cloak and the faceless black mist.</p>
<p>"That's <i>all?</i>" whispered the voice incredulously. Sadness
seemed to infuse it. "I hoped for better from you, Hermione. Surely
such a Ravenclaw as you, the most intelligent Ravenclaw to grace
Hogwarts in a generation, knows that appearances can be
misleading."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it," said Hermione. She took another step back, her
tired fingers tightening on the wand. "But the thing that people
forget sometimes, is that even though appearances <i>can</i> be
misleading, they're usually <i>not.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"You <i>are</i> the clever one," said the voice, and the black
mist evaporated away, no longer obscuring; she saw the face
beneath, and recognition sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline
bursting through her -</p>
<p><i>(fleeting disorientation)</i></p>
<p>- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex
over her whole body, she found that without any thought or any
conscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was
already pointed at...</p>
<p>...a shining lady, her long white dress billowing about her as
though in invisible winds; neither her hands nor her feet were
visible, her face hidden beneath a white veil; and she was glowing
all over, not like a ghost, not transparent, just surrounded by
soft white light.</p>
<p>Hermione stared open-mouthed at the gentle sight, wondering why
her heart was already hammering, and why she felt so scared.</p>
<p>"Hello again, Hermione," the kindly whisper emanated from the
white glow behind the veil. "I've been sent to help you, so please
don't be afraid. I am your servant in all things; for you, my Lady,
are the bearer of a most marvelous destiny -"</p>

</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="78">Chapter 78</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs Prelude:
Cheating</h3>
<p>It was Saturday, on the 4th of April, in the year 1992.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis looked rather nervous, as they sat in a
certain special section of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands - though
today the cushioned benches did not look upon flying broomsticks,
but rather viewed a gigantic square of something like parchment; a
great white blankness soon to flicker with windows into grass and
soldiers. For now it showed only the reflected dull gray color of
the surrounding overcast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though the
weather-wizards had promised that the rain wouldn't break before
nightfall.)</p>
<p>Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere
parents were to Stay Out - for much the same reason that impatient
children are told to get out of the kitchen and not meddle in the
cook's affairs. The only reason for a parent-teacher conference was
if a teacher felt that a parent wasn't shaping up properly. It took
an exceptional circumstance to make the Hogwarts administration
feel that <i>it</i> had to justify itself to <i>you.</i> On any
given occasion, generally speaking, the Hogwarts administration was
backed up by eight hundred years of distinguished history and you
were not.</p>
<p>Thus it had been with some trepidation that Mr. and Mrs. Davis
had insisted on an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It
was hard to muster a proper sense of indignation when you were
confronting the same dignified witch who, twelve years and four
months earlier, had given both of you two weeks' detention after
catching you in the act of conceiving Tracey.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. and Mrs. Davis's courage had been helped
by angrily waving about a copy of <i>The</i> <i>Quibbler</i> whose
headline showed, in bright bold text for all the world to see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">PACTS WITH POTTER?<br />
BONES, DAVIS, GRANGER<br />
IN LOVE RECTANGLE OF FEAR</p>
<p>And so Mr. and Mrs. Davis had argued their way into the Faculty
Box of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands, where they were now ensconced
with an excellent view of Professor Quirrell's enchanted screens,
so that the two of them could see for themselves "Just what the
Fiddly-Snocks has been going on in this school, if you'll pardon
the expression, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall!"</p>
<p>Seated to the left of Mr. Davis was another concerned parent, a
white-haired man in elegant black robes of unmatchable quality, one
Lucius Malfoy, political leader of the strongest faction of the
Wizengamot.</p>
<p>To the left of Lord Malfoy, a sneeringly aristocratic man with a
scarred face who had been introduced to them as Lord Jugson.</p>
<p>Then an elderly but sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott,
rumored to be nearly as wealthy as Lord Malfoy, seated on Lord
Jugson's left.</p>
<p>On the right of Mrs. Davis, one would find the comely Lady and
yet handsomer Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Greengrass. Young they were as wizards counted age, garbed in grey
silken robes set with tiny dark emeralds embroidered into the shape
of grass blades. The Lady Greengrass was considered a key swing
vote on the Wizengamot, her own mother having retired from the body
with surprising speed. Her charming husband, though his family was
not noble or wealthy of itself, had taken a seat on the Hogwarts
Board of Governors.</p>
<p>To their right, a square-jawed and incredibly tough-looking old
witch, who had shaken hands with Mr. and Mrs. Davis without the
slightest hint of condescension. This was Amelia Bones, Director of
the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>To Amelia's right was a seniorish woman who had set the fashion
scene of magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture
into her hat, one Augusta Longbottom. Though she was not addressed
as Lady, Madam Longbottom would exercise the full rights of the
Longbottom family for so long as their last scion had yet to attain
his majority, and she was considered a prominent figure in a
minority faction of the Wizengamot.</p>
<p>At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than Chief
Warlock Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, legendary defeater of Grindelwald, protector of
Britain, rediscoverer of the fabled twelve uses of dragon's blood,
the most powerful wizard in the world &amp;c.</p>
<p>And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic
Defense Professor of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning
back on the cushioned benches as though resting; seeming entirely
and naturally at ease in the rarefied company of a voting quorum of
the Hogwarts Board of Governors, which had dropped by on this fine
Saturday to learn just what the Fiddly-Snocks had been going on at
Hogwarts in general and with Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne
Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom in particular. The
name of Harry Potter had also been much discussed.</p>
<p>Oh, and one mustn't forget Tracey Davis, of course. Director
Bones's eyebrows had climbed in some interest upon hearing the
young couple introduced as her parents. Lord Jugson had given them
a brief, incredulous stare before dismissing them with a snort.
Lucius Malfoy had greeted them politely, his smile containing a
hint of grim amusement mixed with pity.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance
had been touching their wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who
had all of three hundred Galleons stored in their Gringotts vault,
and who respectively worked at selling cauldrons in a Potions shop
and enchanting Omnioculars, were pressed up tightly against each
other, sitting rigidly erect upon their cushioned benches, and
desperately wishing they'd worn nicer robes.</p>
<p>The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker
and lighter grays, grim with the promise of future storms; though
no lightning flickered as yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder
echoed; and only a few threatening droplets had fallen.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>To their designated starting place in a certain forest, the
Sunshine Regiment marched, though it was really more like a slow
walk; you wouldn't want to tire yourself out before the battle even
started, and the breezes of April were annoyingly humid, though
cool. Ahead of them, a yellow flame wandered slowly through the
air, guiding them according to their pace.</p>
<p>Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the Sunshine
General as they marched through the grayly illuminated forest.
Professor Snape's going after Hermione seemed to have really shaken
her. Hermione had even missed her Sunshine Regiment Official
Planning Meeting, which seemed understandable enough; but when
Susan had offered her sympathy afterward, Hermione had stammered
that she'd lost track of time, which wasn't at all a usual thing
for her to say, and the girl had looked exhausted and frightened
like she'd just spent three days locked in a bathroom stall with a
Dementor. Even now, when all the Sunshine General's focus should've
been on the coming battle, the Ravenclaw girl's gaze was constantly
darting in all directions, as though she expected Dark Wizards to
jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.</p>
<p>"The ban on Muggle artifacts cuts down our options a lot,"
Anthony Goldstein was saying in the dour tones the boy used to
denote deliberate pessimism. "I had the idea of trying to
Transfigure nets to throw on people, but -"</p>
<p>"No good," said Ernie Macmillan. The Hufflepuff boy shook his
head, looking even more serious than Anthony. "I mean, it's just
like throwing a hex, they'd <i>dodge</i>."</p>
<p>Anthony nodded. "That's what I figured, too. Do you have any
ideas, Seamus?"</p>
<p>The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked a bit nervous and
out-of-place, marching along with his new comrades in the Sunshine
Regiment. "Sorry," said the newly minted Captain Finnigan. "I'm
more the strategic master type."</p>
<p>"<i>I'm</i> the strategic master type," said Ron Weasley,
sounding put-off.</p>
<p>"There are <i>three</i> armies," the Sunshine General said
acerbically, "which means we fight <i>two</i> armies at once, which
means we need more than one strategist, which means shut up,
Ron!"</p>
<p>Ron gave their General a surprised and worried look. "Hey," the
Gryffindor boy said in a calming tone, "you shouldn't let Snape get
to you so much -"</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> think we ought to do, General?" Susan said
very loudly and quickly. "I mean, we don't really have a plan at
this point." Their official planning session had failed
<i>amazingly</i> with Hermione gone and both Ron and Anthony
thinking they were in charge.</p>
<p>"Do we really need a plan?" the Sunshine General said, sounding
a little distracted. "We've got you and me and Lavender and Parvati
and Hannah and Daphne and Ron and Ernie and Anthony <i>and</i>
Captain Finnigan."</p>
<p>"That -" began Anthony.</p>
<p>"Sounds like a pretty good strategy," Ron said with an approving
nod. "We've got as many strong soldiers now as both other armies
put together. Chaos's only got Potter and Longbottom and Nott left
- well, and Zabini too, I suppose -"</p>
<p>"And Tracey," said Hermione.</p>
<p>Several people swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>stop it,</i>" Susan said sharply. "She's just a
battle-hardened member of S.P.H.E.W., that's all General Sunshine
means."</p>
<p>"Still," Ernie said, turning to look seriously at Susan, "I
think you'd better go with whatever group fights Chaos, Captain
Bones. I know you can't use your double magical powers except when
innocents are in danger, but I mean - just in case Miss Davis
<i>does,</i> you know, go out of control and try to eat someone's
soul -"</p>
<p>"I can handle her," Susan told him, keeping her voice
reassuring. Admittedly, Susan hadn't been replaced by a
Metamorphmagus at the moment, but then Tracey probably wasn't
Polyjuiced Dumbledore or whoever.</p>
<p>Captain Finnigan intoned in a deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, "I
find your lack of skepticism disturbing." He raised his hand with
his thumb and forefinger almost touching, pointed at Ernie.</p>
<p>For some reason Anthony Goldstein seemed to be having a sudden
choking fit. "What's that supposed to mean?" said Ernie.</p>
<p>"It's just something General Potter says sometimes," said
Captain Finnigan. "Funny, when you first join the Chaos Legion it
all seems crazy, and then after a couple of months you realize that
actually everyone who <i>isn't</i> in the Chaos Legion is crazy
-"</p>
<p>"I <i>said</i>," Ron said loudly, "it sounds like good strategy.
We don't Transfigure anything, we don't tire ourselves out, we
handle whatever they throw at us, and then we just overrun
them."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione. "Let's do that."</p>
<p>"But -" said Anthony, shooting a glare at Ron. "But General,
Harry Potter's got <i>sixteen</i> people left in his army. Dragon
and us each have twenty-eight. Harry <i>knows</i> that, he knows
he's <i>got</i> to come up with something <i>incredible</i> -"</p>
<p>"Like <i>what?</i>" demanded Hermione, sounding stressed. "If
we don't <i>know</i> what he's planning, we might as well save our
magic for doing massed <i>Finites.</i> Like we <i>should've</i>
done <i>last</i> time!"</p>
<p>Susan touched Hermione gently on the shoulder. "General
Granger?" said Susan. "I think you should take a break for a bit
before the battle."</p>
<p>She'd been expecting Hermione to argue, but Hermione just nodded
and then walked a little faster, pulling away from the Sunshine
Regiment Official Officer Group, her eyes still watching the
forest, and sometimes the sky.</p>
<p>Susan followed her. It wouldn't do, having it look like the
Sunshine General was being ejected from her own Official Officer
Group.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Susan said softly, after they'd walked a bit away.
"You've got to focus. Professor Quirrell's in charge here, not
Snape, and he won't let anything bad happen to you or anyone."</p>
<p>"You're not helping," Hermione said, sounding shaky. "You're not
helping at all, Captain Bones."</p>
<p>The two of them walked faster, circling around some of the other
soldiers, inspecting the marching perimeter and glancing at the
surrounding trees.</p>
<p>"Susan?" Hermione said in a small voice, when they'd gotten
further away from all the others. "Do you think Daphne's right
about Draco Malfoy plotting something?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Susan said at once, not even thinking about it. "You can
tell, because his name's got the letters M-A-L-F-O and Y in
it."</p>
<p>Hermione looked around, as if to make sure that nobody was
watching, although of course that was a wonderful way to get other
people to pay attention to you. "Could Malfoy have been behind what
Snape did?"</p>
<p>"Snape could be behind Malfoy," Susan said thoughtfully,
remembering dinner-table conversations she'd heard at Auntie's, "or
Lucius Malfoy could be behind both of them." A slight chill went
down Susan's spine as this last thought occurred to her. Suddenly,
telling Hermione to just focus on the coming battle seemed a lot
less reasonable. "Why, did you find some sort of clue about
that?"</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. "No," the Ravenclaw girl said, in a
voice that sounded almost like she was about to cry. "I was - just
thinking about it myself - that's all."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon
General and the warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red
flame had led them, beneath grey skies.</p>
<p>At Draco's right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command,
who had once led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned.
At Draco's back was Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had
served the Malfoys into the distance of forgotten memory; the
muscular boy was watchful as he was always watchful, whether battle
had been declared or no. Further back, Gregory of the Goyles stood
waiting beside one of the two broomsticks Dragon Army had been
given; if the Goyles had not served the Malfoys so long as the
Crabbes, yet they had served no less well.</p>
<p>And at Draco's left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of
Gryffindor, a mudblood or possible half-blood who knew nothing of
his father.</p>
<p>Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberate
move on Harry's part, Draco was certain. Three other former
Chaotics had also been transferred to Dragon Army, and all were
watching Draco hawklike to see if he offered the former Lieutenant
the slightest insult.</p>
<p>Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better. Harry
had also sent Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even
though Professor Quirrell's mandate had only required that Harry
give up <i>one</i> Lieutenant. That too had been a deliberate move,
making crystal clear to everyone that Harry <i>wasn't</i> dumping
his least-favored soldiers.</p>
<p>In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the
true loyalties of his new soldiers if they'd thought Harry hadn't
wanted them. In another sense... well, it wasn't easy to put into
words. Harry had given him good soldiers with their pride intact,
but it was more than that. Harry had showed kindliness toward his
soldiers, but it was more than <i>that</i>. It wasn't just Harry
playing fair, it was something that... that you couldn't help but
contrast with the way the game was played in Slytherin House.</p>
<p>So Draco hadn't offered the slightest insult to Mr. Thomas, but
brought him straight to his side, subordinate to himself and Padma
but no one else. It was a test, Draco had told Mr. Thomas and
everyone, not a promotion. Mr. Thomas would have to show himself
worthy of rank within Dragon Army - but he would be given a chance,
and the chance <i>would</i> be fair. Mr. Thomas had looked
surprised at the ceremony of it (the Chaos Legion, from what Draco
had heard, didn't stand on formality) but the Gryffindor boy had
stood a little straighter, and nodded.</p>
<p>And then, after Mr. Thomas had done well enough in one of Dragon
Army's training sessions, he'd been brought into the strategy
session in Dragon Army's huge military office. And a few minutes
into the session, Padma had happened to ask - as though it was a
perfectly normal question - whether Mr. Thomas had any ideas about
how to defeat the Chaos Legion.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted
that General Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that,
and that Harry had given him the message that General Malfoy should
ask himself where his relative advantage lay - what Draco Malfoy
could do, or what Dragon Army could do, that the Chaos Legion
couldn't match - and then try to exploit it for all it was worth.
Dean Thomas couldn't think of what that advantage might be, but if
he <i>did</i> come up with any ideas for beating Chaos, he'd share
them. Harry had ordered him to, after all.</p>
<p><i>Sigh,</i> Draco had thought, since he couldn't actually sigh
out loud. But it was good advice, and Draco had followed it,
sitting at his bedroom desk with quill and parchment listing out
everything that might be a relative advantage.</p>
<p>And, almost to Draco's own surprise, he'd had an <i>idea,</i> a
real one. In fact he'd had <i>two.</i></p>
<p>The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding
more ominous than ever before. On the instant, the two pilots cried
"<i>Up!</i>" and leapt onto their broomsticks, heading into the
gray sky.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis had now slumped slightly against each other,
more from sheer muscle exhaustion than from any decrease of
tension. Before them, the vast blank white parchment flickered with
three great windows, as though holes had been cut through into the
forest, showing three armies on the march. Lesser windows showed
the six riders upon their broomsticks, and the corner of the
parchment showed a view of the entire forest, with glowing dots to
indicate armies and scouts.</p>
<p>The window into Sunshine showed General Granger and her Captains
marching in the center of the Sunshine Regiment, protected by
<i>Contego</i> screens along with a number of other young witches.
The Sunshine Regiment, the Defense Professor had remarked, knew
well that it had now acquired a strong advantage in experienced
soldiers, and it meant to protect those soldiers from a surprise
attack. Aside from that, the Sunshine Soldiers were moving forward
at a steady march, conserving their strength.</p>
<p>The soldiers in General Malfoy's army, at least those with
higher Transfiguration scores, were picking up leaves and
Transfiguring them into... well, if you looked at Padma Patil, who
was almost done with hers, it looked like her leaf was becoming a
left-handed glove bearing a dangling strap. (The window had zoomed
in to show this.)</p>
<p>Lord Jugson was watching the screen with a flat expression; his
voice, when he spoke, seemed to ooze and drip with disdain. "What
<i>is</i> your son doing, Lucius?"</p>
<p>The foreign-born witch who stood at Draco Malfoy's right side
had finished Transfiguring her glove, and was now bringing it
before the Dragon General like a sacrifice.</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Lucius Malfoy, his tone calm though no
less aristocratic, "but I must trust that he has good reason for
doing it."</p>
<p>All Dragon Army stopped for a moment as Padma slid the glove
over her left hand, strapped it in place, and presented it before
Draco Malfoy; who also stopped in place, took several deep breaths,
raised his wand, executed a precise set of eight movements and
bellowed "<i>Colloportus!</i>"</p>
<p>The Dragon Warrior raised her gloved hand, flexed it, and gave a
small bow to Draco Malfoy, who returned it more shallowly, though
the Dragon General was staggering slightly. Padma then returned to
her place at Draco's side, and the Dragons began marching once
more.</p>
<p>"Well," remarked Augusta Longbottom. "I don't suppose someone
would care to explain?" Amelia Bones was frowning slightly as she
gazed at the screen.</p>
<p>"For some reason or other," said the amused voice of Professor
Quirrell, "it seems that the scion of Malfoy is able to cast
surprisingly strong magic for a first-year student. Due to the
purity of his blood, of course. Certainly the good Lord Malfoy
would not have openly flouted the underage magic laws by arranging
for his son to receive a wand before his acceptance into
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"I suggest you be careful in your implications, Quirrell,"
Lucius Malfoy said coldly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am," Professor Quirrell said. "A <i>Colloportus</i>
cannot be dispelled by <i>Finite Incantatem;</i> it requires an
<i>Alohomora</i> of equal strength. Until then, a glove so Charmed
will resist lesser material forces, deflect the Sleep Hex and the
Stunning Hex. And as neither Mr. Potter nor Miss Granger can cast a
counterspell powerful enough, that Charm is invincible upon this
battlefield. It is not the original intent of the Charm, nor the
intent of whoever taught Mr. Malfoy an emergency spell for evading
his enemies. But it would seem that Mr. Malfoy has been learning
creativity."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy had straightened as the Defense Professor spoke;
he now sat erect upon his cushioned bench, his head held
perceptibly higher than before, and when he spoke it was with quiet
pride. "He will be the greatest Lord Malfoy that has yet
lived."</p>
<p>"Faint praise," Augusta Longbottom said under her breath; Amelia
Bones chuckled, as did Mr. Davis for a tiny, fatal fraction of a
second before he stopped with a strangled gargle.</p>
<p>"I quite agree," said Professor Quirrell, though it wasn't clear
to whom he spoke. "Unfortunately for Mr. Malfoy, he is still new to
the art of creativity, and so he has committed a classic error of
Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>"And what might that be?" said Lucius Malfoy, his voice now
turned chill once more.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had leaned back in his seat, the pale blue
eyes briefly unfocusing as one of the windows shifted its viewpoint
within the greater screen, zooming in to show the sweat now on
Draco Malfoy's forehead. "It is such a beautiful idea that Mr.
Malfoy has quite overlooked its pragmatic difficulties."</p>
<p>"Would someone care to explain that?" said Lady Greengrass. "Not
all of us present are experts at such... affairs."</p>
<p>Amelia Bones spoke, the old witch's voice somewhat dry. "It will
tempt them to try to catch hexes that they would be wiser to simply
dodge. The more so, if they have had little practice catching them.
And the casting of so many Charms will tire their strongest
warrior."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gave the DMLE Director a half-nod of
acknowledgment. "As you say, Madam Bones. Mr. Malfoy is new to the
business of having ideas, and so when he has one, he becomes proud
of himself for having it. He has not yet had enough ideas to
unflinchingly discard those that are beautiful in some aspects and
impractical in others; he has not yet acquired confidence in his
own ability to think of better ideas as he requires them. What we
are seeing here is not Mr. Malfoy's best idea, I fear, but rather
his only idea."</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy simply turned to watch the screens again, as though
the Defense Professor had used up his right to exist.</p>
<p>"But -" said Lord Greengrass. "But <i>what</i> in Merlin's name
is Harry Potter -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Sixteen remaining soldiers of the Chaos Legion - or fifteen plus
Blaise Zabini, rather - marched confidently through the forest,
their shoes thudding over the still-dry ground. Their camouflage
uniforms blended into the forest even more than usual, all colors
washed out by the tints of an overcast day.</p>
<p>Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, against twenty-eight Dragon Warriors
and twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers.</p>
<p>The common consensus had been that, with odds <i>that</i> bad,
it was practically impossible for them to lose. After all, General
Chaos was <i>bound</i> to come up with something really
<i>spectacular,</i> facing odds like that.</p>
<p>There was something almost nightmarish about how everyone seemed
to now <i>expect</i> Harry to pull miracles out of his hat, on
demand, any time one was needed. It meant that if you couldn't do
the impossible, you were <i>disappointing your friends</i> and
<i>failing to live up to your potential...</i></p>
<p>Harry hadn't bothered complaining to Professor Quirrell about
'too much pressure'. Harry's mental model of the Defense Professor
had predicted him looking severely annoyed, saying things along the
lines of <i>You are perfectly capable of solving this problem, Mr.
Potter; did you even try?</i> and then deducting several hundred
Quirrell points.</p>
<p>From above, from where two broomsticks watched their march, the
high young voice of Tess Walsh cried "Friend!" and after another
moment, "Gingersnap!"</p>
<p>A handful of seconds later, the soldier who'd code-named herself
Gingersnap returned bearing a double handful of acorns, sweating
slightly in the cool but humid air from the jog that had taken her
to the oak tree Neville had spotted. Gingersnap approached to where
Shannon was holding a uniform-shirt with the neck tied off, in lieu
of anyone having to Transfigure a bag. When Gingersnap brought her
hands forward to try and dump her acorns into the holding-shirt,
Chaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked the shirt to the right, then to
the left again as Gingersnap made another effort to dump the
acorns, until a sharp "Miss Friedman!" from Lieutenant Nott caused
Shannon to sigh and hold the shirt still. Gingersnap dumped her
acorns into those accumulated, and then headed out for more.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the background, Ellie Knight was singing her very
own version of the Chaos Legion's marching song, and around half
the other soldiers were trying to step along with it despite not
knowing the tune in advance. Nearby, Nita Berdine, who had a high
Transfiguration score, finished creating yet another pair of green
sunglasses, and handed them to Adam Beringer, who folded up the
sunglasses before tucking them into his uniform pocket. Other
soldiers were already wearing their own green sunglasses, despite
the cloudy day.</p>
<p>You might guess that there was some sort of incredibly
complicated and fascinating explanation behind this, and you would
be right.</p>
<p>Two days earlier Harry had been sitting amid his bookcases in
the comfy rocking-chair he'd obtained for his trunk's cavern level,
pondering silently in the quiet span between classes and
dinnertime, thinking about power.</p>
<p>For sixteen Chaotics to defeat twenty-eight Sunnies and
twenty-eight Dragons they would need a force amplifier. There were
limits to what you could do with maneuver. There <i>had</i> to be a
secret weapon and it had to be invincible, or at least moderately
unstoppable.</p>
<p>Muggle artifacts were now illegal in Hogwarts's mock battles,
banned by Ministry edict. And the trouble with finding some other
clever and unusual spell was that an army twice your own size could
brute-force <i>Finite</i> almost anything you tried. The Sunshine
Regiment might have missed that tactic with the Transfigured
chainmail, but nobody would miss it again now that Professor
Quirrell had spelled it out. And <i>Finite Incantatem</i> was a
brute-force counterspell which required at least as much magic as
the spell being canceled... which, if you were severely
outnumbered, made it a whole new order of military challenge. The
enemy could <i>Finite</i> anything you tried, and still have enough
magic left over for shields and volleys of Sleep Hexes.</p>
<p>Unless, somehow, you could invoke potencies beyond the ordinary
strength of first-year Hogwarts students, something too powerful
for the enemy to <i>Finite</i>.</p>
<p>So Harry had asked Neville if he'd ever heard of any <i>small,
safe</i> sacrificial rituals -</p>
<p>And then, after the screaming and the shouting had subsided,
after Harry had stopped trying to argue about Unbreakable Vows and
just given up the whole thing as clearly impossible from a public
relations standpoint, Harry had realized that he hadn't even needed
to go there. They taught you how to invoke potencies far beyond
your own strength in ordinary Hogwarts classes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <i>what</i> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question.</p>
<p><i>Defense. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History of Magic.
Astronomy. Broomstick Flying. Herbology...</i></p>
<p>"<i>Foe!</i>" screamed the voice from above.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was a good thing that Neville Longbottom hadn't the tiniest
idea that his grandmother was watching; or he would've been more
self-conscious about screaming scary battlecries at the top of his
lungs while casting <i>Luminos</i> every three seconds as he
rocketed through a dense forest of trees, hot on the tail of
Gregory Goyle.</p>
<p>("But -" Augusta Longbottom said, her expression showing almost
as much astonishment as worry. "But Neville is afraid of
heights!")</p>
<p>("Not all fears last," said Amelia Bones. The old witch was
favoring the great screen before them with a measuring gaze. "Or
perhaps he has found courage. It is much the same, in the
end.")</p>
<p>A glimmer of red -</p>
<p>Neville dodged, very nearly into a tree but he <i>did</i> dodge;
and then Neville somehow also managed to dodge <i>almost</i> all of
the branches before they smacked him in the face.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Goyle's broomstick was pulling further and further away
- even though the two of them were riding exactly the same
broomstick and Mr. Goyle weighed more, somehow Neville was still
falling behind. So Neville slowed down, pulled back, angled up out
of the forest and began to accelerate back toward where the Chaos
Legion still marched.</p>
<p>Twenty seconds later - it hadn't been a <i>long</i> chase, just
an <i>exciting</i> one - Neville was back among his fellow
Chaotics, and dismounted his broom to walk on the ground for a
little bit.</p>
<p>"Neville -" said General Potter. Harry's voice was a little
distant, as he walked carefully and steadily through the forest,
his wand still applied to the almost-finished Form of the object he
was slowly Transfiguring. Beside him, Blaise Zabini, working a
smaller version of the same Transfiguration, looked like a
shambling Inferi as he stumbled forward. "I told you - Neville -
you don't have to -"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," said Neville. He looked down at where his fingers
grasped the broomstick, and saw that not just his hands, but his
whole arms were shaking. But unless anyone else in Chaos had been
practicing dueling for an hour a day with Mr. Diggory, and then
practicing their aim in private for another hour afterward, Neville
was probably the best shot from a broomstick even after taking into
account that he wasn't a very good flyer.</p>
<p>"Good show, Neville," Theodore said from where he was walking
ahead of them all, leading the Chaos Legion forward through the
forest while wearing only his undershirt.</p>
<p>(Augusta Longbottom and Charles Nott exchanged brief astonished
glances and then wrenched their gazes away from one another as
though stung.)</p>
<p>Neville took a few deep breaths, trying to steady his hands,
trying to think; Harry might not be good for deep strategic
thinking while he was in the middle of an extended Transfiguration.
"Lieutenant Nott, do you have any idea why Dragon Army just did
that? They <i>lost</i> a broom -" The Dragons had started the
combat with a feint to provide a distraction for Mr. Goyle's
approach through the forest; Neville hadn't realized there were
<i>two</i> brooms attacking until almost too late. But the Chaos
Legion had <i>gotten</i> the other pilot. That was why broomsticks
usually didn't attack before armies met, it meant a whole army
would concentrate fire on the broomstick. "And the Dragons didn't
even get anyone, did they?"</p>
<p>"Nope!" Tracey Davis said proudly. She too was now marching by
General Potter's side, her wand gripped low and watchful as her
eyes scanned the surrounding forest. "I threw up a Prismatic Sphere
like a split second before Mr. Goyle's hex got Zabini, and the way
Mr. Goyle had his other arm stretched out I think he planned to
knock down the General, too." The Slytherin witch smiled with
vicious confidence. "Mr. Goyle tried a Breaking Drill Hex, but
learned to his dismay that his weak magic was no match for my
newfound dark powers, hahahaha!"</p>
<p>Some Chaotics laughed with her, but a queasy sensation was
starting in Neville's stomach as he realized how close the Chaos
Legion had come to complete disaster. If Mr. Goyle had managed to
disrupt both Transfigurations -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Report!" snapped the Dragon General, doing his best to conceal
the fatigue he felt after casting seventeen Locking Charms, with
more yet to come.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat now dotted Gregory's forehead. "The enemy got
Dylan Vaughan," Gregory said formally. "Harry Potter and Blaise
Zabini were each Transfiguring something dark-grey and roundish, I
don't think it was finished but it looked like it would be big and
hollow, sort of cauldron-shaped. Zabini's was smaller than
Potter's. I couldn't get either of them or disrupt their
Transfigurations, Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom is on
a broomstick and he's still a terrible flyer but his aim is really
good."</p>
<p>Draco listened, frowning, and then he glanced at Padma and Dean
Thomas, who both shook their own heads, indicating that they also
couldn't think of what might be big and grey and shaped like a
cauldron.</p>
<p>"Anything else?" said Draco. If that was it, they'd lost a broom
for nothing -</p>
<p>"The only other weird thing I saw," Gregory said, sounding
puzzled, "was that some Chaotics were wearing... sort of like
goggles?"</p>
<p>Draco thought about this, not noticing that he'd stopped
marching or that all of Dragon Army had automatically stopped with
him.</p>
<p>"Was there anything special about the goggles?" Draco said.</p>
<p>"Um..." Gregory said. "They were... greenish, maybe?"</p>
<p>"Okay," said Draco. Again without thinking, he began walking
once more and his Dragons followed. "Here's our new strategy. We're
only going to send eleven Dragons against the Chaos Legion, not
fourteen. That should be enough to beat them, now that we can
neutralize their special advantage." It was a gamble, but you had
to take gambles sometimes, if you wanted to come in first in a
three-way battle.</p>
<p>"You figured out Chaos's plan, General Malfoy?" said Mr. Thomas
with considerable surprise.</p>
<p>"What <i>are</i> they doing?" said Padma.</p>
<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," said Draco, with a smirk of the
most refined smugness. "We'll just do the <i>obvious</i>
thing."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry, having now finished his cauldron, was carefully scooping
acorns into the container while the scouts searched for a nearby
source of water that could be used as a liquid base. They'd come
across frequent sinkholes and miniature creeks in the forest
before, so it ought not to take long. Another scout had brought a
straight stick that would serve as a stirrer, so Harry didn't have
to Transfigure one.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <i>what</i> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question...</p>
<p><i>How can I invoke magical powers that ought to be beyond the
reach of first-year students?</i></p>
<p>There was a cautionary tale the Potions Master had told them
(with much sneers and laughter to make the stupidity seem
low-status instead of daring and romantic) about a second-year
witch in Beauxbatons who'd stolen some extremely restricted and
expensive ingredients, and tried to brew <i>Polyjuice</i> so she
could borrow the form of another girl for purposes better left
unmentioned. Only she'd managed to contaminate the potion with
<i>cat hairs,</i> and then instead of seeking a healer immediately,
the witch had hidden herself in a bathroom, hoping the effects
would just wear off; and when she'd finally been found, it had been
too late to reverse the transformation completely, condemning her
to a life of despair as a sort of cat-girl hybrid.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't realized what that <i>meant</i> until the instant
of thinking the right question - but what that implied was that a
young wizard or witch could do things with Potions-Making that they
couldn't even come <i>close</i> to doing with Charms. Polyjuice was
one of the most potent potions known... but what made Polyjuice a
N.E.W.T.-level potion, apparently, wasn't the required age before
you had enough magical power; it was how difficult the potion was
to brew <i>precisely</i> and what happened to you if you screwed
up.</p>
<p>Nobody in any army had tried brewing any potions up until then.
But Professor Quirrell would let you get away with nearly anything,
if it was something you <i>could</i> have done in a real war.
<i>Cheating is technique,</i> the Defense Professor had once
lectured them. <i>Or rather, cheating is what the losers call
technique, and will be worth extra Quirrell points when executed
successfully.</i> In principle, there was nothing
<i>unrealistic</i> about Transfiguring a couple of cauldrons and
brewing potions out of whatever came to hand, if you had enough
time before the armies met.</p>
<p>So Harry had retrieved his copy of <i>Magical Drafts and
Potions,</i> and begun looking for a safe but useful potion he
could brew in the minutes before the battle started - a potion
which would win the battle too fast for counterspells, or produce
spell effects too strong for first-years to <i>Finite.</i></p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <i>what</i> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question...</p>
<p><i>What potion can I brew using only components gathered from an
ordinary forest?</i></p>
<p>Every recipe in <i>Magical Drafts and Potions</i> used at least
one ingredient from a magical plant or animal. Which was
unfortunate, because all the <i>magical</i> plants and animals were
in the Forbidden Forest, not the safer and lesser woods where
battles were held.</p>
<p>Someone else might have given up at that point.</p>
<p>Harry had turned the pages from one recipe to another, skimming
faster and faster in dawning realization, confirming what he had
already read and was now <i>seeing</i> for the first time.</p>
<p>Every single Potions recipe seemed to demand at least one
magical ingredient, <i>but why should that be true?</i></p>
<p>Charms required no material components at all; you just said the
words and waved your wand. Harry had been thinking about
Potions-Making as essentially analogous: Instead of your spoken
syllables triggering a spell effect for no comprehensible reason,
you collected a batch of disgusting ingredients and stirred four
times clockwise, and <i>that</i> arbitrarily triggered a spell
effect.</p>
<p>In which case, given that most potions used ordinary components
like porcupine quills or stewed slugs, you'd expect to see some
potions using <i>only</i> ordinary components.</p>
<p>But instead <i>every</i> single recipe in <i>Magical Drafts and
Potions</i> demanded at least <i>one</i> component from a magical
plant or animal - an ingredient like silk from an Acromantula or
petals from a Venus Fire Trap.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,
you didn't realize <i>what</i> you were looking at until you
happened to ask exactly the right question...</p>
<p><i>If making a potion is like casting a Charm, why don't I fall
over from exhaustion after brewing a draught as powerful as
boil-curing?</i></p>
<p>The Friday before last, Harry's double Potions class had brewed
<i>potion of boil-curing...</i> although even the most trivial
healing Charms, if you tried to cast them with wand and
incantation, were at least fourth-year spells. And afterward,
they'd all felt the way they usually felt after Potions class,
namely, <i>not</i> magically exhausted to any discernible
degree.</p>
<p>Harry had shut his copy of <i>Magical Drafts and Potions</i>
with a snap, and rushed down to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry
had found a seventh-year Ravenclaw doing his N.E.W.T. potions
homework and paid the older boy a Sickle to borrow <i>Moste Potente
Potions</i> for five minutes; because Harry hadn't wanted to run
all the way to the library to find confirmation.</p>
<p>After skimming through five recipes in the seventh-year book,
Harry had read the sixth recipe, for a <i>potion of fire
breathing</i>, which required Ashwinder eggs... and the book warned
that the resulting fire could be no hotter than the magical fire
which had spawned the Ashwinder which had laid the eggs.</p>
<p>Harry had shouted "<i>Eureka!</i>" right in the middle of the
Ravenclaw common room, and been severely rebuked by a nearby
prefect, who'd thought Mr. Potter was trying to cast a spell.
Nobody in the wizarding world knew or cared about some ancient
Muggle named Archimedes, nor the ur-physicist's realization that
the water displaced from a bathtub would equal the volume of the
object entering the bathtub...</p>
<p>Conservation laws. They'd been the critical insight in more
Muggle discoveries than Harry could easily count. In Muggle
technology you couldn't raise a feather one meter off the ground
without the power coming from <i>somewhere.</i> If you looked at
molten lava spilling from a volcano and asked where the heat came
from, a physicist would tell you about radioactive heavy metals in
the center of the Earth's molten core. If you asked where the
energy to power the radioactivity came from, the physicist would
point to an era before the Earth had formed, and a primordial
supernova in the early days of the galaxy which had baked atomic
nuclei heavier than the natural limit, the supernova compressing
protons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that yielded
back some of the supernova's energy when it split. A light bulb was
fueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a
supernova... You could play the game all the way back to the Big
Bang.</p>
<p>Magic did <i>not</i> appear to work like this, to put it mildly.
Magic's attitude toward laws like Conservation of Energy was
somewhere between a giant extended middle finger, and a shrug of
total indifference. <i>Aguamenti</i> created water out of
nothingness, so far as anyone knew; there was no known lake whose
water level went down each time. That was a simple fifth-year
spell, not considered impressive by wizards, because creating a
mere glass of water didn't seem amazing to them. They didn't have
the wacky notion that mass ought to be conserved, or that creating
a gram of mass was somehow equivalent to creating
90,000,000,000,000 joules of energy. There was an upper-year spell
Harry had run across whose <i>literal incantation</i> was
'<i>Arresto Momentum!'</i> and when Harry had asked if the momentum
went anywhere <i>else</i> he'd just gotten a puzzled look. So Harry
had kept a desperate eye out for <i>some</i> kind of conservation
principle in magic, <i>anywhere</i>...</p>
<p>...and the whole time it had been right in front of him in every
Potions class. Potions-Making didn't <i>create</i> magic, it
<i>preserved</i> magic, that was why every potion needed at least
one magical ingredient. And by following instructions like 'stir
four times counterclockwise and once clockwise' - Harry had
hypothesized - you were doing something like casting a small spell
that reshaped the magic in the ingredients. (And unbound the
physical form so that ingredients like porcupine quills dissolved
smoothly into a drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected that a
Muggle following exactly the same recipe would end up with nothing
but a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really <i>was,</i>
the art of transforming existing magical essences. So you were a
<i>little</i> tired after Potions class, but not much, because you
weren't empowering the potions yourself, you were just reshaping
magic that was already there. And that was why a second-year witch
could brew Polyjuice, or at least get close.</p>
<p>Harry had kept scanning through <i>Moste Potente Potions,</i>
looking for something that might disprove his shiny new theory.
After five minutes he'd flipped the older boy another Sickle, over
his protests, and kept going.</p>
<p>The <i>potion of giant strength</i> required a Re'em to trample
the mashed Dugbogs you stirred into the potion. It was odd, Harry
had realized after a moment, because crushed Dugbogs weren't strong
themselves, they were just... very, very crushed after the Re'em
got through with them.</p>
<p>Another recipe said to 'touch with forged bronze', i.e., grasp a
Knut in pliers so you could skim the potion's surface; and if you
dropped the Knut all the way in, the book warned, the potion would
instantly superheat and boil over the cauldron.</p>
<p>Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a
second and stranger hypothesis. Of course it wouldn't be as simple
as Potions-Making using magical potentials imbued in the
ingredients, like Muggle cars fueled by the combustion potential of
gasoline. Magic would never be as <i>sensible</i> as that...</p>
<p>And then Harry had gone to Professor Flitwick - since he didn't
want to approach Professor Snape outside of class - and Harry had
told Professor Flitwick that he wanted to invent a new potion, and
he knew what the ingredients ought to be and what the potion should
do, but he didn't know how to deduce the required stirring pattern
-</p>
<p>After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and
running in little circles, and Professor McGonagall had been called
into the ensuing fierce interrogation to promise Harry that in this
case it was both acceptable and important for him to reveal his
underlying theory, it had developed that Harry had <i>not</i> made
an original magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient
that nobody knew who had first formulated it:</p>
<p><i>A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its
ingredients.</i></p>
<p>The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the
Re'em's strength that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire
that had spawned the Ashwinder: all these potencies could be
recalled, unlocked, and restructured by the spell-like process of
stirring the ingredients in exact patterns.</p>
<p>(From a Muggle standpoint it was just <i>odd,</i> a deranged
version of thermodynamics invented by someone who thought life
ought to be <i>fair</i>. From a Muggle standpoint, the heat
expended in forging the Knut hadn't gone <i>into</i> the bronze,
the heat had <i>left</i> and dissipated into the environment,
becoming permanently less available. Energy was conserved, could be
neither created nor destroyed; <i>entropy</i> always increased. But
wizards didn't think that way: from their perspective, if you'd put
some amount of work into making a Knut, it stood to reason that you
could get exactly the same work back out. Harry had tried to
explain why this sounded a bit <i>odd</i> if you'd been raised by
Muggles, and Professor McGonagall had asked bemusedly why the
Muggle perspective was any better than the wizarding one.)</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of Potions-Making had no name and no
standard phrasing, since then you might be tempted to write it
down.</p>
<p>And someone who wasn't wise enough to figure out the principle
themselves might read it.</p>
<p>And they would start having all sorts of bright ideas for
inventing new Potions.</p>
<p>And then they would be turned into catgirls.</p>
<p>It had been made very clear to Harry that he <i>wasn't</i> going
to be sharing this particular discovery with Neville, or Hermione
either after the next armies' battle. Harry had tried to say
something about Hermione seeming really off lately and this being
just the sort of thing that might cheer her up. Professor
McGonagall had said flatly that he wasn't even to think it, and
Professor Flitwick had raised his little hands and made a gesture
as of snapping a wand in half.</p>
<p>Although the two Professors had been kind enough to suggest that
if Mr. Potter thought he knew what the potion's ingredients should
be, he might be able to find an <i>already-existing</i> recipe that
did the same thing; and Professor Flitwick had mentioned several
volumes in the Hogwarts library that might be useful...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The vast parchment-like screen now showed only an aerial view of
the forest, from which you could barely make out the camouflaged
forms of three armies, split up into two groups each, converging to
fight their three-way battle.</p>
<p>The benches of the Quidditch stadium were now rapidly filling up
with the more easily bored sort of spectator who only wanted to be
there for the final battle and skip out on all the boring points
along the way. (If there was anything wrong with Professor
Quirrell's battles, it was widely agreed, it was that his
spectacles didn't last nearly as <i>long</i> as Quidditch matches,
once they actually started. To this Professor Quirrell had replied
only, <i>Such is real life,</i> and that had been that.)</p>
<p>Within the huge window - it was all one window now, observing
from a great height - the vague collections of tiny camouflaged
forms grew closer.</p>
<p>Closer.</p>
<p>Almost touching -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The vast white parchment window showed the first touch of battle
between Sunshine and Chaos, a screaming mass of running children
with smiley-faces upon their breasts, charging forward with
<i>Contego</i> shields held high and others shouting
"<i>Somnium!</i>" -</p>
<p>Until one of their number shrieked "<i>Prismatis!</i>" in a
terrified voice and the entire charge came to a sudden halt before
the sparkling wall of force that had appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>Tracey Davis had walked out from behind the trees.</p>
<p>"That's right," said Tracey, her voice low and grim as she
leveled her wand on the barrier. "You <i>should</i> fear me. For I
am Tracey Davis, the Darke Lady! That's Darke Lady spelled
D-A-R-K-E, with an E!"</p>
<p>(Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement, was sending an inquiring look at Mr. and Mrs. Davis,
both of whom looked like they would have dearly preferred to die on
the spot.)</p>
<p>Behind the Prismatic Barrier, there was some kind of hushed
argument taking place among the Sunshine Soldiers, one of whom in
particular seemed to be getting scolded by several of the
others.</p>
<p>Then, a moment later, <i>Tracey</i> flinched.</p>
<p>Susan Bones had come to the front of the Sunshine
contingent.</p>
<p>("Goodness," said Augusta Longbottom. "What <i>do</i> you
suppose your grand-niece has been learning at Hogwarts?")</p>
<p>("I don't know," Amelia Bones said calmly, "but I shall owl her
a Chocolate Frog and instructions to learn more of it.")</p>
<p>The Prismatic Barrier vanished.</p>
<p>The Sunshine Soldiers resumed their charge forward.</p>
<p>Tracey yelled, her voice high with strain, "<i>Inflammare!</i>"
and the Sunshine charge came to another sudden halt as a line of
fire blazed up between them in the half-dry grass, extending to
follow the path of Tracey's wand as she pointed it; an instant
later Susan Bones cried "<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>" and the flames
dimmed, brightened, dimmed in the contest of their wills, other
soldiers raising their wards to aim at Tracey; and <i>that</i> was
when Neville Longbottom plunged shrieking out of the sky.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>One of the Dragon Warriors, Raymond Arnold, made a hand-sign,
pointing forward and oblique left; and there was a sudden hushed
hiss of whispers among the Dragon Army contingent as they all
quietly reoriented themselves in the direction of the enemy. The
Sunnies knew they were there, of course both armies knew; but
somehow, in this moment, they had all become instinctively
quiet.</p>
<p>The Dragons crept forward further, and then further, the dull
camouflaged forms of the Sunnies beginning to appear among the
distant trees, and still nobody spoke, nobody bellowed the call to
charge.</p>
<p>Draco was now at the forefront of his soldiers, Vincent behind
him and Padma only a shade further back; if the three of them could
take the shock of Sunshine's best, the rest of Dragon Army might
stand a chance.</p>
<p>Then Draco saw one Sunnie staring at him from the distance, in
the vanguard of her own army; staring at him with a look of fury
-</p>
<p>Across the forest battleground, their eyes met.</p>
<p>Draco had only a fraction of a second to wonder, in the back of
his mind, what Hermione Granger was so angry about, before the
shout went up from both their armies; and they were all running
forward to the charge, himself and Granger on a direct collision
course for each other.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The other Chaotics had appeared now from among the trees, some
had <i>dropped out</i> of trees, and the battle was in full force
now, everyone firing in every direction at anything that looked
like an enemy. Plus a number of Sunnies crying <i>"Luminos!</i>"
at Neville Longbottom as the Chaos Hufflepuff twisted and rocketed
up through the air on courses that could only be described as,
indeed, "chaotic" -</p>
<p>And it happened, the way it happened only one time out of twenty
in mock aerial combat, that Neville Longbottom's <i>broomstick</i>
glowed bright red beneath his clenched hands.</p>
<p>It should've meant that Longbottom was out of the game.</p>
<p>Then, in the Hogwarts stands, among the watching crowds of
students, a scream went up -</p>
<p><i>Combat realism.</i> It was Professor Quirrell's one master
rule. You could get away with anything if it was <i>realistic,</i>
and in real life, a soldier didn't just vanish when their
<i>broomstick</i> got hit by a curse.</p>
<p>Neville was falling toward the ground and screaming "<i>Chaotic
landing!</i>" and the Chaotics were wrenching their attention away
from fights to cast the Hover Charm (and run at the same time so
they wouldn't be sitting ducks), almost everyone else stopping to
gape -</p>
<p>And Neville Longbottom slammed into the leaf-laden forest
ground, landing on one knee, one foot, and both hands, as though he
were kneeling down to be knighted.</p>
<p>Everything stopped. Even Tracey and Susan paused in their
duel.</p>
<p>In the stadium, all crowd noises vanished.</p>
<p>There was a universal silence composed of astonishment, concern,
and sheer dumbstruck gaping awe, as everyone waited to see what
would happen next.</p>
<p>And then Neville Longbottom slowly rose to his feet, and leveled
his wand, still in hand, at the Sunshine Soldiers.</p>
<p>Though nobody on the battlefield heard it, a large segment of
the stadium audience had begun chanting, in steadily rising notes
each time the word was uttered, "DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM", because
you just couldn't see that and <i>not</i> think it required musical
accompaniment.</p>
<p>"The crowd is cheering your grandson," said Amelia Bones. The
old witch was favoring the screen with a measuring look.</p>
<p>"So they are," said Augusta Longbottom. "Some, if I hear
correctly, are cheering, <i>Our blood for Neville! Our souls for
Neville!</i>"</p>
<p>"Quite," said Amelia, taking a sip from a teacup which had not
been there moments earlier. "It shows the lad has leadership
potential."</p>
<p>"These cheers," continued Augusta, her voice taking on an even
more stunned quality, "seem to be coming from the Hufflepuff
benches."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> the House of the loyal, my dear," said Amelia.</p>
<p>"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore! <i>What in Merlin's
name has been happening in this school?</i>"</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy was watching the screens with an ironic smile, his
fingers tapping at his armrest in no discernible pattern. "I do not
know what is more frightening, the thought that he has some hidden
plan behind all this, or the thought that he does not."</p>
<p>"Look!" cried the Lord of Greengrass. The dapper young man had
risen half out of his chair, pointing his finger at the screen.
"There she goes!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"We'll both take him at once," Daphne whispered. She knew that a
few fear-filled minutes of real combat experience, a handful of
times each week, might not be enough to match Neville's regular
dueling practice with Harry and Cedric Diggory over the same
period. "He's too much for one of us, but both of us together -
I'll use my Charm, you just try to stun him -"</p>
<p>Hannah, beside her, nodded, and then they both screamed at the
top of their lungs and charged forward, the Hover Charms of two
supporting Sunshine Soldiers moving them faster and making them
light on their feet, Daphne already crying "<i>Tonare!</i>" even
as Hannah kept a huge <i>Contego</i> shield moving in front of
them, and with a brief extra lift they leapt over the heads of the
front screen of soldiers and landed in front of Neville with their
hair billowing high around them -</p>
<p>(Photographs were strictly prohibited at all Hogwarts games, but
somehow this moment <i>still</i> ended up on the front page of the
next day's <i>Quibbler</i>.)</p>
<p>- and in the same instant, because fighting older bullies had
burned away the slightest traces of hesitation, Hannah fired her
first Sleep Hex at Neville (she'd started the incantation while she
was still in the air) even as Daphne, concentrating more on speed
than on force, slashed down with her Ancient Blade at where she
thought Neville's thighs would be <i>after</i> he dodged -</p>
<p>But Neville leapt <i>up,</i> not sideways, leapt up higher than
he should've been able to go, so that her glowing sword cut only
the air beneath his feet. Somehow Daphne realized what it meant,
that Neville still had other Chaotics Hovering him, in time for her
to raise her Blade up over her head, but Neville <i>fell too
fast</i> and when his Blade smashed into hers it was like being hit
by a Bludger. It knocked Daphne off her feet and sent her sprawling
backward onto the grass, hitting the ground hard on her back. It
might have been all over for her, then, if Neville hadn't landed
too hard himself and gone to his knees with a pained gasp. And then
before Neville could bring his glowing Blade down, Hannah shouted
"<i>Somnium!</i>" and Neville lurched frantically backward -
though of course no spell had actually come from Hannah's wand, the
Hufflepuff girl couldn't really have fired again that fast - which
gave Daphne a second to scramble to her feet and get both hands
around her wand again -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Dear Merlin," said Lady Greengrass. Her voice seemed unsteady,
the aristocratic poise well-punctured. "My daughter is
<i>fighting</i> with the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, in her
first year. I never knew - she possessed such extraordinary talent
-"</p>
<p>"Excellent blood," Charles Nott said approvingly, causing
Augusta to snort.</p>
<p>"My good Lady," said Professor Quirrell, sounding grave. "Do not
wrong your daughter so. That is not mere <i>talent</i> which you
see." His voice grew a little dryer. "<i>That</i> is what happens
when young wizards and witches put their competitive efforts into a
game which, unlike Quidditch or Exploding Snap, involves - to put
it bluntly - actual spellcasting."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Expelliarmus!</i>" shouted Draco, trying not to let his
voice crack as he simultaneously dodged the blazing red stunbolt
that Hermione Granger had fired at him, his muscles twisting with
the need to dodge in the wrong direction - she'd pointed to his
left, and then with a mysterious twitch fired right -</p>
<p>Hermione dodged the fast-moving dueling hex, and cried with
hardly another moment's pause, "<i>Steleus!</i>", a wide-angle Hex
that Draco couldn't avoid, but he managed to point his wand at his
own face and cry "<i>Quiescus!</i>" before the sudden urge to
inhale could devolve into a sneezing fit that would've ended the
battle.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy was already half-exhausted from all the Locking
Charms and Transfigurations earlier, but his confusion was
beginning to give way to a sense of his own blood boiling, he
didn't know <i>why</i> Granger was attacking him so angrily all of
a sudden, but <i>if she wanted a fight he'd give her one -</i></p>
<p>(The Dragons and Sunnies weren't stopping to watch the duel of
their Generals, the Dragons were too disciplined to stop and watch
and that meant the Sunnies had to go on fighting too; but the
gaping audience in the Hogwarts Quidditch stands were being
distracted even from Neville and Daphne's spectacle, shifting their
eyes to the duel of two Generals as Malfoy and Granger fired hex
after hex and jinx after jinx at each other, casting more rapidly
than any other student in their year could have managed, the Dragon
General's trained dueling dance matched by the Sunshine General's
frantic energy, the combat between them beginning to resemble an
adult duel as the two most magically powerful first-years resorted
to spells more exotic than the usual Sleep Hex.)</p>
<p>- although, Draco was beginning to realize, when he and Harry
and Professor Quirrell had dismissed Miss Granger as having as much
intent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes, <i>they'd never seen her
angry.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Daphne lashed out with her Ancient Blade, again not trying to
hit hard but just moving the Blade as fast as possible, at the same
time Hannah cried "<i>Somnium!</i>" and Neville leapt back again,
but it had been another bluff and Hannah was moving in to fire a
real spell almost point-blank -</p>
<p>- and Neville Longbottom did exactly what - he would explain
afterward - Cedric Diggory had trained him to do if he was fighting
Bellatrix Black, which was to spin around and kick Hannah <i>really
hard</i> in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff girl made a sad little sound, a gasping cry of
pain, as she was knocked off her feet by the hard shoe sinking into
her abdomen with the force of Neville's whole body behind it.</p>
<p>For an instant the battlefield stood still, everything halted
except Hannah's falling form.</p>
<p>Then Neville's face turned to absolute dismay and he lowered his
wand, the Chaotic Lieutenant starting instinctively toward his
House-mate as he reached for her with his other hand -</p>
<p>Even as Hannah turned her fall into a roll and came out with her
wand raised and shot him.</p>
<p>A fractional second later, Daphne, who hadn't hesitated either,
sank her Most Ancient Blade squarely into Neville's back, causing
the Chaotic Lieutenant's muscles to jerk convulsively with the
stunning magic discharging into him even as Hannah's Sleep Hex took
effect, and then the last scion of Longbottom was sprawled still on
the ground with a look of total surprise frozen to his face.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Today Mr. Longbottom has learned a valuable lesson about his
feelings of pity and remorse," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"And chivalry," said Amelia, sipping her tea again.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Are you all right?" whispered Daphne, as she stood protectively
over where Hannah lay on the ground clutching her stomach. The girl
didn't give anything back in reply except more retching sounds that
sounded like Hannah was trying not to throw up while trying not to
cry.</p>
<p>Somehow, even though it might not have been good tactics - it
would've been better if Hannah had been hexed outright, than for
other soldiers to be tied up <i>protecting</i> her - a number of
Sunnies seemed to be standing in front of Hannah with their wands
clutched tightly, staring angrily at the Chaotics. Someone had
thrown up a Prismatic barrier between the two groups, Daphne
couldn't see who.</p>
<p>And for some reason the Chaotics didn't seem to be pressing the
attack. Even Tracey had completely dropped the grim look on her
face and was shifting her weight nervously from one foot to
another, as though she was having trouble remembering which side
she was on -</p>
<p>"<i>Hold!</i>" shouted a voice. "<i>Hold battle!</i>"</p>
<p>There wasn't much battle going on anyway, but it held.</p>
<p>General Potter, looking every inch the Boy-Who-Lived, strode out
from the trees with something large and camouflage-cloth-covered
held under one arm.</p>
<p>"Is Miss Abbott breathing all right?" General Potter yelled.</p>
<p>Daphne didn't look back. She didn't trust that this wasn't a
trap - it was absolutely certain that if the Chaotics took the
opportunity to attack, Professor Quirrell would not only rule it
legal but also award them extra points afterward. But Daphne could
hear the answer well enough with her ears, it wasn't like Hannah
was trying to breathe <i>quietly</i>, and so she said, "Sort
of."</p>
<p>"She should get out of here and to someone who can use healing
Charms," Harry said. "Just in case that broke something."</p>
<p>From behind Daphne, a small gasping voice said, "I - can - still
- fight -"</p>
<p>"Miss Abbott, don't -" Harry said, just as there was the sound
from behind Daphne of someone collapsing back to the grass after
trying and failing to get to her feet. Everyone winced, but Daphne
didn't turn her back on Harry.</p>
<p>"Why haven't the teachers stopped the battle?" said Susan, her
voice angry.</p>
<p>"I expect it's because Miss Abbott is in no danger of permanent
damage and Professor Quirrell thinks we're learning valuable
lessons," Harry said in a hard voice. "Look, Miss Abbott, if you
go, Tracey will also retire from the battle. You already outnumber
us, so that's a very good deal for your side. Please take it."</p>
<p>"Hannah, just <i>go!</i>" said Daphne. "I mean, just say you're
out!"</p>
<p>When Daphne glanced back she saw that Hannah was shaking her
head, still curled up in a ball on the grass.</p>
<p>"Oh, screw this," said Harry. "<i>Chaotics! The faster we stun
them, the faster she's out of here! We're going to do this very
quickly, even if we take casualties! End truce! TUNAFISH!</i>"</p>
<p>Daphne's political hindbrain had only an instant to admire how
Harry's few words had just made the Chaotics the <i>good</i> guys,
and then in almost perfect unison, the Chaotics were plunging their
hands into the pockets of their uniforms and drawing out green
sunglasses in an unfamiliar style. Not like anything you would wear
to the beach, more like goggles for advanced Potions -</p>
<p>Then Daphne realized what was about to happen and snapped up her
other hand to shield her eyes, just as Harry ripped the cloth off
the cauldron.</p>
<p>The fluid that spilled forth as Harry Potter threw the
cauldron's contents into the air was too bright to be seen, too
brilliant to be imagined, incandescent like the Sun magnified a
dozen times -</p>
<p>(which was exactly what it was)</p>
<p>(the sunlight which had been invested to create the acorns, the
bright energy that had fueled a tree rising up from the bare
dirt)</p>
<p>(blazing a searing purple, the color of the mixed blue and red
wavelengths that chlorophyll absorbed)</p>
<p>(with almost none of the green wavelengths that chlorophyll
reflected to create the green color of leaves)</p>
<p>(which was the color of the Chaos Legion's sunglasses, made to
pass through green wavelengths, blocking red and blue, reducing
even the most incandescent purple glare to something bearable)</p>
<p>- the violet light blazed on and on, Daphne tried dropping her
arm from her eyes but found that she couldn't look directly at
<i>anything,</i> even the secondhand purple glare was so bright she
had to squint; and she had only time to cry one <i>Finite
Incantatem,</i> which didn't work, before a Sleep Hex took her.</p>
<p>What was left of the battle didn't take very long after
that.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"NOW!" bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly of Sunshine, now
commanding a detachment of Chaos Legionnaires. "I mean, TUNAFISH!"
The Slytherin boy's hand grasped the cloth shielding the cauldron
from the triggering touch of daylight, already beginning to move it
aside.</p>
<p>"NOW!" bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly of Chaos, commanding a
consignment of Dragon Warriors. "DO WHATEVER THEY DO!"</p>
<p>The Chaotics of Zabini's detachment plunged their hands into
their uniform pockets, and came forth bearing green sunglasses
-</p>
<p>- an action almost perfectly mirrored by Dean and the Dragon
Warriors, who drew forth green-colored Potions goggles, and quickly
drew the straps over their own heads, even as the Chaotics put on
their sunglasses and the violet incandescence blasted forth.</p>
<p>(As General Malfoy had explained, if Mr. Goyle reported that the
Chaos Legion was wearing green-colored Potions goggles, you didn't
have to know <i>why</i> to Transfigure some copies.)</p>
<p>"THAT'S CHEATING!" shrieked Blaise Zabini.</p>
<p>"THAT'S TECHNIQUE!" Dean yelled back. "DRAGONS, CHARGE!"</p>
<p>("Pardon me," the Lady Greengrass said. "Could you stop
<i>laughing</i> like that, Mr. Quirrell? It's unnerving.")</p>
<p>"FINITE THEIR GOGGLES!" shouted Blaise Zabini, as the two armies
ran headlong toward each other through omnipresent eye-searing
purple glare. "WE CAN STILL WIN!"</p>
<p>"YOU HEARD HIM!" bellowed Dean. "GET THEIR GLASSES!"</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini's reply to this wasn't anything articulate.</p>
<p>That battle went on a lot longer.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>" shrieked the Sunshine General.</p>
<p>Draco didn't dodge, he didn't counter, he didn't have enough
energy left for either, all he could do was whip his left hand into
position and hope -</p>
<p>The red stunbolt dissipated again on Draco's
<i>Colloportused</i> glove, which he'd Transfigured and
spell-locked to his hand the same as the rest of Dragon Army. It
was all that was saving him now, that shield.</p>
<p>It should have been a time to counterattack, but Draco could
only catch his breath, as the two of them danced backward and
forward beneath the trees in the never-ending movements of their
duel. Across from him, General Granger was panting hard, the young
girl's face glistening with sweat like dew, her chestnut hair
wetted into brown plaits. Her camouflage uniform was stained with
damp spots, her shoulders visibly trembling with exhaustion, but
her wand was still steel-steady where it stayed level on Draco
through all their motion. Her eyes glaring, her cheeks flushed with
rage.</p>
<p><i>So, little girl, why're you pretending to fight like a
grownup today?</i></p>
<p>The taunt came to mind, but he didn't really think he needed
Granger any angrier; so instead Draco just said - though he could
hear his own voice cracking - "Any reason you're feeling mad at me,
Granger?"</p>
<p>The girl was gasping for breath herself, her own voice wobbling
as she spoke. "I know what you're up to," said Hermione Granger,
her voice rising. "I know what you and Snape are up to, Malfoy, and
I know who's behind it!"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Draco said without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>That only seemed to increase Granger's fury, and her fingers
whitened on the wand she held leveled on him.</p>
<p>And then Draco got it, and it boiled his own blood in his veins.
Even <i>she</i> thought he was secretly plotting against her -</p>
<p>"<i>You too?</i>" Draco yelled. "<i>I helped you, you
bucktoothed bint! You, you, you," -</i> stuttering past all the
Dark curses that came to mind until he found something he could
actually cast at her - "<i>DENSAUGEO!</i>"</p>
<p>But Granger flashed and whirled around the Tooth-Lengthening
Hex, and then her own wand came around and leveled at almost
point-blank range, even as Draco brought up his left hand like a
shield, placing the magic-locked glove between himself and whatever
she was about to fire, and the Sunshine General's own voice rose to
a shriek audible across the whole battleground -</p>
<p>"<i>ALOHOMORA!</i>"</p>
<p>Time should have paused.</p>
<p>But it didn't.</p>
<p>Instead the padlocked glove on Draco's hand flashed briefly
grey, and then the padlock clicked and fell off.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>The screens showed it all very clearly, to the entire watching
Hogwarts stadium.</p>
<p>And the bone-dead-silent hush that fell over every bench in
every bleacher said that everyone understood quite clearly what it
meant, that the scion of House Malfoy had just had his magic
overcome by a Muggleborn.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger didn't pause in her fight, gave no sign that
she even knew what she'd done; instead her foot snapped out in a
Muggle-style kick that knocked Draco's wand cleanly out of his
hand, his shocked mind and body moving just a little too slowly.
Draco dove after his wand, scrabbling frantically on the ground,
but from behind him a girl's cracking voice said "<i>Somnium!</i>"
and Draco Malfoy fell and didn't rise again.</p>
<p>There was another moment of frozen silence. The Sunshine General
was wobbling on her feet, looking like she might faint.</p>
<p>Then the Dragon Warriors screamed at the top of their lungs and
charged forward to avenge their fallen commander.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Davis were shaking as they stood up from the
comfortable chairs of the faculty Quidditch box; they couldn't
quite clutch each other while walking, but they held hands tightly,
pretending hard to be invisible. If they'd been children young
enough for accidental magic they probably would've spontaneously
Disillusioned themselves.</p>
<p>The elderly Charles Nott said nothing as he stood from his
chair. The scarred Lord Jugson said nothing, as he stood from his
own chair.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy said nothing as he stood.</p>
<p>All three of them turned without pause and strode toward the
stairwell of the elevated bleachers, moving in eerie unison like an
Auror trio -</p>
<p>"Lord Malfoy," the Defense Professor said in mild tones. That
man was still seated in his own chair, looking upon his
parchment-like screens, arms limp at his side, as though for some
reason he didn't feel like moving.</p>
<p>The white-haired man halted just before reaching the exit
archway, and the elderly man and the scarred man halted as well,
flanking him. Lord Malfoy's head turned, too slightly to be any
form of acknowledgement, but in the Defense Professor's
direction.</p>
<p>"Your son performed exceptionally well today," said Professor
Quirrell. "I must confess that I underestimated him. And he has
earned his army's loyalty, as you have witnessed." Still very mild,
the Defense Professor's voice. "Speaking as your son's teacher, it
is my opinion that he will not benefit if you interfere in his
-"</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy and his compatriots vanished down the stairs.</p>
<p>"A fine try, Quirinus," Dumbledore said quietly. The old
wizard's face showed small lines of worry; he hadn't risen from his
own seat either, staring at the parchment screens as though they
were still active. "Do you think he will listen?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's shoulders twitched in a slight shrug,
the only movement they'd shown since the battle ended.</p>
<p>"<i>Well</i>," said the Lady Greengrass, as she rose up and
cracked her knuckles, stretching, her husband silent beside her. "I
must say, that was quite... interesting..."</p>
<p>Amelia Bones had risen from her own cushioned seat without any
fuss. "Interesting indeed," said Director Bones. "I do confess, I
find myself disturbed by the skill with which those children were
fighting one another."</p>
<p>"The skill?" Lord Greengrass said. "Their spells didn't seem all
that impressive to me. Except for Daphne's, of course."</p>
<p>The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing at
the Defense Professor's balding head. "The Stunning Hex is not a
first-year spell, Lord Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had
in mind. They supported each other with those simple spells, they
reacted at speed to surprises..." The Director of the DMLE paused,
as though searching for words that a mere civilian could
understand. "In the midst of battle," she said finally, "with
spells flying in every direction... those children seemed quite at
home."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Director Bones," said the Defense Professor. "Some arts
are best begun in youth."</p>
<p>The old witch's eyes narrowed. "You are readying them to become
a military force, Professor. To what end?"</p>
<p>"Now hold on!" interjected Lord Greengrass. "There's plenty of
schools where they teach dueling in first year!"</p>
<p>"Dueling?" said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn't
visible if the pale face was smiling. "That is <i>nothing</i>, Lord
Greengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not
to hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have
learned to adapt when combat conditions change and change again.
They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those
who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued.
They have learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some
have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass,
<i>these</i> wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be
protected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they
know how to fight."</p>
<p>Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped her hands together three
times.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>We won.</i></p>
<p>It was the first thing Draco heard when he woke up on the
battlefield, Padma telling him how his soldiers had rallied after
he fell. How, thanks to the Dragon General's foresight, Mr. Thomas
had led his detachment to victory over Chaos. How General Potter
had defeated the portion of the Sunshine Regiment that clashed with
him. How Mr. Thomas's Dragon Warriors had rejoined the main body of
soldiers bearing both their own goggles and the sunglasses of the
defeated Chaotics. How, only moments later, General Potter's
remaining contingent had attacked both other armies with a potion
that emitted searing purple light. But Dragon had held the
numerical advantage over Sunshine and Chaos both, and enough
sunglasses for their warriors; and so Padma had managed to lead her
inherited army to victory.</p>
<p>From the light in Padma's eyes and her arrogant smile that would
have done proud to a Malfoy, she was expecting congratulations.
Draco managed to grit out some form of praise from between his
clenched teeth, and couldn't have said afterward what it was. The
foreign-born witch, it appeared, hadn't any idea what'd happened,
or what it meant.</p>
<p><i>I lost.</i></p>
<p>The Dragons trudged back to Hogwarts beneath gray skies, cold
droplets landing heavy on Draco's skin, one by one. While he'd been
stunned, it had begun, the long-promised rain finally beginning to
fall. There was only one option left to Draco now. A forced move,
as Mr. MacNair, who'd taught Draco chess, would have termed it.
Harry Potter probably wouldn't like it, if he really was in love
with Granger the way everyone said. But the forced move, as Mr.
MacNair had defined it, was one you needed to make if you wanted
the game to continue at all.</p>
<p>It kept on playing in Draco's mind, over and over again, even as
he walked like an automaton through the massive portals of
Hogwarts, sent away Vincent and Gregory with two sharp words, and
became alone within his private bedroom, sitting on his bed,
staring at the wall above his desk. Filling his mind like a
Dementor had locked him into the memory.</p>
<p>The grey flash coming from his glove, the lock clicking and
falling away -</p>
<p>Draco knew, he <i>knew</i> what he'd done wrong. He'd been so
tired after casting twenty-seven Locking Charms for all the other
Dragon Warriors. Less than a minute wasn't enough time to recover
after each spell. And so he'd <i>just</i> cast <i>Colloportus</i>
on his own padlocked glove, <i>just</i> cast the spell, not put in
all his strength to bind it stronger than Harry Potter or Hermione
Granger could undo.</p>
<p>But nobody was going to <i>believe</i> that, even if it was
true. Even in Slytherin, nobody would believe that. It
<i>sounded</i> like an excuse, and an excuse was all that anyone
would hear.</p>
<p><i>Granger whirled and spun and screamed 'ALOHOMORA!'</i> -</p>
<p>Draco's mind kept playing it over and over as the resentment
built. He'd <i>helped</i> Granger - cooperated with her on banning
traitors - held her hand as she'd dangled off the roof - stopped a
riot from breaking out around her in the Great Hall - did she have
any idea what he'd <i>risked,</i> what he'd probably already
<i>lost</i>, what it meant for the heir of <i>House Malfoy</i> to
do that for a <i>mudblood</i> -</p>
<p>And now there was only one move left, and the thing about a
forced move was that you <i>had</i> to make it, even if it meant
getting detention and losing House points. Professor Snape would
certainly <i>understand</i> but there were limits (Father had
warned him) to what Snape would overlook.</p>
<p>Challenge Granger to a wizard's duel, in open defiance of
Hogwarts regulations. Attack her outright, if she tried to refuse.
Defeat her one-on-one, in public, not with clever dueling
technique, but by <i>overpowering</i> her magic. Beat her solidly,
completely, <i>crush</i> her as utterly as the Dark Lord himself
had crushed his enemies. Make it absolutely clear to everyone, so
that nobody could possibly doubt, that Draco had just been
exhausted from casting the spell so many times. Prove that the
Malfoy blood was stronger than any mudblood's -</p>
<p><i>Only it's not,</i> Harry Potter's voice whispered inside
Draco's mind. <i>It's easy to forget what's really true, Draco,
once you start trying to win at politics. But in reality there's
only one thing that makes you a wizard, remember?</i></p>
<p>Draco knew, then, he knew the reason for the disquiet in the
back of his mind, as he stared at the blank wall above his desk
contemplating his forced move. It should've been simple - when you
only had one move, the thing to do was make it - but -</p>
<p><i>Granger whirling, spinning, sweat-dampened hair flying around
her, bolts flying from her wand as fast as his own, jinx and
counter-jinx, glowing bats flying at his face, and through all of
it the look of fury in Granger's eyes -</i></p>
<p>There'd been a part of him <i>admiring</i> that, before it had
all gone wrong, admiring Granger's fury and power; a part of him
that had exulted in the first <i>real</i> fight he'd ever been in,
against...</p>
<p>...his first equal opponent.</p>
<p>If he challenged Granger, and <i>lost...</i></p>
<p>It ought not to be possible, Draco had gotten his wand two full
years before anyone else in his Hogwarts class.</p>
<p>Only there was a <i>reason</i> why they usually didn't bother
giving wands to nine-year-olds. Age counted too, it wasn't just how
long you'd held a wand. Granger's birthday had been only a few days
into the year, when Harry had bought her that pouch. That meant she
was twelve now, that she'd been twelve almost since the start of
Hogwarts. And the truth was, Draco hadn't been practicing much
outside of class, probably not nearly as much as Hermione Granger
of Ravenclaw. Draco hadn't thought he <i>needed</i> any more
practice to stay ahead...</p>
<p><i>And Granger was exhausted too,</i> whispered the Voice of
Contrary Evidence inside him. Granger must have been exhausted from
all those Stunning Hexes, and even in that state she'd been able to
undo his Locking Charm.</p>
<p>And Draco <i>could not</i> afford to challenge Granger publicly,
one-on-one with no excuses, and <i>lose.</i></p>
<p>Draco knew what you were supposed to do in this sort of
situation. You were supposed to cheat. But if anyone discovered
Draco cheating, it would be <i>disastrous</i>, perfect blackmail
material even if it never got out publicly, and any Slytherins
watching would <i>know</i> that, they'd be <i>looking...</i></p>
<p>And then, if you were watching, you would have seen Draco Malfoy
get up from his bed, and go to his desk, and take out a sheet of
the finest sheepskin parchment, and a pearl-carven inkwell, filled
with greenish-silver ink that had been made with true silver and
crushed emeralds. From the great trunk at his bed's foot, the
Slytherin drew forth a book bound also in silver and emeralds,
entitled <i>The Etiquette of the Houses of Britain.</i> And with a
new, clean quill, Draco Malfoy began to write, frequently looking
to the book where it lay open as a reference. There was a grim
smile on the boy's face, making the young Malfoy look very much
like his father, as he carefully drew each letter as though it were
a separate artwork.</p>
<p><i>From Draco, son of Lucius son of Abraxis Lords of the Noble
and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, son also of Narcissa daughter of
Druella Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, scion
and heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy:</i></p>
<p><i>To Hermione, the first Granger:</i></p>
<p>(That form might have been meant to sound polite, long ago when
it had been invented; nowadays, after centuries of being used to
address mudbloods, it carried a lovely tinge of refined venom.)</p>
<p><i>I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, for</i></p>
<p>Draco paused, carefully moving the quill aside so that it
wouldn't drip. He needed a pretext for this, at least if he wanted
to impose the duel's conditions. The challenged had the choice of
terms, <i>unless</i> they had insulted a Noble House. He needed to
make it look like Granger had insulted him...</p>
<p>What was he thinking? Granger <i>had</i> insulted him.</p>
<p>Draco flipped the book to the page of standard formulae, and
found one that seemed appropriate.</p>
<p><i>I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, for that I
have thrice over helped you and offered you only my goodwill, and
in return you <u>falsely</u> accused me of plotting against
you,</i></p>
<p>Draco had to stop and take a breath, forcing down the seething
anger; he was starting to genuinely <i>feel</i> the insult now, and
he'd just written out the last phrase and underlined it without
thinking, like it was an ordinary letter. After a moment's
reflection, he decided to let it stand; it might not be the exact
formal phrasing but it had a raw, angry tone that seemed
appropriate.</p>
<p><i>which insult you committed before the eyes of
Britain.</i></p>
<p><i>Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law,
by</i></p>
<p>"The seventeenth ruling of the thirty-first Wizengamot," Draco
said aloud without looking, a line delivered in many plays; he sat
straighter as he said it, feeling every pulse of the noble blood in
his veins.</p>
<p><i>Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by
the 17th ruling of the 31st Wizengamot, to meet me in wizard's duel
with terms: That we each come alone and in silence, speaking to
none before or after,</i></p>
<p>If the duel went poorly, Draco could just say nothing and leave
it at that. And if he did defeat Granger, he would have learned
experimentally that he could beat her <i>again</i> in a public
challenge. It wasn't cheating, but it was Science, which was almost
as good.</p>
<p><i>contesting by magic solely, without death or lasting
injury,</i></p>
<p>...where? Draco had been told about a room in Hogwarts that was
good for duels, where everything valuable was already protected by
wards, and there were no portraits to tattle on you... which one
had it been again...</p>
<p><i>in the trophy room of the Castle of the Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry,</i></p>
<p>And their <i>second</i> and public duel had better be
<i>soon</i>, like tomorrow, it would take very little time for his
reputation in Slytherin to go irretrievably to sludge. He needed to
fight Granger for the first time <i>tonight</i>.</p>
<p><i>upon midnight's stroke that shall end this very day.</i></p>
<p><i>Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy.</i></p>
<p>Draco signed the formal parchment, and then drew forth his
ordinary and lesser parchment, and his regular ink, for his post
scriptum:</p>
<p><i>If you don't know how the rules work, Granger, here's how it
is. You insulted a Most Ancient House, and I've got the lawful
right to challenge. And if you affront the conditions of the duel,
like by having Flitwick show up at the trophy room, or even just
telling anyone else, my father will take you and your false honor
straight to the Wizengamot.</i></p>
<p><i>Draco Malfo</i></p>
<p>On the last letter his quill pressed down on the parchment so
viciously that the nib snapped off, creating a streak of ink and a
small rip in the parchment, which Draco decided also looked
appropriate.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>That night at dinnertime, Susan Bones came to Harry Potter and
told him that she thought Draco Malfoy was going to carry out his
plot against Hermione very soon. She was warning all the members of
S.P.H.E.W., and she'd warned Professor Sprout, and she'd warned
Professor Flitwick, and she was going to send a letter to her Aunt
tonight, and now she was warning Harry Potter, too. Only they
couldn't quite talk about it with Padma - Susan said, looking very
serious - because Padma was feeling torn between her loyalty to
Hermione and her loyalty to her General.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, who was at this point feeling
more frustrated with the entire situation than anything really
<i>productive</i>, snapped at her that <i>yes</i>, he knew
something had to be done.</p>
<p>After Susan Bones left, Harry looked over at the other end of
the Ravenclaw table, where Hermione had sat down away from him or
Padma or Anthony or any of her other friends.</p>
<p>But Hermione didn't look like she was in a mood where somebody
going over and bothering her would be taken very well.</p>
<p>Later, looking backward, Harry would think of how, in his SF and
fantasy novels, people always made their big, important choices for
big, important reasons. Hari Seldon had built his Foundation to
rebuild the ashes of the Galactic Empire, rather than because he
would look more important if he could be in charge of his own
research group. Raistlin Majere had severed ties with his brother
because he wanted to become a god, not because he was incompetent
at personal relationships and unwilling to take advice on how to do
better. Frodo Baggins had taken the Ring because he was a hero who
wanted to save Middle-Earth, not because it would've been too
awkward not to. If anyone ever wrote a true history of the world -
not that anyone ever could or would - probably 97% of all the key
moments of Fate would turn out to be constructed of lies and tissue
paper and trivial little thoughts that somebody could've just as
easily thought differently.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger,
where she'd sat down at the other end of the table, and felt a
sense of reluctance to bother her when she looked like she was
already in a bad mood.</p>
<p>So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk
to Draco Malfoy first, just so that he could absolutely positively
definitely assure Hermione that Draco really wasn't plotting
against her.</p>
<p>And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherin
basement and was told by Vincent that <i>the boss ain't to be
disturbed</i>... then Harry <i>thought</i> that maybe he should see
if Hermione would talk to him right away. That he should just get
started on unraveling the whole mess before it raveled any further.
Harry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had
just found a clever excuse to put off something
unenjoyable-but-necessary.</p>
<p>He actually thought that.</p>
<p>And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he'd just
talk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday
breakfast, and <i>then</i> talk to Hermione.</p>
<p>Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was Sunday morning, on the 5th of April, 1992, and the
simulated sky above the Great Hall of Hogwarts showed great
torrents of rain pouring down in such density that the lightning
flashes were diminished and scattered into small pulses of white
light that sometimes transformed the House tables, paling their
faces and making all the students appear briefly to be ghosts.</p>
<p>Harry sat at the Ravenclaw table, wearily eating a waffle,
waiting for Draco to make an appearance so that he could get
started on sorting this whole thing out. There was a
<i>Quibbler</i> being passed around which had somehow ended up with
Hannah and Daphne on the front page, but it hadn't gotten to his
place yet.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Harry finished eating his waffle, and then
looked around <i>again</i> to see if Draco had arrived yet for
breakfast at the Slytherin table.</p>
<p>It was odd.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy was almost never late.</p>
<p>Since Harry was looking in the direction of the Slytherin table,
he didn't see Hermione Granger entering through the huge doors of
the Great Hall. Thus he was rather startled when he turned back and
discovered Hermione sitting down directly beside him at the
Ravenclaw table, just as if she hadn't not-done that for more than
a week.</p>
<p>"Hi, Harry," Hermione said, her voice sounding almost exactly
normal. She started to put toast on her plate and a selection of
healthy fruits and vegetables. "How are you?"</p>
<p>"Within one standard deviation of my own peculiar little
average," Harry automatically replied. "How are <i>you</i> doing?
Did you sleep okay?"</p>
<p>There were dark bags under Hermione Granger's eyes.</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I'm fine," said Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. He took a slice of pie onto his plate (as his
brain was occupied with other things, Harry's hand simply took the
tastiest thing within range, without evaluating complex concepts
like whether he was ready to eat dessert). "Um, Hermione, I'm going
to need to talk to you later today, is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Hermione. "Why wouldn't it be?"</p>
<p>"Because -" Harry said. "I mean - you and I <i>haven't</i> - for
the last few days -"</p>
<p><i>Shut up,</i> suggested an internal part of Harry that seemed
to have been recently allocated for governing Hermione-related
issues.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger didn't look like she was paying much attention
to him in any case. She just stared down at her plate, and then,
after about ten seconds of awkward silence, began to eat her tomato
slices, one after another, without pause.</p>
<p>Harry looked away from her and began to eat a slice of pie
which, he discovered, had somehow materialized on his plate.</p>
<p>"So!" Hermione Granger suddenly said after she'd polished off
most of her plate in silence. "Anything happening today?"</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. He looked around frantically, as though to
find something-happening that he could use as conversational
fodder.</p>
<p>And so Harry was one of the first to see it, and wordlessly
point, although the sudden swell of whispers that swept through the
Great Hall showed that a number of other people had seen it
too.</p>
<p>The distinctive crimson tinge of the robes would have been
recognizable anywhere, but it still took Harry's brain a few
moments to place the faces. An Asianish-looking man, solemn, and
today looking rather grim. A man with a piercing gaze that swept
over the room, his long black hair waving behind him in a ponytail.
A man thin and pale and unshaven, with a face so blank that it was
like stone. It took Harry a few moment to place the faces, and
remember the names, from that long-ago day in January when the
Dementor had come to Hogwarts: <i>Komodo, Butnaru,
Goryanof.</i></p>
<p>"An Auror trio?" Hermione said in a strange bright voice. "Why,
I wonder what they'd be doing here."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was in their company as well, looking as worried as
Harry had ever seen him; and after a moment's pause while the old
wizard's eyes scanned the Great Hall and the students whispering
over their breakfasts, he pointed -</p>
<p>- straight at Harry.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>now</i> what," Harry said under his breath. His inward
thoughts were a lot more panicked than that, as he wondered
frantically if anyone had connected him to the Azkaban breakout
somehow. He looked at the Head Table, trying to make the glance
casual, and realized that Professor Quirrell was nowhere to be
seen, this morning -</p>
<p>The Aurors swept toward him with swift strides, Auror Goryanof
approaching from the other side of the Ravenclaw table as though to
block any escape in that direction, Auror Komodo and Auror Butnaru
approaching from Harry's side, the Headmaster following straight on
Komodo's heels.</p>
<p>All conversation everywhere had ground to utter silence.</p>
<p>The Aurors reached Harry's place at the table, surrounding him
from three angles.</p>
<p>"Yes?" Harry said, as normally as he could. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger," Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice, "you
are under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="79">Chapter 79</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt
1</h3>
<p><i>"Hermione Granger," Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice,
"you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco
Malfoy."</i></p>
<p>The words dropped into Harry's consciousness and shattered his
thoughts into a hundred shards of incredulity, the shock of
adrenaline running into so much confusion that -</p>
<p>"She -" Harry said. "She - she wouldn't - WHAT?"</p>
<p>The Aurors weren't paying any attention to him. Komodo spoke
again, still in that colorless voice. "Mr. Malfoy has regained
consciousness in St. Mungo's and named you, Hermione Granger, as
his assaulter. He has repeated these accusations under two drops of
Veritaserum. The Blood-Cooling Charm you cast upon Mr. Malfoy would
have killed him if he had not been found and treated, and it must
be presumed known to you that this was a fatal curse. I therefore
arrest you upon the serious charge of attempted murder and you will
be taken into Ministry custody to be interrogated under three drops
of Veritaserum -"</p>
<p>"<i>Are you mad?</i>" the words burst out of Harry's mouth, as
he shoved himself up from the Ravenclaw table, an instant before
Auror Butnaru's hand clamped down hard upon his shoulder. Harry
ignored it. "That's <i>Hermione Granger</i> you're trying to
arrest, the nicest girl in Ravenclaw, she helps Hufflepuffs with
their homework, she'd <i>die</i> before she tried to kill <i>anyone
-</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione Granger's face had crumpled. "I did it," she whispered
in a tiny voice. "It was me."</p>
<p>Another huge rock fell on Harry's thoughts and crushed their
fragile order, bursting fragments of comprehension into dust.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face seemed to have aged decades over the course of
seconds. "Why, Miss Granger?" Dumbledore said, his own voice barely
above a whisper. "Why would you do such a thing?"</p>
<p>"I'm," Hermione said, "I'm, I'm - sorry - I don't know why I -"
She seemed to collapse in on herself, her voice was formed of
nothing but sobs, and the only words that could be made out were,
"I thought - killed him - sorry -"</p>
<p>And Harry should have said something, should have done
something, should have jumped up out of his seat and stunned all
three Aurors and then gone on to some incredibly clever next move,
but the twice-shattered fragments of his thought processes could
yield no output. Butnaru's hand pushed Harry gently but firmly back
into his seat and Harry found himself <i>stuck</i> there like he'd
been glued, he tried to grab his wand for a <i>Finite</i> and it
wouldn't come out of his pocket, the three Aurors and Dumbledore
escorted Hermione out of the Great Hall amid a rising storm of
outcries and the doors began to swing shut behind them - nothing
made sense, it was surreal beyond all reckoning, like he'd been
transported into an alternate universe, and then Harry's mind
flashed back to another day of confusion and in a moment of
desperate inspiration he finally realized what the Weasley twins
had done to Rita Skeeter, and his voice rose in a scream,
"<i>HERMIONE YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU'VE BEEN
FALSE-MEMORY-CHARMED!"</i></p>
<p>But the doors had already shut.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva couldn't possibly have stood still, she paced back and
forth through the Headmaster's office, the back of her mind
half-expecting Severus or Harry to tell her to shut up and sit
down, but neither the Potions Master or the Boy-Who-Lived seemed
much concerned with her, both of their gazes focused on Albus
Dumbledore where he had emerged from the Floo. There were sounds in
the background that nobody heard. Severus seemed as passionless as
ever, sitting in a small cushioned chair beside the Headmaster's
desk. The old wizard stood terrible and upright by the
still-burning fireplace, robed in black like a starless night,
radiating power and dismay. All her own thoughts were of utter
confusion and horror. Harry Potter sat on a wooden stool with his
fingers gripping the seat, and his eyes were fury and freezing
ice.</p>
<p>At 6:33am, Quirinus Quirrell had Flooed St. Mungo's from his
office for immediate pickup of Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had
found Mr. Malfoy in the trophy room of Hogwarts, on the verge of
death from the continuing effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm slowly
lowering his body temperature. Professor Quirrell had immediately
dispelled the Charm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr. Malfoy, and
levitated him to his office to Floo him to St. Mungo's for further
treatment. After this, Professor Quirrell had informed the
Headmaster, stating the facts briefly before vanishing through the
Floo; the Aurors, notified by St. Mungo's, had demanded his
presence for questioning.</p>
<p>The clear intent of the Blood-Cooling Charm had been to kill
Draco Malfoy so slowly that the wards of Hogwarts, set to detect
sudden injury, would not trigger. Under interrogation, Professor
Quirrell had told the Aurors that he had cast several tracking
Charms upon Mr. Malfoy's person in January, shortly after Mr.
Malfoy's return to Hogwarts from Yuletime break. Professor Quirrell
had cast tracking Charms because he had learned of a person with a
motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had refused to
identify this person. The tracking Charms which Professor Quirrell
had cast were triggered by Mr. Malfoy's health falling below an
absolute level, rather than by sudden changes, and had therefore
alerted Professor Quirrell before Mr. Malfoy had died.</p>
<p>Two drops of Veritaserum, sufficient to prevent Mr. Malfoy from
withholding any meliorating or moderating information in his
statements, had shown that Mr. Malfoy had - legally under the laws
of Noble Houses, illegally under the regulations of Hogwarts -
challenged Hermione Granger to a duel. Mr. Malfoy had won the duel
but had then, as he left, been attacked from behind by Miss Granger
with a Stunning Hex. After this Mr. Malfoy knew nothing.</p>
<p>Three drops of Veritaserum, requiring her to volunteer all
relevant information, had caused Hermione Granger to confess that
she had stunned Draco Malfoy from behind, and then, in a fit of
anger, cast the Blood-Cooling Charm on him, with the deliberate
intention of killing him slowly enough to evade identification from
the Hogwarts wards, whose workings she had read about in
<i>Hogwarts: A History</i>. She had been horrified at herself upon
awakening the next morning, but had not told anyone of what she'd
done, believing Draco Malfoy to be already dead - as he certainly
would have been after seven hours, had his body's own magic not
been resisting the effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm.</p>
<p>"Her trial," said Albus Dumbledore, "is set for tomorrow at
noon."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" the word burst out of Harry Potter. The
Boy-Who-Lived didn't rise from his chair, but Minerva saw his
fingers whiten where they gripped the wooden seat beneath him.
"That's insane! You can't do a police investigation in one day
-"</p>
<p>The Potions Master raised his voice. "This is not <i>Muggle</i>
Britain, Mr. Potter!" Severus's face was as expressionless as ever,
but the bite in his voice was sharp. "The Aurors have an accusation
under Veritaserum and a confession under Veritaserum. So far as
they are concerned, the investigation is <i>done</i>."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said Dumbledore, just as Harry seemed ready to
explode. "I have insisted to Amelia that this matter be given the
utmost scrutiny. Unfortunately, as the ill-fated duel was at
midnight -"</p>
<p>"<i>Supposed</i> duel," Harry said sharply.</p>
<p>"As the <i>supposed</i> duel was at midnight - yes, you're quite
right, Harry - it is beyond the range of any Time-Turner -"</p>
<p>"Also <i>supposedly</i>," the Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. "And
rather <i>suspiciously</i>, since the alleged murder suspect
doesn't know about Time-Turners. I hope that an invisible Auror was
immediately sent back in time as far as possible to observe -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore inclined his head. "I went <i>myself,</i> Harry, the
moment I heard. But by the time I reached the trophy room, Mr.
Malfoy was already unconscious and Miss Granger had gone -"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry Potter. "You reached the trophy room and saw
Draco unconscious. That is all you observed, Headmaster. You did
not <i>observe</i> Hermione there, or watch her leave. Let us
distinguish observation from inference." The boy's head turned to
look at her. "Imperius, Obliviation, False Memory Charm,
Legilimency. Professor McGonagall, am I leaving out any
mind-affecting spell that could have made Hermione do this or make
her believe she'd done it?"</p>
<p>"The Confundus Charm," she said. And the Dark Arts had never
been her study, but she knew - "And certain Dark rituals. But none
of those could be performed in Hogwarts without alarm."</p>
<p>The boy nodded, his eyes still directly addressing her. "Which
of those spells can be detected? Which would the Aurors try to
detect?"</p>
<p>"The Confundus Charm would wear off in a few hours," she said,
after a moment to gather her thoughts. "Miss Granger would remember
the Imperius. Obliviation cannot be detected by any known means,
but only a Professor could have cast that spell upon a student
without alarm from the Hogwarts wards. Legilimency - can only be
detected by another Legilimens, I think -"</p>
<p>"I requested that Miss Granger be examined by the court
Legilimens," said Dumbledore. "The examination showed -"</p>
<p>"Do we trust him?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Her," said Dumbledore. "Sophie McJorgenson, whom I remember as
an honest student of Ravenclaw, and she is bound by the Unbreakable
Vow to tell the truth of what she sees -"</p>
<p>"Could someone else be Polyjuiced as her?" Harry Potter
interrupted again. "What did you <i>observe,</i> Headmaster?"</p>
<p>Albus said heavily, "A person who looked like Madam McJorgenson
told us that a single Legilimens had lightly touched Miss Granger's
mind some months ago. That is from January, Harry, when I
communicated with Miss Granger about the matter of a certain
Dementor. That was expected; but what I did not expect was the rest
of what Sophie found." The old wizard turned to gaze into the Floo
fire, letting the orange flames reflect on his face. "As you say,
Harry, a False Memory Charm is one possibility; they are, when cast
perfectly, indistinguishable from true memory -"</p>
<p>"That doesn't surprise me," Harry interrupted. "Studies show
that human memories are more or less rewritten every time we
remember them -"</p>
<p>"Harry," Minerva said softly, and the boy's mouth clamped
shut.</p>
<p>The old wizard continued. "- but a False Memory Charm of such
quality requires as much time to create as a true memory. Creating
a detailed memory of ten minutes would be ten minutes' work. And
according to the court Legilimens," Albus's face now seemed more
tired and lined than before, "Miss Granger has been obsessing over
Mr. Malfoy since the day that Severus... yelled at her. She has
been thinking of how Mr. Malfoy might be in league with Professor
Snape, how he might be planning to harm her and harm Harry -
imagining it for hours every day - it would be impossible to create
false memories for so much time."</p>
<p>"The appearance of insanity..." Severus murmured softly, as
though he were speaking to himself. "<i>Could</i> it be natural?
No, it is too disastrous to be pure accident; too convenient for
<i>someone,</i> I have no doubt. A Muggle drug, perhaps? But that
would not be enough - Miss Granger's madness would have to be
<i>guided</i> -"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Harry said suddenly. "I get it now. The <i>first</i> False
Memory Charm was cast on Hermione after Professor Snape yelled at
her, and showed, say, Draco and Professor Snape plotting to kill
her. Then last night that False Memory was <i>removed</i> by
Obliviation, leaving behind the memories of her obsessing about
Draco for no apparent reason, at the same time she and Draco were
given false memories of the duel."</p>
<p>Minerva blinked in startlement. It would have been a thousand
years before she thought of that possibility.</p>
<p>The Potions Master was frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. "The
<i>reaction</i> to a False Memory Charm is hard to predict in
advance, Mr. Potter, without Legilimency. The subjects do not
always act as expected, when they first remember the false
memories. It would have been a risky ploy. But I suppose that is
one way Professor Quirrell could have done it."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Quirrell?</i>" said Harry. "What motive does
<i>he</i> have to -"</p>
<p>The Potions Master said dryly, "The Defense Professor is always
a suspect, Mr. Potter. You will notice a trend, given time."</p>
<p>Albus raised up a hand, a silencing gesture, and their heads all
turned to look at him. "But in this case there is another suspect,"
Albus said quietly. "Voldemort."</p>
<p>That deadliest of unspeakable words seemed to echo around the
room, canceling all the heat from the orange flames of the
fireplace.</p>
<p>"I do not know," the old wizard said slowly, "I know all too
little, of the methods of Voldemort's immortality. He searched out
those books before I did, I think. All I could find were ancient
tales, scattered across too many volumes for him to remove. But to
find truth among many stories is also a wizard's mastery, and this
I have endeavored to do. There is a human sacrifice, a murder, of
that I am certain; committed in coldest blood, the victim dying in
horror. And old, old tales of wizards possessed, doing mad deeds,
claiming the names of Dark Lords thought defeated; and there is
usually a device, of that Dark Lord, which they wield..." Albus
looked at Harry, the ancient eyes searching the younger. "I think,
Harry - though you will call it only inference - that the act of
murder splits the soul. That by ritual of blackest horror, the torn
fragment of soul is chained to this world. To a material thing of
this world. Which must be, or which then becomes, a device of
power."</p>
<p><i>Horcrux.</i> The terrible name echoed in Minerva's mind,
though it seemed that - for what reason she did not know - Albus
would not speak that word in front of Harry.</p>
<p>"And therefore," the old wizard finished quietly, "the remainder
of the soul is bound to its chained part, lingering here when its
body is destroyed. A sad and painful existence, I think it would
be; less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost..." The old
wizard's eyes were locked on Harry, who gazed back with his eyes
narrowed. "It would take time for that mutilated soul to regain a
mockery of life. That is why we have had our ten-year reprieve, I
believe; why Voldemort did not return at once. But in time... that
revenant would become capable of rising again." The old wizard
spoke with grim precision. "It is clear, from the stories, that the
Dark Lords who return by possessing another's form, wield lesser
magics than they once knew. I do not think Voldemort would be
satisfied with that. He would take some other avenue to life. But
Voldemort was more Slytherin than Salazar, grasping at every
opportunity. He would <i>use</i> his pitiful state, <i>use</i> his
power of possession, if he had reason. If he could benefit by
another's... inexplicable fury." Albus's voice had fallen to almost
a whisper. "That is what I suspect happened to Miss Granger."</p>
<p>Minerva's throat was very dry. "He's <i>here,</i>" she gasped.
"<i>Here,</i> in <i>Hogwarts</i> -"</p>
<p>Then she stopped, because the <i>reason</i> Voldemort had come
to Hogwarts -</p>
<p>The old wizard glanced at her only briefly, and said, still in
that whisper, "I am sorry, Minerva, you were right."</p>
<p>Harry's voice was edged. "Right about what?"</p>
<p>"Voldemort's strongest avenue to life," Dumbledore said heavily.
"The most desirable road for him, by which he would rise greater
and more terrible than ever before. It is guarded here, within this
castle -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said politely. "Are you stupid?"</p>
<p>"Harry," she said, but there was no force in her voice.</p>
<p>"I mean, maybe you haven't noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore,
but this castle is full of <i>CHILDREN -</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>I had no choice!</i>" bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes
were blazing now, beneath the half-moon spectacles. "I do not
<i>own</i> it, that thing which Voldemort desires. It belongs to
another, and is held here by <i>his</i> consent! I <i>asked</i> if
it could be kept in the Department of Mysteries. But <i>he</i>
would not permit that - he said it must be within the wards of
Hogwarts, in the place of the Founders' protection -" Dumbledore
passed his hand across his forehead. "No," the old wizard said in a
quieter voice. "I cannot pass this blame to him. He is right. There
is too much power in that thing, too much that men desire. I agreed
that the trap should be laid behind the wards of Hogwarts, in the
place of my own power." The old wizard bowed his head. "I knew
Voldemort would worm his way here somehow, and planned to trap him.
I did not think - I did not dream - that he would tarry in an enemy
fortress one minute longer than he must."</p>
<p>"But," said Severus in some puzzlement, "what would the Dark
Lord possibly gain by killing Lucius's only heir?"</p>
<p>"Point of order," Harry Potter said, a hard edge in his voice.
"The motives of whoever's behind this are not the primary issue.
Our top priority at this point is that an innocent Hogwarts student
is in <i>trouble!</i>"</p>
<p>The green eyes locked with the blue, as Albus Dumbledore gazed
back at the Boy-Who-Lived -</p>
<p>"Quite right, Mr. Potter," Minerva said, she hadn't even thought
about it, the words just seemed to pop out of her lips. "Albus, who
is watching over Miss Granger now?"</p>
<p>"Professor Flitwick has gone to her," the Headmaster said.</p>
<p>"She needs a <i>lawyer,</i>" Harry said. "Anyone who just blurts
out 'I did it' to the police -"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Minerva said, her tone taking on some of
Professor McGonagall's sternness without thinking, "I doubt an
attorney will be any use to Miss Granger at this point, Mr. Potter.
She is to face the judgment of the Wizengamot, and they would be
exceedingly unlikely to free her on a technicality."</p>
<p>Harry was looking at her with an utterly incredulous expression,
as though suggesting that Hermione Granger didn't need an attorney
was akin to suggesting that she be set on fire.</p>
<p>"She is correct, Mr. Potter," Severus said quietly. "Few court
processes in this country involve solicitors."</p>
<p>Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed his eyes, briefly. "Fine.
How do we get Hermione off the hook, exactly? I suppose it's too
much to hope that with all the lawyers gone, the judges understand
the concept of 'common sense' and 'prior probability' well enough
to realize that twelve-year-old girls basically never commit
cold-blooded murders?"</p>
<p>"It is the Wizengamot that she faces," said Severus. "The oldest
Noble Houses, and certain other wizards of influence." Severus's
face twisted in something approaching his customary sarcasm. "As
for them showing common sense - you might as well expect them to
make you a bacon sandwich, Potter."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, his mouth set. "Exactly what sort of penalty is
Hermione facing? Snapped wand and expulsion -"</p>
<p>"No," Severus said. "Nothing that light. Are you willfully
misunderstanding, Potter? She is facing the <i>Wizengamot</i>.
There is no set penalty. There is only the vote."</p>
<p>Harry Potter murmured, "<i>The rule of law, in complex times,
has proved itself deficient; we much prefer the rule of men, it's
vastly more efficient...</i> There's no constraining legal rules at
all, then?"</p>
<p>Light glinted off the old wizard's half-moon glasses; he spoke
carefully, and not without anger. "Legally, Harry, we are dealing
with a blood debt from Hermione Granger to the House of Malfoy. The
Lord of Malfoy proposes a repayment of that debt, and then the
Wizengamot votes on his proposal. That is all."</p>
<p>"But..." Harry said slowly. "Lucius was Sorted into Slytherin,
he's <i>got</i> to realize that Hermione was just a pawn. Not the
one he should actually be angry at. Right?"</p>
<p>"No, Harry Potter," Albus Dumbledore said heavily. "That is how
you <i>wish</i> Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy himself...
will not share your desire that he think that way."</p>
<p>Harry gazed at the Headmaster, his eyes growing colder, at the
same time that Minerva herself had to clamp down harder on her own
emotions, stop her pacing and try to breathe. She'd been trying not
to think about it, trying to turn her thoughts away from it, but
she knew. She'd known since the instant she'd heard. She could see
it in Albus's eyes -</p>
<p>"Is she facing capital punishment?" Harry said quietly, and
chills went all the way down Minerva's spine at the undertones of
that voice.</p>
<p>"No!" Albus said. "No, not the Kiss, not Azkaban, not for a
first-year in Hogwarts. Our country is not so lost, not yet."</p>
<p>"But Lucius Malfoy," Severus said tonelessly, "certainly will
not be satisfied with only snapping her wand."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said commandingly. "As I see it, we've got
two essential lines of attack. Line one, find the real culprit.
Line two, other leverage over Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved
Draco's life, does that create a blood debt from House Malfoy to
him that he could redeem to cancel Hermione's?"</p>
<p>Minerva blinked in startlement again.</p>
<p>"No," Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook his head. "It was a
clever thought - but no, Harry, I'm afraid not. There is an
exception when the Wizengamot suspects that the circumstances of a
life-debt may have been created deliberately. And the Defense
Professor is hardly above suspicion. Thus Lucius would argue."</p>
<p>Harry nodded once, face set. "Headmaster, I know I said I
wouldn't - but under the circumstances - that time Draco cast that
torture hex on me, is that debt enough -"</p>
<p>"No," the old wizard said (even as she blurted "<i>What?</i>"
and Severus lifted an eyebrow). "It would not have been enough, and
now it is no debt at all. You are an Occlumens and cannot testify
under Veritaserum. Draco Malfoy could be Obliviated of his own
memory before he could testify -" Albus hesitated. "Harry...
whatever you have done with Draco, you must assume that Lucius
Malfoy will soon know of it."</p>
<p>Harry's head sank into his hands. "He'll give Draco
Veritaserum."</p>
<p>"Yes," Albus said quietly.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived didn't say anything, as he sat with his head
in his hands.</p>
<p>The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. "Draco really
<i>was</i> trying to help Miss Granger," Severus said. "You -
Potter, you <i>actually -</i>"</p>
<p>"Turned him?" Harry said from between his hands. "I was about
three-quarters done. Taught him the Patronus Charm and everything.
I don't know what will happen now, though."</p>
<p>"Voldemort has struck a grave blow against us, this day," Albus
said. The sound of old wizard's voice was like the look of the boy
with his head in his hands. "He has taken two of our pieces, with
one... No. I should have seen it earlier. He has taken two of
<i>Harry's</i> pieces with one move. Voldemort has begun his game
again, not against myself, but against <i>Harry</i>. Voldemort
knows the prophecy, he knows who his last foe shall be. He is not
waiting to face Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy at Harry's side
when they are grown. He is striking at them <i>now</i>."</p>
<p>"Maybe it's You-Know-Who and maybe it isn't," Harry said, his
voice sounding a little unsteady. "Let's not narrow down the
hypothesis space prematurely." Harry took a breath and lowered his
hands. "The other thing we can try is to nail the real culprit
before the trial - or at least find solid evidence that
<i>someone</i> else did it."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Minerva, "Professor Quirrell told the Aurors
that he knew of someone with a motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Do
<i>you</i> know who he was talking about?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, after a hesitation. "But I think I shall
conduct that part of my investigation with the Defense Professor -
just as I would not have Professor Quirrell in the room while we
were discussing how to investigate <i>him.</i>"</p>
<p>"He suspects me?" Severus said, then gave a short laugh. "Why,
of course he does."</p>
<p>"My own plan," said Harry, "is to go look at the trophy room
where the supposed duel took place and see if I can discover
anything anomalous. If you can tell the investigating Aurors to let
me through -"</p>
<p>"What investigating Aurors?" Severus said tonelessly.</p>
<p>Harry Potter took a deep breath, slowly let it out, and then
spoke again. "In mystery books it usually takes longer than one day
to solve a crime, but twenty-four hours is - no, <i>thirty</i>
hours is eighteen hundred minutes. And I can think of at least one
other important place to look for clues - though it'll have to be
someone who can get into the Ravenclaw girls' dorm. Back when
Hermione was fighting bullies, she was finding notes under her
pillow each morning, telling her where to go -"</p>
<p>"<i>Albus...</i>" ground out Minerva.</p>
<p>"I did not send them," said the old wizard. His white eyebrows
had lifted in surprise. "I knew nothing of this. You think she was
being played, Harry?"</p>
<p>"It's a possibility," Harry said. "More so, because there's a
part of this puzzle that you don't know about yet." Harry's voice
lowered, grew more intense. "Headmaster, you already know that I
got my father's invisibility cloak from someone who left a note
under my pillow, saying it was an early Christmas present. I think
we have to assume that's the same person who left notes for
Hermione -"</p>
<p>"Harry," the old wizard said, and hesitated momentarily.
"Returning your father's cloak to you, does not seem to me like the
act of a villain -"</p>
<p>"<i>Listen</i>," Harry Potter said urgently. "The part you
<i>don't</i> know is that after Bellatrix Black escaped from
Azkaban, I found another note under my pillow, signed 'Santa
Claus', saying that they'd heard you were shutting me up inside
Hogwarts, and that they were giving me an escape route to the Salem
Witches' Institute in America. That note came with a deck of cards,
in which the King of Hearts was supposedly a portkey -"</p>
<p>"<i>Mr. Potter!</i>" cried Professor McGonagall, she hadn't
even thought before she spoke. "That could well be a <i>kidnapping
attempt!</i> You should have told - "</p>
<p>"<i>Yes</i>, Professor, I did the sensible thing," the boy said
levelly. "As <i>adapted to the circumstances</i>, I did the
sensible thing. I told Professor Quirrell. And according to
Professor Quirrell, that portkey goes to somewhere in London - it's
definitely not strong enough to be an international portkey. Now
it's <i>possible</i> that the person who sent the note is honest,
and that the point in London is just a way station." The boy
reached into his robes and took out a deck of cards, along with a
folded paper note. "I will trust you <i>not</i> to go in guns
blazing - I mean wands blazing - just in case the sender is an ally
of mine, if not yours. But if this is a trap, I say we spring it
<i>now</i>. And whoever it is, take them <i>alive</i> so we can
exhibit them before the Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize that
part."</p>
<p>Severus rose from his chair, his eyes now intent, and moved
toward Harry. "I'll need a hair of yours for Polyjuice, Mr. Potter
-"</p>
<p>"Let us not be hasty!" said Albus. "We have not yet examined the
notes sent to Miss Granger; there may be no resemblance after all.
Severus, would you enter her dorm room and see if you can find
those?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's eyebrows had raised, even as he stood to offer
the Potions Master better access to his mess of hair. "You think
two <i>different</i> people are running around Hogwarts leaving
notes beneath pillows?"</p>
<p>Severus gave a brief sardonic laugh, as his hand moved forward
and plucked a hair, which soon was being carefully wrapped in silk.
"Quite possibly. If I have learned anything in my tenure as Head of
Slytherin, I have learned what ridiculous messes arise when there
is more than one plotter and more than one plan. But Headmaster - I
think Mr. Potter is correct that I should follow this portkey and
see where it leads."</p>
<p>Albus hesitated, and then nodded reluctantly. "I will speak to
you before you go, then."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Even as Harry Potter left the room for his own investigations,
Severus spun on his heel and strode swiftly toward the jar of Floo
powder, his cloak rising behind him with his speed. "I'll get some
raw Polyjuice, add the hair, and go. Headmaster, will you stand by
to -"</p>
<p>"Albus," Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice
was, "did you leave those notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?"</p>
<p>Severus's hand halted an instant before casting Floo powder into
the fire.</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded to her, though the accompanying smile seemed a
bit hollow. "You know me far too well, my dear."</p>
<p>"And I suppose the portkey goes to a friendly home where Mr.
Potter would be kept safe and sound until you arrived to pick him
up and return him to Hogwarts?" Her voice tight - it was sensible,
she could not deny it was sensible, but somehow it seemed a little
cruel.</p>
<p>"It would depend on the circumstances," the old wizard said
quietly. "If Harry had gone so far - I might have let him make good
his escape, for a time. Better to know where he was going, and
ensure it was somewhere safe, with friends -"</p>
<p>"And to think," said Professor McGonagall, "that I had thought
to reprimand Mr. Potter for not telling us about this important
matter! Upbraid him for not having the sense to trust us!" Her
voice had risen in volume. "I shall skip that lecture, I
suppose!"</p>
<p>Severus was gazing at the Headmaster with narrowed eyes. "And
the notes to Miss Granger -"</p>
<p>"The Defense Professor, very likely," the old wizard said.
"Still - that is only a guess."</p>
<p>"I shall go look for them," Severus said. "And then, I suppose,
start looking for You-Know-Who." A frown crossed the Potions
Master's face. "A task at which I haven't the faintest idea of
where to start. Do you know of any magics to find a soul,
Headmaster?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Divination classroom was lit by the dim red light of a
hundred small fires where burned a hundred kinds of incense, so
that if you were to ask in one word what the room looked like, the
answer would be 'smoke'. (Assuming you bothered to look at
anything, when your nose was threatening to overload and die.) If
your gaze could pierce those dank mists, you would see a tiny,
cluttered room in which forty stuffed armchairs, most of them
unused, were crammed around a small open space in the center of the
room, where a circular trapdoor waited on your escape.</p>
<p>"The grim!" Professor Trelawney said in a quavering voice, as
she peered into George Weasley's teacup. "The grim! It is a sign of
death! One whom you know, George - someone you know is to die! And
soon - yes, it shall be quite soon, I think - unless of course it
is later -"</p>
<p>It would have been a good deal scarier, thought Fred and George,
if she hadn't said the same thing to every single other student in
their Divination class. They were hardly even thinking about it at
this point; all their thoughts were on today's disaster -</p>
<p>The trapdoor in the floor flew open with a bang that caused
Professor Trelawney to shriek and spill George's tea all over his
robes, and then an instant later Dumbledore was whooshing up out of
the floor with a bird of fire upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Fred!" the old wizard said commandingly. His robes were the
black of a moonless night, his eyes hard like blue diamonds.
"George! With me, now!"</p>
<p>There was an collective gasp and by the time Fred and George
were climbing down the ladder after the Headmaster, the entire
class was already speculating what role they'd played in the
attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>The trapdoor had hardly slammed shut above them before all
nearby sounds muted and the old wizard spun on them and held out a
hand and commanded, "Give me the map!"</p>
<p>"M-map?" said Fred or George in total shock. They'd never even
suspected that Dumbledore suspected. "Why, w-we don't know what
you're -"</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger is in trouble," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"The Map is in our dorm," George or Fred said immediately. "Just
give us a few minutes to get it and we'll -"</p>
<p>The wizard's arms swept them up as if they were hugging-pillows,
there was a piercing cry and a flash of fire and then the three of
them were in the third-year Gryffindor's boys' dorm.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Fred and George were handing over the Map
to the Headmaster, wincing only slightly at the sacrilege of giving
their precious piece of the Hogwarts security system to the person
who actually owned it, and the old wizard was frowning at the
apparent blankness.</p>
<p>"You've got to say," they explained, "<i>I solemnly swear that I
am up to no good -</i>"</p>
<p>"I decline to lie," said the old wizard. He held the Map high
and bellowed, "Hear me, Hogwarts! <i>Deligitor prodi!</i>" An
instant later the Headmaster was wearing the Sorting Hat, which
looked <i>scarily right</i> upon his head, as though Dumbledore had
always been waiting for a patchwork pointed hat to complete his
existence.</p>
<p>(Fred and George immediately memorized this phrase, just in case
it would work for somebody besides the Headmaster, and began trying
to think of pranks that would involve the Sorting Hat.)</p>
<p>The old wizard wasted not a moment before sweeping the Sorting
Hat off his head and turning it upside-down - it was hard to tell
with the Hat upside-down, but it looked a bit cross at the
treatment - and then plunged in his hand and drew out a crystal
rod. With this instrument he began tracing rune-like patterns on
the Map, muttering strange incantations that sounded not quite like
Latin and echoed in their ears in an unusually creepy fashion. In
the midst of tracing one rune he looked up at both of them, fixing
them with a sharp glare. "I will return this to you later, sons of
Weasley. Go back to class."</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster," they said, and hesitated. "Ah - about
Hermione Granger, is she really going to be bound to serve Draco
Malfoy forever as his -"</p>
<p>"<i>Go,</i>" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>They went.</p>
<p>When he was alone in the room, the old wizard looked down at the
map, which had now written upon itself a fine line drawing of the
Gryffindor dorms in which they stood, the small handwritten
<i>Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore</i> the only name left therein.</p>
<p>The old wizard smoothed the map, bent over it, and whispered,
"Find Tom Riddle."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The interrogation room at the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement was usually lit by a small orange light, so that the
Auror interrogating you would be leaning toward your uncomfortable
metal chair with most of their face in shadow, preventing you from
reading their expression, even as they read yours.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Quirrell had entered the room, the small orange
light had dimmed and begun flickering like a candle about to be
blown out by the wind. The room was now lit by a sourceless
ice-colored glow which illuminated all of Mr. Quirrell's pale skin
like alabaster, except, somehow, his eyes, which stayed in
darkness.</p>
<p>The Auror on duty outside had surreptitiously tried to dispel
this effect four times without the slightest success, despite the
fact that Mr. Quirrell had politely surrendered his wand upon being
detained for interrogation, and had shown no sign of speaking any
incantations nor exerting any other power.</p>
<p>"Quirinus... Quirrell," drawled the man now sitting across from
where the Defense Professor had waited courteously. The
interrogator had tawny hair that swept back like a lion's mane,
with yellowish eyes set into the sternly lined face of a man late
in his tenth decade. The man was, at this moment, leafing through a
large folder of parchments that he had taken from a black and very
solid-looking briefcase after he had limped into the room and sat
down, seeming not to look at the face of the man he was
interrogating. He had not introduced himself.</p>
<p>After some further leafing through parchments, carried out in
silence, the Auror spoke again. "Born the 26th of September, 1955,
to Quondia Quirrell, of an acknowledged tryst with Lirinus
Lumblung..." intoned the Auror. "Sorted into Ravenclaw... O.W.L.S.
quite good... N.E.W.T.S. in Charms, Transfiguration... an
Outstanding in Muggle Studies, impressive... Ancient Runes, and ah
yes, Defense. An Outstanding in that as well. Went on to become
quite the tourist, visiting all sorts of places. Portkey visas for
Transylvania, the Forbidden Empire, the City of Endless Night... my
my, <i>Texas</i>." The man looked up from the portfolio, eyes
narrowed. "What were you doing <i>there</i>, Mr. Quirrell?"</p>
<p>"Sightseeing, mostly in the Muggle areas," the Defense Professor
said easily. "As you say, I am quite the tourist."</p>
<p>The man listened to this with a frown, then looked back down,
then up again. "I also see that you visited Fuyuki City in
1983."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor lifted an eyebrow in mild puzzlement.
"What of it?"</p>
<p>"What did you do in Fuyuki City?" The question snapped out
razor-sharp.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor frowned slightly. "Nothing of any account.
I visited some better-known sights, some less-known sights, and
aside from that, kept to myself."</p>
<p>"Really?" the Auror said softly. "I find that reply rather
interesting."</p>
<p>"How so?" said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>"Because there was no visa listed for Fuyuki City." The man
slammed the folder shut. "You're not Quirinus Quirrell. Who the
<i>hell</i> are you?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Potions Master walked quietly into the Ravenclaw girls'
dorm, the first-year dorm room, a festive place where bronze and
blue competed to be the color of stuffed animals, scarves and
dresses, small bits of inexpensive jewelry, and posters of famous
people. Hermione Granger's bed was easy to identify; it was the one
that had been attacked by a book monster.</p>
<p>Nobody else seemed to be around, at that time of day, and a
number of spells verified this.</p>
<p>The Potions Master searched under Hermione Granger's pillow, and
beneath her bed, and then began going through her trunk, sorting
through mentionable and unmentionable items without change of
expression, and finally succeeded in drawing forth a set of papers
describing places and times where bullies would be found, all of
the papers signed only with an elaborate 'S'.</p>
<p>A brief burst of fire later, the papers were gone, and the
Potions Master left to report the failure of his mission.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Defense Professor was sitting calmly with his hands still
folded in his lap. "If you consult Headmaster Dumbledore," said the
Defense Professor, "you will find that he is well aware of this
matter, and that I agreed to teach his Defense class on the
explicit condition that no inquiry be made into my -"</p>
<p>In a lightning motion, the interrogator whipped out his wand and
spat "<i>Polyfluis Reverso!</i>" at the same time that the Defense
Professor sneezed, which somehow caused the mirror-silvered ray to
disrupt in a shower of white sparks.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," the Defense Professor said politely.</p>
<p>The smile that the Auror gave had absolutely no mirth in it. "So
where's the real Quirinus Quirrell, eh? Under an Imperius in the
bottom of a trunk somewhere, while you take a hair now and then for
your illegal Polyjuice?"</p>
<p>"You are making highly questionable assumptions," the Defense
Professor said with an edged voice. "What makes you think I did not
steal his body outright using incredibly Dark magic?"</p>
<p>This was followed by a certain pause.</p>
<p>"I suggest," the Auror said, "that you take this seriously, Mr.
Whoever-You-Are."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said the Defense Professor, leaning back in his
chair, "but I see little reason to humble myself on this particular
occasion. What are you going to do, kill me?"</p>
<p>"I don't appreciate your humor," the Auror said softly.</p>
<p>"How unfortunate for you, Rufus Scrimgeour," said the Defense
Professor. "You have my deepest sympathy." He tilted his head,
seeming to study the interrogator; and even within the shadow of
the ice-light, the eyes glinted.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Padma stared down at her plate.</p>
<p>"Hermione wouldn't just <i>do</i> that!" yelled Mandy
Brocklehurst, who was practically in tears, in fact she <i>was</i>
in tears, her voice would have been loud enough to silence the
Great Hall if it hadn't been for all the other students also
screaming at each other. "I - I bet Malfoy tried to - to <i>do</i>
things to her -"</p>
<p>"Our General would <i>never</i> do that!" Kevin Entwhistle
yelled even louder than Mandy.</p>
<p>"Of course he would!" shouted Anthony Goldstein. "Malfoy's the
son of a <i>Death Eater!</i>"</p>
<p>Padma stared down at her plate.</p>
<p>Draco was the General of her army.</p>
<p>Hermione was the founder of S.P.H.E.W.</p>
<p>Draco had trusted her to be his second-in-command.</p>
<p>Hermione was her fellow Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Both of them were her friends, maybe the two best friends she
had.</p>
<p>Padma stared down at her plate. She was glad the Sorting Hat
hadn't offered her Hufflepuff. If she'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff
it would probably have been much more painful, trying to decide
where her divided loyalties lay...</p>
<p>She blinked and realized that her vision had gotten blurry
again, and raised a trembling hand to wipe once more at her
eyes.</p>
<p>Morag MacDougal snorted so loudly it was audible even amid the
pandemonium of lunch, and said in a loud voice, "I bet Granger
<i>cheated</i> in her battle yesterday, I bet that's why Malfoy
challenged her <i>-</i>"</p>
<p>"All of you <i>SHUT UP!</i>" roared Harry Potter, as he hit the
table with his fists so hard that plates rattled all the way along
it.</p>
<p>At any other time it would have gotten Professors reprimanding
him, this time it just got a few nearby students to look.</p>
<p>"I'd wanted to eat lunch," Harry Potter said, "and then get back
to investigating, so I wasn't going to talk. But you're all being
<i>silly</i>, and when the truth comes out you're going to regret
what you said about innocent people. Draco didn't do anything,
Hermione didn't do anything, they were both False-Memory-Charmed!"
Harry Potter's voice had been rising on the last words. "<i>How is
that not BLOODY OBVIOUS?</i>"</p>
<p>"You think we'll believe <i>that?</i>" Kevin Entwhistle yelled
right back at him. "That's what everyone says! 'I didn't do it, it
was all just a False Memory Charm!' You think we're
<i>stupid?</i>"</p>
<p>And Morag nodded right along with him, with a condescending
look.</p>
<p>The look that came over Harry Potter's face then made Padma
flinch.</p>
<p>"I see," Harry Potter said, it wasn't a shout so Padma had to
strain to hear it. "Professor Quirrell isn't here to explain to me
how stupid people are, but I bet this time I can get it on my own.
People do something dumb and get caught and are given Veritaserum.
Not romantic master criminals, because <i>they</i> wouldn't get
caught, <i>they</i> would have learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic,
incompetent criminals get caught, and confess under Veritaserum,
and they're desperate to stay out of Azkaban so they say they were
False-Memory-Charmed. Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian
association, links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic
criminals with unbelievable excuses. You don't have to consider the
specific details, your brain just <i>pattern-matches</i> the
hypothesis into a bucket of things you don't believe, and you're
done. Just like my father thought that magical hypotheses could
never be believed, because he'd heard so many stupid people talking
about magic. Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory
Charms is <i>low-status</i>."</p>
<p>"What are you <i>blithering</i> about?" said Morag, looking down
her nose at the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"You think we'd believe anything <i>you</i> say?" yelled a
slightly older-looking Ravenclaw witch who Padma didn't recognize.
"When <i>you</i> turned Granger Dark?"</p>
<p>"And I'm not going to complain," Harry Potter said in an eerily
calm voice, "about wizards not having any logic and believing the
craziest things. Because I said that to Professor Quirrell once,
and he just gave me this <i>look</i> and said that if I wasn't
blinded by my upbringing I could think of a hundred more ridiculous
things that lots of Muggles believe. What you're all doing is very
human and very normal and doesn't make you <i>unusually</i> bad
people, so I'm not going to complain." The Boy-Who-Lived rose up
from his bench. "I'll see you all later."</p>
<p>And Harry Potter walked away from them, walked away from all of
them.</p>
<p>"You're not thinking he's <i>right,</i> are you?" said Su Li
from beside her, in a tone which made it clear what <i>she</i>
thought.</p>
<p>"I -" said Padma. Her words seemed to be caught in her throat,
her thoughts seemed to be caught in her head. "I - I mean - I
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>If you think hard enough you can do the impossible.</p>
<p>(It had always been an article of faith with Harry. There'd been
a time when he'd acknowledged the laws of physics as ultimate
limitations, and now he suspected there were no true limits at
all.)</p>
<p>If you think <i>fast</i> enough you can sometimes do the
impossible <i>quickly</i>...</p>
<p>...sometimes.</p>
<p>Only sometimes.</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>Not <i>reliably</i>.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived stared around the trophy room, surrounded by
awards and cups and plates and shields and statues and medals kept
behind thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of crystal glass
displays. For as many centuries as Hogwarts had existed, this room
had been accumulating details. A week, a month, maybe even a year,
wouldn't have sufficed to take the 'examine' option on every item
in the room. With Professor Flitwick gone, Harry had asked
Professor Vector if there was any way to detect damage to the wards
around the crystal cases, verify the residue that a real duel
should have left behind. Harry had raced through the Hogwarts
library looking for spells to tell the difference between old
fingerprints and new fingerprints, or to detect lingering
exhalations in a room. And all those attempts at playing detective
had failed.</p>
<p>There were no clues, none that he was smart enough to find.</p>
<p>Professor Snape had said that the portkey led to an empty house
in London, with no sign of anyone or anything else.</p>
<p>Professor Snape hadn't found any notes in Hermione's dorm.</p>
<p>Headmaster Dumbledore had said that Voldemort's spirit was
probably hiding out in the Chamber of Secrets where the Hogwarts
security system couldn't find him. Harry had snuck into the
Slytherin dungeons under the Cloak of Invisibility and spent the
rest of the afternoon looking through all the obvious places, but
he hadn't found anything snaky that answered back when spoken to.
The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, it seemed, hadn't been
meant to be found in a day.</p>
<p>Harry had talked to all of Hermione's friends that would still
talk to him, and none of them had remembered Hermione saying
anything specific about why she'd believed that Draco was plotting
against her.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell hadn't come back from the Ministry as of
dinnertime. The older students seemed to think that this year's
Defense Professor would probably end up being blamed for the
incident, and fired for teaching Hogwarts students to be too
violent. They'd talked about the Defense Professor as though he
were already gone.</p>
<p>Harry had used up all six hours from his Time-Turner, and there
were still no clues, and he had to go to sleep now if he wanted to
be functional at Hermione's trial the next day.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Destroyed-A-Dementor was standing in the middle of
the Hogwarts trophy room, his wand dropped at his feet.</p>
<p>He was crying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you call your brain and it doesn't answer.</p>
<p>The trial of Hermione Granger started on schedule the next
day.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="80">Chapter 80</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt 2, The
Horns Effect</h3>
<p>The Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot is cool and dark, with
concentric half-circles of stone rising up from the lowest center,
and simple wooden benches set down upon those elevated
half-circles. There is no source of light, but the chamber is
well-lit, without any apparent cause or reason; it is simply a
brute fact that the hall is well-lit. The walls like the floor are
stone, dark stone, some elegant and mysterious conjugation of rock
most fine to gaze upon, with a smooth texture that seems to flow
and shift beneath its surface. This is the Most Ancient Hall, the
oldest place of wizardry that has lasted into the modern day; every
other place of power was destroyed in one war or another. This is
the Hall of the Wizengamot, which is most ancient because the wars
ended with the building of this place.</p>
<p>This is the Hall of the Wizengamot; there are older places, but
they are hidden. Legend holds that the walls of dark stone were
conjured, created, willed into existence by Merlin, when he
gathered the most powerful wizards left in the world and awed them
into accepting him as their chief. And when (the legend continues)
the Seers continued to foretell that not enough had yet been done
to prevent the end of the world and its magic, then (the story
goes) Merlin sacrificed his life, and his wizardry, and his time,
to lay in force the Interdict of Merlin. It was not an act without
cost, for a place like this one could not be raised again by any
power still known to wizardkind. Nor yet destroyed, for those walls
of dark stone would pass unharmed, and perhaps unwarmed, through
the heart of a nuclear explosion. It is a pity that nobody knows
how to make them anymore.</p>
<p>In the highest of the rising half-circles of the Wizengamot, on
the topmost level of dark stone, there is a podium. At that podium
stands an old man, with care-lined face and a silver beard that
stretches down below his waist; this is Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore. His right hand bears a wand of power, upon his
shoulder perches a bird of fire. His left hand holds a short rod,
thin and featureless and forged of the same dark stone as the
walls, and this is the Line of Merlin Unbroken, the device of the
Chief Warlock. Karen Dutton bequeathed the Line to Albus Dumbledore
on the last day of her life, scant hours after he returned
half-dead from his defeat of Grindelwald with a phoenix flaming
brightly at his side. She in turn received the Line from the
perfectionist Nicodemus Capernaum, each wizard passing it to their
chosen successor, back and back in unbroken chain to the day Merlin
laid down his life. That (if you were wondering) is how the country
of magical Britain managed to elect Cornelius Fudge for its
Minister, and yet end up with Albus Dumbledore for its Chief
Warlock. Not by law (for written law can be rewritten) but by most
ancient tradition, the Wizengamot does not choose who shall preside
over its follies. Since the day of Merlin's sacrifice, the most
important duty of any Chief Warlock has been to exercise the
highest caution in their choice of people who are both good and
able to discern good successors. You would expect that chain of
light to miss a step, sometime down through the centuries; that it
would go astray at least once, and then never return. But it has
not. The Line of Merlin continues, unbroken.</p>
<p>(Or so say those of Dumbledore's faction. Lord Malfoy would tell
you otherwise. And in Asia they tell other tales entirely, which
may not make Britain's version wrong.)</p>
<p>Upon the bottommost platform of the Ancient Hall there is a
high-backed chair, legged and armed and without cushions, of dark
metal rather than dark stone, which Merlin did not place there.</p>
<p>The Ministry building that grew up around this place is
wood-paneled and gold-washed, bright and fire-lit, filled with
bustling foolishness. This place is different. It is the stone
heart of magical Britain, and it is neither gold-washed nor
wood-paneled, neither fire-lit nor bright.</p>
<p>Filing solemnly into this room are witches and wizards in
plum-colored robes each embroidered with a silver W. They carry
themselves with an air of seriousness showing that they are well
aware that they are terribly, terribly important. They are meeting
in the Most Ancient Hall, after all. They are the Lords and Ladies
of the Wizengamot, and they consider themselves the greatest folk
of the world's greatest magical country. Lesser folk have fallen
before them on bended knee in supplication; they are powerful, they
are wealthy, they are noble; are they not great?</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore knows everyone in this room by name. He has
taught many of them, though too few have learned. Some are his
allies, some his opponents, the rest he courts within the careful
dance of their neutrality. All of them, to him, are people.</p>
<p>The current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, if you asked him for
his opinion of the Lords and Ladies, would say that while many of
them are ambitious, few have any ambition. He would observe that
the Wizengamot is exactly where someone like that would end up -
that it is exactly the sort of opportunity you would grasp, if you
had nothing better to do. Such folk are rarely interesting, but
they are often useful; pieces to be manipulated, points to be
scored, by the true players of the game.</p>
<p>Not among the rising half-circles, but off to one side among a
raised arc for the spectators, next to a witch in pointed hat whose
face is lined with apprehension, there sits a boy dressed in the
most formal black robes that he owns. His eyes are green ice and
abstraction, and he hardly glances at the Lords and Ladies as they
bustle in. To him they are just a collection of murmuring
plum-colored robes to decorate the wooden benches, visual
background for the scene of the Most Ancient Hall. If there is an
enemy here, or something to be manipulated, it is merely "the
Wizengamot". The wealthy elites of magical Britain have collective
force, but not individual agency; their goals are too alien and
trivial for them to have personal roles in the tale. As of now,
this present time, the boy neither likes nor dislikes the
plum-colored robes, because his brain does not assign them enough
agenthood to be the subjects of moral judgment. He is a PC, and
they are wallpaper.</p>
<p>This view is about to change.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry gazed unseeing around the hall of the Wizengamot; it
looked quite old and historic and there was no doubt that Hermione
could have lectured him about the place for hours on end. The
plum-colored robes had stopped arriving, and Harry's pocketwatch,
advancing at the rate of three minutes every half-hour, said that
the trial was almost due to start.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was sitting beside him, and her eyes never
left him for more than twenty consecutive seconds.</p>
<p>Harry had read the <i>Daily Prophet</i> that morning. The
headline had been "MAD MUGGLEBORN TRIES TO END ANCIENT LINE" and
the rest of the paper had been the same. When Harry was nine years
old the IRA had blown up a British barracks, and he'd watched on TV
as all the politicians contested to see who could be the most
loudly outraged. And the thought had occurred to Harry - even then,
before he'd known much about psychology - that it looked like
<i>everyone</i> was competing to see who could be most angry, and
<i>nobody</i> would've been allowed to suggest that anyone was
being <i>too</i> angry, even if they'd just proposed the saturation
nuclear bombing of Ireland. He'd been struck, even then, by an
essential emptiness in the indignation of politicians - though he
hadn't had the words to describe it, at that age - a sense that
they were trying to score cheap points by hitting at the same safe
target as everyone else.</p>
<p>Harry had always possessed that sense of hollowness about
political indignation, but it was strange how very much more
obvious it seemed, when you were reading a dozen articles in the
<i>Daily Prophet</i> beating on Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>The leading article, written by some name that Harry didn't
recognize, had called for the minimum age for Azkaban to be
lowered, just so that the twisted mudblood who had defaced the
honor of Scotland with her savage, unprovoked attack upon the last
heir of a Most Ancient House within the sacred refuge of Hogwarts
could be sent to the Dementors that were the only punishment
commensurate with the severity of her unspeakable crime. Only this
would be enough to discourage any other foreign, subhuman brutes
who similarly believed in their twisted insanity that they could
evade the majesty of the Wizengamot's inevitable and merciless
scourging of all that threatened the honorable nobility of etcetera
etcetera etcetera.</p>
<p>The next article had said the same thing in less eloquent
words.</p>
<p>Earlier, Albus Dumbledore had told him,</p>
<p><i>"I will not try to keep you from this trial." The old
wizard's voice quiet and unyielding. "I can well foresee how that
would go. But I would have you treat me with equal courtesy in
return. The politics of the Wizengamot are delicate, and of them
you know nothing. Dare any folly and it shall be to Hermione
Granger's cost; and you will remember that folly for the rest of
your days, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres."</i></p>
<p><i>"I understand," Harry said. "I know. Just - if you're
planning to pull a rabbit out of your hat and save the day at the
last minute when everything seems lost, please tell me now instead
of letting me sit and worry -"</i></p>
<p><i>"I would not do that to you," the old wizard said, a terrible
weariness seeming to suffuse him as he turned to go. "Still less to
Hermione. But I have no rabbits in my hat, Harry. We can only see
what Lucius Malfoy wants."</i></p>
<p>There was a small sharp rap, a single brief sound that somehow
silenced the entire room and caused Harry's head to jerk around and
upward. High above, Dumbledore had just tapped his podium with the
dark rod he held in his left hand.</p>
<p>"The ninetieth session of the two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamot
is convened at the request of Lord Lucius Malfoy," the old wizard
said tonelessly.</p>
<p>At once, far to the side of the podium but also in the highest
circle, rose a tall man with a mane of long white spilling down
from his head over the shoulders of his plum-colored robes. "I
present a witness for questioning under Veritaserum," Lucius Malfoy
said, his cool tone clear throughout the room, smoothly controlled
with only a slight undertone of righteous fury. "Let Hermione, the
first Granger, be brought forth."</p>
<p>"I ask you all to remember that she is a first-year of
Hogwarts," Dumbledore said. "I will brook no abuse of this witness
-"</p>
<p>Someone in the benches quite audibly said "Pfah!" and there was
a spread of disgusted snorts, even one or two jeers.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the plum-colored robes, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>And with the growing anger came something else, a rising sense
of disquiet, of something horribly skewed, like reality itself was
being disrupted. Harry knew that, somehow, but he couldn't figure
out what was awry, or why his mind thought it was getting
worse...</p>
<p>"<i>Order!</i>" Dumbledore bellowed. He rapped the stone rod
twice against the podium, producing two more small clicks that
overrode all noise. "I will have order here!"</p>
<p>The door through which the witness was brought forth was set
directly beneath Harry's own seat, so it wasn't until the entire
group had emerged fully into the stone hall that Harry saw -</p>
<p>- an Auror trio -</p>
<p>- Hermione's back was to Harry as she was brought out, he
couldn't see her face -</p>
<p>- followed by a shining silver sparrow and a running moonlit
squirrel -</p>
<p>- and the source of the horrible wrongness, half-hidden beneath
a tattered cloak.</p>
<p>Harry shot to his feet before he could even think, it was only
Professor McGonagall's sudden frantic grab on his wrist that
stopped his hand going for his wand; and the Transfiguration
Professor whispered desperately, "<i>Harry it's all right there's a
Patronus -</i>"</p>
<p>It took a few seconds for Harry to remember himself. For the
part of himself that understood that Hermione hadn't been directly
exposed to a Dementor, to argue his other parts into something like
sanity -</p>
<p><i>But animal Patronuses aren't perfect,</i> said another voice
inside his mind. <i>Or Dumbledore wouldn't see the form of a naked
man painful to look upon. You felt it approaching, animal Patronus
or no...</i></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry Potter sat back down again as Professor McGonagall
pulled down with her grip on his wrist.</p>
<p>But by then he'd already declared war on the country of magical
Britain, and the idea of other people calling him a Dark Lord no
longer seemed important one way or another.</p>
<p>Hermione's face became visible to him, as she sat down in the
chair. She wasn't upright and defiant like she'd been in front of
Snape, she wasn't crying like she'd been when the Aurors arrested
her. She just sat there with a look of vacant horror as dark metal
chains snaked out from the chair and bound her arms and legs.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't take it. Without even thinking he was trying to
flee inside himself, flee into his dark side, pull the cold rage
over himself like a shield. It took too long, he hadn't tried to go
fully into his dark side since Azkaban. And then when his blood was
something like cold, he looked up again, and saw Hermione in the
chair again, and discovered that his dark side knew nothing about
how to deal with this type of pain, it pierced through the coldness
like a knife and didn't hurt less in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Why, if it isn't Harry Potter!" came a high, light female
voice, sickly sweet and indulgent.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry turned his head away from the chair and saw a
smiling woman wearing so much makeup that her skin looked almost
pink, sitting next to a man that Harry recognized from photographs
as Minister Cornelius Fudge.</p>
<p>"Did you have something to say, Mr. Potter?" inquired the woman,
as cheerfully as if this wasn't a trial.</p>
<p>Other people were also looking at him now.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't speak, all the words in his mind would have been
stupid to speak aloud. He couldn't find anything to say that
Neville could also have said. Dumbledore had warned Harry that if
anyone <i>else</i> wanted the Boy-Who-Lived to speak, he must
<i>pretend to be his age</i> -</p>
<p>"The Headmaster said I shouldn't ought to talk," the boy said,
not quite able to keep the edge out of his voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, but you have <i>our</i> permission to talk!" the woman said
brightly. "I'm sure the Wizengamot is always happy to hear from the
Boy-Who-Lived!" Beside her, Minister Cornelius Fudge was
nodding.</p>
<p>The woman's face was puffy and overweight, visibly pale beneath
the makeup. Almost inevitably, a certain word came to mind, and
that word was <i>toad.</i> Which, said Harry's logical part,
shouldn't correlate to morality in any way. Only in Disney movies
were ugly people more likely to be evil and vice versa; and those
movies were probably scripted by writers who'd never been ugly.
He'd give her a chance, everyone in this room deserved one
chance...</p>
<p>"Because I got rid of the Dark Lord?" the boy said, and pointed
at the Dementor where it was hovering behind Hermione's chair.
"There's something in this room that's Darker."</p>
<p>The woman's face narrowed, growing a little stern. "I realize a
young boy like yourself may be scared by them, Mr. Potter, but the
Dementors are quite obedient to the Ministry of Magic. And they
would, of course, be necessary to guard -"</p>
<p>"A twelve-year-old girl?" the boy yelled. "Those are the Darkest
creatures in the whole world, I could feel it coming here even
through the Patronus - the <i>wrongness</i> coming nearer - it's
horribly evil and it - it'd eat everyone in this room, if it could!
It shouldn't be let near any child, ever! Not me, not her, not
anyone! You ought to vote to send it away!"</p>
<p>"We'll <i>certainly</i> have no such vote -" the toad-woman
snapped.</p>
<p>"That's enough, Madam Umbridge, Mr. Potter," came Dumbledore's
stern voice from high above. And then after a short pause, the old
wizard went on, "Although, of course, the boy is correct on every
count."</p>
<p>Some of the members of the Wizengamot were looking abashed at
the Boy-Who-Lived's admonition, and a few others were nodding
violently to the old wizard's words. But they were too few. Harry
could see it. They were too few.</p>
<p>The Veritaserum was brought in then, and Hermione looked for a
brief moment like she <i>was</i> about to sob, she was looking at
Harry - no, at Professor McGonagall - and Professor McGonagall was
mouthing words that Harry couldn't make out from his angle. Then
Hermione swallowed three drops of Veritaserum and her face grew
slack.</p>
<p>"Gawain Robards," said the smooth voice of Lucius Malfoy. "Your
probity is known to all of us. If you would do the honors?"</p>
<p>One of the three Aurors stepped forward.</p>
<p>After the first few questions Harry looked away and stared off
to one side with his fingers in his ears, as Hermione's brain
played back the contents of the False Memory Charm. He couldn't
handle the drug-dulled anguish in Hermione's voice as she recounted
the false memories, and his dark side couldn't handle it either,
and he'd already heard the contents summarized.</p>
<p>Harry's mind flashed back to another day of horror, and even
though Harry had been on the verge of writing off Lord Voldemort's
continued existence as the senility of an old wizard, it suddenly
seemed horribly and uniquely plausible that the entity who'd
Memory-Charmed Hermione was the very same mind that had - <i>made
use of</i> - Bellatrix Black. The two events had a certain
signature in common. To choose that this should happen, <i>plan</i>
for this to happen - it would take more than evil, it would take
<i>emptiness</i>.</p>
<p>Harry looked up for a moment, then, and saw that the
plum-colored robes were watching, just watching.</p>
<p>Some time later, after all the stars in the night sky had gone
cold and dark and the last light in the Universe had sputtered down
to embers and gone black, the questioning of Hermione ended.</p>
<p>"If it pleases my Lords," said the voice of Lord Malfoy, "I
should like to have the testimony of my son Draco, witnessed under
two drops of Veritaserum, read aloud at this time."</p>
<p><i>Until she went after me in that battle, I wasn't plotting
anything against Granger. But after that day I really was feeling
insulted, I'd helped her all those times -</i></p>
<p>The sound that came from Hermione's throat was like she'd just
been crushed under a falling stone, so huge that she couldn't cry
or breathe, just a small sad gasp.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," said one witch from what seemed to be the
Malfoy-aligned side of the room. "But Lord Malfoy, why would your
son <i>help</i> this mudblood girl?"</p>
<p>"My son," Lucius Malfoy said in a heavy voice, "seems to have
been listening to certain misguided ideas. He is young - and he has
learned, now, we have all seen as a country, what such folly brings
in repayment."</p>
<p>A few steps down along the visitor's benches, a man wearing a
newsman's cap and a badge identifying him as belonging to the
<i>Daily Prophet</i> was avidly scribbling with a long quill.</p>
<p>The few people who'd nodded along to Dumbledore earlier had
rather sick looks on their faces. One witch in plum-colored robes
quite deliberately stood up from what had seemed like Dumbledore's
side of the room, and made her way over toward the Malfoy side.</p>
<p>The Auror went on reading, his voice monotone.</p>
<p><i>I'd been so tired from casting all those locking wards, I was
weak when I cast the last one. I thought I was stronger than
Granger but I wasn't certain, so I tested it empirically by
challenging her to a duel, that's why I d-d-did it and also because
if I'd won I was planning to beat her again the next day where
everyone could see. Stupid Veritaserum. But</i> she <i>didn't know
about that when she tried to</i> kill <i>me! And I really was
insulted by what she'd done, I really had helped her before and I
hadn't been planning anything against her then, only</i> she
<i>went after</i> me <i>in front of everyone!"</i></p>
<p>When all the witness testimony was done, the deliberations of
the Wizengamot began.</p>
<p>If you could call them that.</p>
<p>It seemed that many members of the Wizengamot were of the strong
opinion that murder was bad.</p>
<p>The plum-colored robes on Dumbledore's side of the room were
silent, the supposed forces of good saving their political capital
for more winnable battles. And Harry could hear, as though
Professor Quirrell were standing next to him, a dry voice in his
mind; explaining to him that it would hardly have been to the
politicians' own advantage to speak, just then.</p>
<p>But there was one wizard in the room whose status was high
enough that he had, it seemed, transcended his caution against
losing face; one wizard alone whose status was high enough that he
could speak a word of sanity and escape unscathed. He alone spoke
to defend Hermione, the man with a phoenix flaming bright upon his
shoulder.</p>
<p>Only Albus Dumbledore spoke.</p>
<p>The Chief Warlock didn't raise the possibility that Hermione
Granger was entirely innocent. That, the Headmaster had explained
to Harry, would not be believed, would only make it worse.</p>
<p>But Albus Dumbledore said, in one gentle reminder after another,
that the perpetrator was a first-year girl in Hogwarts; that many
had done foolish things during their youth; that a first-year in
Hogwarts was simply too young to comprehend the consequences of her
acts. He himself (the Chief Warlock said quietly) had attempted
certain foolish things during his childhood, when he was well older
than she.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore said that Hermione Granger had been beloved of
all the Hogwarts faculty, and helped four Hufflepuff girls with
their Charms homework, and had scored one hundred and three points
for Ravenclaw over the course of the school year.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore said that nobody who knew Hermione Granger
would be anything but shocked by these events. That they had, all
of them, heard the horror in her voice as she recounted her
testimony. And if some unusual madness had temporarily possessed
her, then - his voice rising in stern command - she deserved
nothing from them except sympathy and a healer's attentions.</p>
<p>And at the last, Albus Dumbledore reminded the Wizengamot, over
cries of protest, that the charge was <i>attempted</i> murder and
not murder. Albus Dumbledore said, over a rising storm of
objections, that no lasting harm had come to anyone. And Albus
Dumbledore begged them not to do worse themselves than anything
that had yet been done -</p>
<p>"<i>Enough!</i>" bellowed Lucius Malfoy, and a show of hands
ended the deliberations. The white-maned man stood tall and
terrible, his silver cane held high in one hand like a gavel about
to fall. "For what this mad woman has tried to do to my son - for
the blood debt that she owes for trying to end the line of a Noble
and Most Ancient House - I say that she will -"</p>
<p>"Azkaban!" roared a man with a scarred face, seated at Lord
Malfoy's right hand. "Send the mad mudblood to Azkaban!"</p>
<p>"Azkaban!" cried another plum-colored robe, and then another,
and another -</p>
<p>A click from the rod in Dumbledore's hand silenced the room.
"You are out of order," the old wizard said sternly. "And your
proposal is barbaric, beneath the dignity of this assembly. There
are things we do not do. Lord Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy had listened to this with an impassive face.
"Well," Lord Malfoy said after a few moments. A cold gleam lit his
eyes. "I had not planned to ask it. But if that is the will of the
Wizengamot - then let her pay as any in her place would pay. Let it
be Azkaban."</p>
<p>A great cheer of rage went up -</p>
<p>"Are you all <i>lost?</i>" cried Albus Dumbledore. "She is too
young! Her mind would not withstand it! Not in three centuries has
such a thing been done in Britain!"</p>
<p>"What will the other countries think of us?" said the sharp
voice of a woman that Harry recognized as Neville's
grandmother.</p>
<p>"Will <i>you</i> guard Azkaban after she goes there, Lord
Malfoy?" said a stern old witch that Harry didn't know. "For my
Aurors may decline to guard it, I fear, if small children are kept
within."</p>
<p>"The deliberations are ended," Lucius Malfoy said coldly. "But
if you are incapable of finding Aurors who can obey the vote of the
Wizengamot, Madam Bones, you may relinquish the position; we can
easily find another to serve in your place. The will of this Hall
is clear. For the monstrosity of her crimes, the girl is to be
tried as an adult and punished accordingly; ten years in Azkaban,
the justice for attempted murder."</p>
<p>When the old wizard spoke again, his voice was lower. "Is there
no alternative to this, Lucius? We may retire to my chambers to
discuss it, if need be."</p>
<p>The tall man of the long white hair turned, then, to regard
where the old wizard stood at the podium; and the two stared at
each other for a long moment.</p>
<p>When Lucius Malfoy spoke again his voice seemed to tremble ever
so slightly, as though the stern control on it was failing. "Blood
calls for repayment, the blood of my family. Not for any price will
I sell the blood debt owed my son. You would not understand that,
who never had love or child of your own. Still, there is more than
one debt owed to House Malfoy, and I think that my son, if he stood
among us, would rather be repaid for his mother's blood than for
his own. Confess your own crime to the Wizengamot, as you confessed
it to me, and I shall -"</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it, Albus," said the stern old witch who
had spoken before.</p>
<p>The old wizard stood at the podium.</p>
<p>The old wizard stood at the podium, his face twisting,
untwisting -</p>
<p>"Stop it," said the old witch. "You know the answer you must
give, Albus. It will not change for agonizing over it."</p>
<p>The old wizard spoke.</p>
<p>"No," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"And you, Malfoy," continued the stern old witch, "I suppose all
you really wanted this whole time was to ruin -"</p>
<p>"Hardly," said Lucius Malfoy, his lips now twisting into a
bitter smile. "No, I have no purpose here but my son's vengeance. I
only wished to show the Wizengamot the truth behind this old man's
pretended heroism and his praise of that girl - that he would
hardly think of sacrificing himself to save her."</p>
<p>"Cruelty worthy of a Death Eater indeed," said Augusta
Longbottom. "Not that I'm implying anything, of course."</p>
<p>"Cruelty?" said Lucius Malfoy, the bitter smile still on his
face. "I think not. I knew what his answer would be. I have ever
warned you that he only plays his pretended part. If you believe in
his hesitation, the more fool you. Remember that his answer was the
same." The man raised his voice. "Let us vote, my friends. I think
a show of hands will suffice for it. I do not imagine there will be
many who choose to align themselves with murderers." The voice went
cold, on the last note, the promise in it very clear.</p>
<p>"Look at the girl," said Albus Dumbledore. "See her, see the
horror you are committing! She is -" The old wizard's voice broke.
"She is afraid -"</p>
<p>The Veritaserum must have been wearing off, because Hermione
Granger's face was twisting beneath the slackness, her limbs
trembling visibly beneath the chains, as though she were trying to
run, run from that chair, but was pressed down by weights larger
than the enchanted metal links that bound her. Then there was a
convulsive effort and Hermione's neck moved, her head twisted,
enough to bring her eyes into line -</p>
<p>She looked at Harry Potter and though she didn't speak, it was
absolutely clear what she was saying.</p>
<p><i>Harry</i></p>
<p><i>help me</i></p>
<p><i>please -</i></p>
<p>And in the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot an icy voice rang
out, speech the color of liquid nitrogen, pitched too high for that
it came from too young a throat, and that voice said, "<i>Lucius
Malfoy.</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In the ancient and hallowed halls of the Wizengamot, people
looked around and it took their eyes too long to find what they
sought. It might have been high in pitch, it might have been
under-loud for the words being spoken; and yet even so, you
wouldn't have expected to hear that voice from a child.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Lord Malfoy spoke in return that people even
realized where they should be looking.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," said Lucius Malfoy. He did not incline his
head.</p>
<p>Heads spun, eyes moved, and people focused on the messy-haired
young boy standing near the weeping older witch. The boy stood
merely chest-high with his shoes on, dressed in short robes of
formal black. Though unless your eyes were keen indeed, you
couldn't have seen, from all the way across the Hall, that famous
and deadly scar beneath his messy hair.</p>
<p>"This folly does not become you, Lucius," said the boy.
"Twelve-year-old girls do not go around committing murders. You are
a Slytherin and an intelligent one. You know this is a plot.
Hermione Granger was placed on this gameboard by force, by whatever
hand lies behind that plot. <i>You</i> were surely intended to act
just as you are acting now - except that Draco Malfoy was meant to
be dead, and you were meant to be beyond all reason. But he is
alive and you are sane. Why are you cooperating with your intended
role, in a plot meant to take the life of your son?"</p>
<p>A storm seemed to be raging inside Lucius, the face beneath the
flowing white hair threatening to crack open and spill something
unguessable. The Lord of Malfoy seemed to almost speak once and
then twice again, swallowing three unheard sentences before his
lips parted for true. "A plot, you say?" Lord Malfoy said at last.
His face was twitching, hardly controlled. "And whose plot would
that be, then?"</p>
<p>"If I knew," said the boy, "I would have said so a good deal
earlier. But anyone who had ever been Hermione Granger's classmate
could tell you that she is a most unlikely murderess. She does, in
fact, help Hufflepuffs with their homework. This was not a natural
event, Lord Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Plot - or no plot -" Lucius's voice was trembling. "This
mudblood filth has touched my son and for that I will end her. You
should know that full well, <i>Harry Potter</i>."</p>
<p>"It is questionable," the boy said, "to put it mildly, whether
Hermione Granger actually cast that Blood-Cooling Charm. I do not
know the exact circumstances or what spells were involved, but
simple trickery would not have sufficed to make her do it. She did
not act of her own will, and perhaps did not act at all. Your
vengeance is being misdirected, Lord Malfoy, and deliberately so.
It is not a twelve-year-old girl who deserves your ire."</p>
<p>"And what do <i>you</i> care for her fate?" Lucius Malfoy's
voice was rising. "What is <i>your</i> stake in this?"</p>
<p>"She is my friend," the boy said, "as Draco is my friend. It is
possible that this blow was aimed at me, and not at House Malfoy at
all."</p>
<p>Again the muscles jumped in Lucius's face. "And now you are
lying to me - as you lied to my son!"</p>
<p>"Believe it or not," the boy said quietly, "I never willed
anything but that Draco should know the truth -"</p>
<p>"<i>Enough!</i>" cried the Lord Malfoy. "Enough of your lies!
Enough of your <i>games!</i> You do not understand - you would
never understand - what it means that he is my son! I will not be
denied this vengeance! No more! Never again! For the blood this
girl owes House Malfoy, she shall go to Azkaban. And if I ever find
another hand at work - even if it is your own - that hand shall be
cut off as well!" Lucius Malfoy raised his deadly silver cane as
though in command, his teeth clenched and his lips drawn back in a
snarl, like a wolf facing a dragon. "And if you have nothing better
to say than that - be silent, Harry Potter!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry's blood was hammering even beneath the ice of his dark
side, the fear for Hermione, the part of him that wanted to lash
out at Lucius and destroy him where he stood for his insolence and
his <i>stupidity -</i> but Harry didn't have the <i>power,</i> he
didn't even have a single vote in the Wizengamot -</p>
<p>Draco had said that Lucius was scared of him, for some unknown
reason. And Harry could see it in the rictus that Lord Malfoy's
face had become, drawn and tight, that it was taking all his
courage for him to tell Harry to shut up.</p>
<p>So Harry said, his voice cool and deadly, hoping to hell that it
meant something, "You will earn my enmity if you do this thing,
Lucius..."</p>
<p>Someone in the lower rows of what was evidently the blood-purist
side of the Wizengamot, who was looking down at the young boy
rather than up at Lord Malfoy, laughed in outright incredulity.
Other plum-colored robes began to laugh as well.</p>
<p>Lord Malfoy gazed at him with hard dignity, as that laughter
spread. "If you want the enmity of the House of Malfoy, you shall
have it, <i>child</i>."</p>
<p>"Now really," said the woman in too much pink makeup, "I think
this has gone on quite long enough, wouldn't you say, Lord Malfoy?
The boy will miss his classes."</p>
<p>"Indeed he will," said Lucius Malfoy, and then raised his voice
again. "I call the vote! By show of hands, let the Wizengamot
acknowledge the blood debt owed to the Noble and Most Ancient House
of Malfoy, for the attempted murder of its last scion and ending of
its line, by Hermione, the first Granger!"</p>
<p>Hands shot up one after another, and the secretary who sat in
the bottom circle began to make marks on parchment to tally them,
but it was obvious which way the majority had gone.</p>
<p>And Harry screamed inside his mind, a frantic call for help to
any part of himself that would offer a way out, a strategy, an
idea. But there was nothing, there was nothing, he'd played his
last cards and lost. And then with a last convulsive desperation
Harry plunged himself into his dark side, pushed himself into his
dark side, seizing at its deadly clarity, offering his dark side
anything if it would only solve this problem for him; and at last
the lethal calm came over him, the true ice finally answering his
call. Beyond all panic and despair his mind began to search through
every fact in its possession, recall everything it knew about
Lucius Malfoy, about the Wizengamot, about the laws of magical
Britain; his eyes looked at the rows of chairs, at every person and
every thing within range of his vision, searching for any
opportunity it could grasp -</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="81">Chapter 81</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt
3</h3>
<p>In rising half-circles of dark stone, a great sea of upraised
hands.</p>
<p>The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot, in plum-colored robes
marked with a silver 'W', stared down in stern rebuke at a young
girl trembling in chains. If they had, in any particular ethical
system, damned themselves, they clearly thought quite highly of
themselves for having done so.</p>
<p>Harry's breath was trembling in his chest. His dark side had
come up with a plan - and then rotated itself back out again
because speaking too icily would not be to Hermione's advantage; a
fact which the only-half-cold Harry had somehow not realized...</p>
<p>"The vote carries, in favor," intoned the secretary, when all
the tallying was done, and the upraised hands fell back down. "The
Wizengamot recognizes the blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to
House Malfoy for the attempted murder of its scion and ending of
its line."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy was smiling in grim satisfaction. "And now," said
the white-maned wizard, "I say that her debt shall be paid -"</p>
<p>Harry clenched his fists beneath the bench and shouted, "By the
debt owed from House Malfoy to House Potter!"</p>
<p>"Silence!" snapped the woman in too much pink makeup sitting
next to Minister Fudge. "You've disrupted these proceedings quite
enough already! Aurors, escort him out!"</p>
<p>"Wait," said Augusta Longbottom from the top tier of seats.
"What debt is this?"</p>
<p>Lucius's hands whitened on his cane. "House Malfoy owes no debt
to you!"</p>
<p>It wasn't the world's most solid hope, it was based on one
newspaper article from a woman who'd been False-Memory-Charmed, but
Rita Skeeter had seemed to find it plausible, that Mr. Weasley had
allegedly owed James Potter a debt because...</p>
<p>"I'm surprised you've forgotten," Harry said evenly. "Surely it
was a cruel and painful period of your life, laboring under the
Imperius curse of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, until you were freed of
it by the efforts of House Potter. By my mother, Lily Potter, who
died for it, and by my father, James Potter, who died for it, and
by me, of course."</p>
<p>There was a brief silence within the Most Ancient Hall.</p>
<p>"Why, what an excellent point, Mr. Potter," said the old witch
who'd been identified as Madam Bones. "I, too, am quite surprised
that Lord Malfoy would forget such a significant event. It must
have been such a happy day for him."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Augusta Longbottom. "He must have been so
grateful."</p>
<p>Madam Bones nodded. "House Malfoy could not possibly deny that
debt - unless, perhaps, Lord Malfoy is to tell us that he has
misremembered something? I should take quite a professional
interest in that. We are always trying to improve our picture of
those dark days."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's hands gripped the silver snake-handle of his
cane like he was about to strike with it, unleash whatever power it
kept -</p>
<p>Then the Lord Malfoy seemed to relax, and a chill smile came
over his face. "Of course," he said easily. "I do confess I had not
understood, but the child is quite correct. But I do not quite
think the two debts cancel - House Potter was only trying to save
itself, after all -"</p>
<p>"Not so," Dumbledore said from above.</p>
<p>"- and therefore," intoned Lucius Malfoy, "I demand monetary
compensation as well, for the redemption of the blood debt owed my
son. That, too, is the law."</p>
<p>Harry felt a strange inward flinch. That had also been in the
newspaper article, Mr. Weasley had demanded an additional ten
thousand Galleons -</p>
<p>"How much?" said the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>Lucius was still wearing the cold smile. "One hundred thousand
Galleons. If you have not that much in your vault, I suppose I must
accept a promissory note for the remainder."</p>
<p>A roar of protest went up from Dumbledore's side of the room,
even some of the plum-colored robes in the middle looked
shocked.</p>
<p>"Shall we put it to vote of the Wizengamot?" said Lucius Malfoy.
"I think few of us would like to see the little murderess go free.
By a show of hands, that additional compensation of one hundred
thousand Galleons would be required to cancel the debt!"</p>
<p>The clerk began tallying, but that vote was also clear.</p>
<p>Harry stood there, breathing deeply.</p>
<p><i>You'd better not even have to think about this,</i> Harry's
inner Gryffindor said threateningly.</p>
<p><i>It's a major purchase,</i> observed Ravenclaw. <i>We ought to
spend a lot of time thinking about it.</i></p>
<p>It shouldn't have been hard. It <i>shouldn't</i> have. Two
million pounds was only money, and money was only worth what it
could buy...</p>
<p>It was strange how much psychological attachment you could have
to 'only money', or how painful it could be to imagine losing a
bank vault full of gold that you hadn't even imagined existed just
one year earlier.</p>
<p><i>Kimball Kinnison wouldn't hesitate,</i> said Gryffindor.
<i>Seriously. Like, snap decision. What sort of hero are you? I
already hate you just for having to think about it for longer than
50 milliseconds.</i></p>
<p><i>This is real life,</i> said Ravenclaw. <i>Losing all your
money is a lot more painful for real people in real life than in
heroic books.</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i> demanded Gryffindor. <i>Whose side are you
on?</i></p>
<p><i>I wasn't advocating for a particular answer,</i> said
Ravenclaw, <i>I was just saying it because it was true.</i></p>
<p><i>Could a hundred thousand Galleons be used to save more than
one life if spent some other way?</i> said Slytherin. <i>We have
research to do, battles to fight, the difference between being
40,000 Galleons rich and being 60,000 Galleons in debt is not
trivial -</i></p>
<p><i>So we'll just use one of our ways to make money fast and earn
it all back,</i> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><i>It's not certain those will work,</i> said Slytherin, <i>and
a lot of them require starting cash -</i></p>
<p><i>Personally,</i> said Gryffindor, <i>I vote that we save
Hermione and then gang up and kill our inner Slytherin.</i></p>
<p>The clerk's voice said that the tally had been recorded and the
vote had passed...</p>
<p>Harry's lips opened.</p>
<p>"I accept your offer," said Harry's lips, without any
hesitation, without any decision having been made; just as if the
internal debate had been pretense and illusion, the true controller
of the voice having been no part of it.</p>
<p>It was clear that Lucius Malfoy had not been expecting that
reply.</p>
<p>The Lord Malfoy's mask of calm shattered, his eyes widened, he
stared at Harry in sheer blank astonishment. His mouth had opened
slightly, though he wasn't speaking, and if he was making any
peculiar noises it couldn't be heard over the roar of simultaneous
gasps from the Wizengamot -</p>
<p>A tap of stone silenced the crowd.</p>
<p>"No," said the voice of Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry's head jerked around to stare at the ancient wizard.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's lined face was pale, the silver beard was visibly
trembling, he looked like he was in the final throes of a terminal
illness. "I'm - sorry, Harry - but this choice is not yours - for I
am still the guardian of your vault."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Harry, too shocked to compose his
reply.</p>
<p>"I cannot let you go into debt to Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I
cannot! You do not know - you do not realize -"</p>
<p><i>DIE.</i></p>
<p>Harry didn't even know which part of himself had spoken, it
might have been a unanimous vote, the pure rage and fury pouring
through him. For an instant he thought that the sheer force of the
anger might take magical wing and fly out to strike the Headmaster,
send him tumbling back dead from the podium -</p>
<p>But when that mental voice had spoken, the old wizard was still
standing there, gazing at Harry, long dark wand in his right hand,
short black rod in his left.</p>
<p>And Harry's eyes also went to the red-golden bird with its claws
resting on the shoulder of Dumbledore's black robes, silent when no
phoenix should have been silent. "Fawkes," Harry said, his voice
sounding strange in his own ears, "can you scream at him for
me?"</p>
<p>The fiery bird on the old wizard's shoulder didn't scream. Maybe
the Wizengamot had demanded that a spell of silence be put on the
creature, otherwise it probably would have been screaming the whole
time. But Fawkes hit his master, one golden wing buffeting the old
wizard's head.</p>
<p>"I cannot, Harry!" the old wizard said, the agony clear in his
voice. "I am doing as I must do!"</p>
<p>And Harry knew, then, as he looked at the red-golden bird, what
he had to do as well. It should have been obvious from the
beginning, that solution.</p>
<p>"Then I too will do what I must," Harry said up to Dumbledore,
as though the two of them stood alone in the room. "You do realize
that, don't you?"</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his trembling head. "You will change your
mind when you are older -"</p>
<p>"I'm not talking about that," Harry said, his voice still
strange in his own ears. "I mean that I will not allow Hermione
Granger to be eaten by Dementors under any circumstances. Period.
Regardless of what any law says, and no matter what I have to do to
stop it. Do I still need to spell it out?"</p>
<p>A strange male voice spoke from somewhere far away, "Be sure
that the girl is taken directly to Azkaban, and put under extra
guard."</p>
<p>Harry waited, staring at the old wizard, and then spoke again.
"I will go to Azkaban," Harry said to the old wizard, as though
they stood alone in the world, "before Hermione can be taken there,
and start snapping my fingers. It may cost me my life, but by the
time she gets there, there won't be an Azkaban anymore."</p>
<p>Some members of the Wizengamot gasped in surprise.</p>
<p>Then a greater number started laughing.</p>
<p>"How would you even get there, little boy?" someone said, from
among those who were laughing.</p>
<p>"I have my ways of going places," said the boy's distant voice.
Harry kept his eyes on Dumbledore, on the old wizard staring at him
in shock. Harry didn't look directly at Fawkes, didn't give his
plan away; but in his mind he prepared to summon the phoenix to
transport him, prepared to fill his mind with light and fury, to
call for the fire-bird with all his might, he might have to do it
upon the instant if Dumbledore pointed his wand -</p>
<p>"Would you truly?" the old wizard said to Harry, also as if the
two of them stood alone in the room.</p>
<p>The room went silent again as everyone stared in shock at the
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, who seemed to be taking the mad
threat completely seriously.</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes were locked only on Harry. "Would you risk
everything - everything - only for her?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said back in reply.</p>
<p><i>That's the wrong answer, you know,</i> said Slytherin.
<i>Seriously.</i></p>
<p><i>But it's the true answer.</i></p>
<p>"You will not see reason?" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"Apparently not," Harry said back.</p>
<p>The gazes stayed locked.</p>
<p>"This is terrible folly," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"I am aware of this," answered the hero. "Now get out of my
way."</p>
<p>Strange light glinted in the ancient blue eyes. "As you will,
Harry Potter, but know that this is not over."</p>
<p>The rest of the world faded back into existence.</p>
<p>"I withdraw my objection," said the old wizard, "Harry Potter
may do as he wishes," and the Wizengamot exploded in a roar of
shock, only to be silenced by a final tap of the stone rod.</p>
<p>Harry turned his head back to look at Lord Malfoy, who looked
like he'd seen a cat turn into a person and start eating other
cats. To call the look confused did not begin to describe it.</p>
<p>"You would truly..." Lucius Malfoy said slowly. "You would truly
pay a hundred thousand Galleons, to save one mudblood girl."</p>
<p>"I think there's about forty thousand in my Gringotts vault,"
Harry said. It was strange how that was <i>still</i> causing more
internal pain than the thought of taking an over-fifty-percent risk
to his life to destroy Azkaban. "As for the other sixty thousand -
what are the rules, exactly?"</p>
<p>"It comes due when you graduate Hogwarts," the old wizard said
from high above. "But Lord Malfoy has certain rights over you
before then, I fear."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy stood motionless, frowning down at Harry. "Who is
she to you, then? <i>What</i> is she to you, that you would pay so
much to keep her from harm?"</p>
<p>"My friend," the boy said quietly.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "By the report I received, you
cannot cast the Patronus Charm, and Dumbledore knows this. The
power of a single Dementor nearly killed you. You would not dare
venture near Azkaban in your own person -"</p>
<p>"That was in January," said Harry. "This is April."</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy's eyes remained cool and calculating. "You pretend
you can destroy Azkaban, and Dumbledore pretends to believe
it."</p>
<p>Harry did not reply.</p>
<p>The white-haired man turned slightly, toward the center of the
half-circle, as though to address the greater Wizengamot. "I
withdraw my offer!" shouted the Lord of Malfoy. "I will not accept
the debt to House Potter in payment, not even for a hundred
thousand Galleons! The girl's blood debt to House Malfoy
stands!"</p>
<p>Again the roar of many voices. "Dishonorable!" someone cried.
"You acknowledge the debt to House Potter, and yet you would -" and
then that voice cut off.</p>
<p>"I acknowledge the debt, but the law does not strictly oblige me
to accept it in cancellation," said Lord Malfoy with a grim smile.
"The girl is no part of House Potter; the debt I owe House Potter
is no debt to her. As for the <i>dishonor</i> -" Lucius Malfoy
paused. "As for the grave shame I feel at my ingratitude toward the
Potters, who have done so much for me -" Lucius Malfoy bowed his
head. "May my ancestors forgive me."</p>
<p>"Well, boy?" called the scarred man sitting at Lord Malfoy's
right hand. "Go and destroy Azkaban, then!"</p>
<p>"I'd like to see that," said another voice. "Will you be selling
tickets?"</p>
<p>It went without saying that Harry didn't pick this particular
moment to give up.</p>
<p><i>The girl is no part of House Potter -</i></p>
<p>He had, in fact, seen the obvious way out of the dilemma almost
instantly.</p>
<p>It might have taken him longer if he hadn't recently overheard a
number of conversations between older Ravenclaw girls, and read a
certain number of Quibbler stories.</p>
<p>He was, nonetheless, having trouble accepting it.</p>
<p><i>This is ridiculous,</i> said a part of Harry which had just
dubbed itself the Internal Consistency Checker. <i>Our actions here
are completely incoherent. First you feel less emotional reluctance
to risk your bloody LIFE and probably DIE for Hermione, than to
part with a stupid heap of gold. And now you're balking just at
getting married?</i></p>
<p><i>SYSTEM ERROR.</i></p>
<p><i>You know what?</i> said Internal Consistency Checker.
<i>You're stupid.</i></p>
<p><i>I didn't say no,</i> thought Harry. <i>I was just saying
SYSTEM ERROR.</i></p>
<p><i>I vote for destroying Azkaban,</i> said Gryffindor. <i>It
needs to be done anyway.</i></p>
<p><i>Really, really stupid,</i> said Internal Consistency Checker.
<i>Oh, screw this, I'm assuming control of our body.</i></p>
<p>The boy took a deep breath, and opened his mouth -</p>
<p>By this point Harry Potter had entirely forgotten the existence
of Professor McGonagall, who had been sitting there this whole time
undergoing a number of interesting changes of facial expression
which Harry had not been looking at because he was distracted. It
would have been overly harsh to say that Harry had forgotten her
because he did not consider her a PC. It could be more kindly said
that Professor McGonagall was not visibly a solution to any of his
current problems, and therefore she was not part of the
universe.</p>
<p>So Harry, who at this point had a fair amount of adrenaline in
his bloodstream, startled and jumped quite visibly when Professor
McGonagall, her eyes now blazing with impossible hope and the tears
on her cheek half-dried, leapt to her feet and cried, "<i>With me,
Mr. Potter!</i>" and, without waiting for a reply, tore down the
stairs that led to the bottom platform where waited a chair of dark
metal.</p>
<p>It took a moment, but Harry ran after; though it took him longer
to reach the bottom, after Professor McGonagall vaulted half the
stairs with a strange catlike motion and landed with the
astonished-looking Auror trio already pointing their wands at
her.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger!" cried Professor McGonagall. "Can you speak
yet?"</p>
<p>Much as with Professor McGonagall, there was a certain sense in
which it could be said that Harry had forgotten about the existence
of Hermione Granger, because Harry had been tilting his neck back
to look upward rather than downward, and because he hadn't
considered her a solution to any of his current problems. Though it
was hardly certain, in fact it wasn't at all probable, that Harry
remembering to look at Hermione or think about what she must be
feeling, would have helped anything in the slightest.</p>
<p>Harry reached the bottom of the stairs and saw Hermione Granger
full on -</p>
<p>Without thinking, without being able to help himself, Harry shut
his eyes, but he'd seen.</p>
<p>Her school robes around her neck, soaked all the way through
with tears.</p>
<p>The way she'd been looking away from <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>And the eye of memory and sympathy, which could not be shut,
which could not look away, knew that Hermione had recounted the
worst shame of her life in front of the nobility of magical Britain
and Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore and Harry; and then been
sentenced to Azkaban where she would be exposed to darkness and
cold and all her worst memories until she went mad and died; and
then she'd heard that Harry was going to give away all his money
and go into debt to save her, and maybe even sacrifice his life</p>
<p>and with the Dementor standing only a few paces behind her</p>
<p>she hadn't said anything...</p>
<p>"Y-yes," whispered the voice of Hermione Granger. "I c-can
talk."</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes again and saw her face, now looking at
him. It didn't say anything like what he thought Hermione was
feeling, faces couldn't say anything that complicated, all facial
muscles could do was contort themselves into knots.</p>
<p>"H-H-Harry, I-I'm so, I'm so -"</p>
<p>"Shut up," Harry suggested.</p>
<p>"s-s-sorry -"</p>
<p>"If you'd never met me on the train you wouldn't be in any
trouble right now. So shut up," said Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"Both of you stop being silly," Professor McGonagall said in her
firm Scottish accent (it was strange how much that helped). "Mr.
Potter, hold out your wand so that Miss Granger's fingers can touch
it. Miss Granger, repeat after me. Upon my life and magic -"</p>
<p>Harry did as he was bid, thrusting his wand forward to touch
Hermione's fingers; and then Hermione's faltering voice said, "Upon
my life and magic -"</p>
<p>"I swear service to the House of Potter -" said Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>And Hermione, without waiting for any further instructions,
said, the words spilling out of her in a rush, "I swear service to
the House of Potter, to obey its Master or Mistress, and stand at
their right hand, and fight at their command, and follow where they
go, until the day I die."</p>
<p>All those words had been blurted out in a desperate gasp before
Harry could have thought or said anything, if he'd been mad enough
to interrupt.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, repeat these words," said Professor McGonagall. "I,
Harry, heir and last scion of the Potters, accept your service,
until the end of the world and its magic."</p>
<p>Harry took a breath and said, "I, Harry, heir and last scion of
the Potters, accept your service, until the end of the world and
its magic."</p>
<p>"That's it," said Professor McGonagall. "Well done."</p>
<p>Harry looked up, and saw that the entire Wizengamot, whose
existence he'd forgotten, was staring at them.</p>
<p>And then Minerva McGonagall, who <i>was</i> Head of House
Gryffindor even if she didn't always act like it, looked up high
above at where Lucius Malfoy stood; and she said to him before the
entire Wizengamot, "I regret every point I ever gave you in
Transfiguration, you vile little worm."</p>
<p>Whatever Lucius was about to say in reply was silenced by a tap
of the short rod in Dumbledore's hand. "Ahem!" said the old wizard
from his podium of dark stone. "This session has carried on quite
considerably, and if it is not dismissed soon, some of us may miss
their entire luncheon. The law of this matter is clear. You have
already voted on the terms of the bargain, and Lord Malfoy cannot
legally decline it. As we have far exceeded our allotted time, I
now, in accordance with the last decision of the survivors of the
eighty-eighth Wizengamot, adjourn this session."</p>
<p>The old wizard tapped the rod of dark stone three times.</p>
<p>"You fools!" shouted Lucius Malfoy. The white hair was shaking
as though in a wind, the face beneath was pale with fury. "Do you
think you'll get away with what you've done today? Do you think
that girl can try to murder my son and escape unscathed?"</p>
<p>The toad-like pink-makeup woman, whose name Harry could no
longer remember, was standing up from her seat. "Why, of course
not," she said with a sickening smile. "After all, the girl
<i>is</i> still a murderess, and I think the Ministry shall be
watching her affairs quite closely - it hardly seems wise that she
should be allowed to wander the streets, after all -"</p>
<p>Harry was fed up at this point.</p>
<p>Without waiting to listen, Harry turned on his heel and strode
forward in long steps toward -</p>
<p>The horror only he could truly see, the absence of color and
space, the wound in the world, above which floated a tattered
cloak; most imperfectly guarded by a running moonlit squirrel and
fluttering silver sparrow.</p>
<p>His dark side had also noticed, when it was looking through the
entire room for anything that could possibly be used as a weapon,
that the enemy had been foolish enough to bring a Dementor into
Harry's presence. That was a powerful weapon indeed, and one that
Harry might wield better than its supposed masters. There had been
a time in Azkaban when Harry had told twelve Dementors to turn and
go, and they had gone.</p>
<p><i>The Dementors are Death, and the Patronus Charm works by
thinking about happy thoughts instead of Death.</i></p>
<p>If Harry's theory was correct, that one sentence would be all it
took to pop the Aurors' Patronus Charms like a soap bubble, and
ensure that nobody within reach of his voice could cast another
one.</p>
<p><i>I am going to cancel the Patronus Charms and prevent any more
Patronuses from being cast. And then my Dementor, flying faster
than any broomstick, is going to Kiss everyone here who voted to
send a twelve-year-old girl to Azkaban.</i></p>
<p>Say that, to set up the if-then expectation, and wait for people
to understand and laugh. Then speak the fatal truth; and when the
Aurors' Patronuses winked out to prove the point, either people's
<i>anticipations</i> of the mindless void, or Harry's threat of its
destruction, would make the Dementor obey. Those who had sought to
compromise with the darkness would be consumed by it.</p>
<p>It was the other solution his dark side had devised.</p>
<p>Ignoring the gasps rising from behind him, Harry crossed the
radius of the Patronuses, strode to a single pace from Death. Its
unhindered fear burst around him like a whirlpool, like stepping
next to the sucking drain of some huge bathtub emptying out its
water; but with the false Patronuses no longer obscuring the level
on which they interacted, Harry could reach the Dementor even as it
could reach him. Harry looked straight into the pulling vacuum and
-</p>
<p><i>the Earth among the stars</i></p>
<p>all his triumph at saving Hermione</p>
<p><i>someday the reality of which you are a shadow will cease to
exist</i></p>
<p>Harry took all the silver emotion that fueled his Patronus Charm
and <i>shoved</i> it at the Dementor; and expected Death's shadow
to flee from him -</p>
<p>- and as Harry did that, he flung his hands up and shouted
"BOO!"</p>
<p>The void retreated sharply away from Harry until it came up
against the dark stone behind.</p>
<p>In the hall there was a deathly silence.</p>
<p>Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where
the toad-woman stood. She was pale beneath the pink makeup, her
mouth opening and closing like a fish.</p>
<p>"I make you this one offer," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "I never
learn that you've been interfering with me or any of mine. And you
never find out why the unkillable soul-eating monster is scared of
me. Now sit down and shut up."</p>
<p>The toad-woman fell back down to her bench without a word.</p>
<p>Harry looked further up.</p>
<p>"A riddle, Lord Malfoy!" the Boy-Who-Lived shouted across the
Most Ancient Hall. "I know you weren't in Ravenclaw, but try to
answer this one anyway! What destroys Dark Lords, frightens
Dementors, and owes you sixty thousand Galleons?"</p>
<p>For an instant Lord Malfoy stood there with eyes slightly
widened; then his face fell back into calm scorn, and his voice
spoke coolly in reply. "Are you openly threatening me, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"I'm not threatening you," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "I'm
<i>scaring</i> you. There's a difference."</p>
<p>"Enough, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "We shall be
late for afternoon Transfiguration as it is. And do come back here,
you're still terrifying that poor Dementor." She turned to the
Aurors. "Mr. Kleiner, if you would!"</p>
<p>Harry strode back to them, as the Auror addressed moved forward
and pressed a short rod of dark metal to the dark metal chair,
muttering an inaudible word of dismissal.</p>
<p>The chains slithered back as smoothly as they had come forth;
and Hermione pushed herself out of the chair as fast as she could,
and half-ran and half-staggered forward a few steps.</p>
<p>Harry held out his arms -</p>
<p>- and Hermione half-jumped half-fell into Professor McGonagall's
arms, beginning to sob hysterically.</p>
<p><i>Hmpfh,</i> said a voice inside Harry. <i>I kind of thought
we'd earned that one ourselves.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, shut up.</i></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was holding Hermione so firmly that you
might have thought it was a mother holding her daughter, or maybe
granddaughter. After a few moments Hermione's sobs slowed, and then
stopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted her stance and
grabbed onto her more tightly; the girl's hands were dangling
limply, now, and her eyes were closed -</p>
<p>"She'll be fine, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said softly
in Harry's direction, without looking at him. "She just needs a few
hours in one of Madam Pomfrey's beds."</p>
<p>"All right, then," Harry said. "Let's get her to Madam
Pomfrey's."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore, as he descended to the bottom of the
dark stone stairs. "Let us all go home, indeed." His blue eyes were
locked on Harry, as hard as sapphires.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot are departing their
wooden benches, leaving as they came, looking rather nervous.</p>
<p>The vast majority are thinking 'The Dementor was frightened of
the Boy-Who-Lived!'</p>
<p>Some of the shrewder ones are already wondering how this will
affect the delicate power balance of the Wizengamot - if a new
piece has appeared upon the gameboard.</p>
<p>Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of 'I wonder
how he did that.'</p>
<p>This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many are
wealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other
ways. Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of
business and politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed.
Almost none have walked the path of a powerful wizard. They have
not read through ancient books, scrutinized old scrolls, searching
for truths too powerful to walk openly and disguised in conundrums,
hunting for true magic among a hundred fantastic fairy tales. When
they are not looking at a contract of debt, they abandon what
shrewdness they possess and relax with some comfortable nonsense.
They believe in the Deathly Hallows, but they also believe that
Merlin fought the dread Totoro and imprisoned the Ree. They know
(because that too is part of the standard legend) that a powerful
wizard must learn to distinguish the truth among a hundred
plausible lies. But it has not occurred to them that they might do
the same.</p>
<p>(Why not? Why, indeed, would wizards with enough status and
wealth to turn their hands to almost any endeavor, choose to spend
their lives fighting over lucrative monopolies on ink importation?
The Headmaster of Hogwarts would hardly see the question; of course
most people should not be powerful wizards, just as most people
should not be heroes. The Defense Professor could explain at great
and cynical length why their ambitions are so trivial; to him, too,
there is no puzzle. Only Harry Potter, for all the books he has
read, is unable to understand; to the Boy-Who-Lived the life
choices of the Lords and Ladies seem incomprehensible - not what a
good person would do, nor yet an evil person either. Now which of
the three is most wise?)</p>
<p>For whatever reason, then, most of the Wizengamot has never
walked the path that leads to powerful wizardry; they do not seek
out what is hidden. For them, there is no <i>why.</i> There is no
explanation. There is no causality. The Boy-Who-Lived, who was
already halfway into the magisterium of legend, has now been
promoted all the way there; and it is a brute fact, simple and
unexplained, that the Boy-Who-Lived frightens Dementors. Ten years
earlier they were told that a one-year-old boy defeated the most
terrible Dark Lord of their generation, perhaps the most evil Dark
Lord ever to live; and they just accepted that too.</p>
<p>You are not meant to question that sort of thing (they know in
some unspoken way). If the most terrible Dark Lord in history,
confronts an innocent baby - why, how could he <i>not</i> be
vanquished? The rhythm of the play demands it. You are supposed to
applaud, not stand up from your seat in the audience and say 'Why?'
It is just the story's conceit, that in the end the Dark Lord is
brought down by a little child; and if you are going to question
that, you might as well not attend the play in the first place.</p>
<p>It does not occur to them to second-guess the application of
such reasoning to the events they have seen with their own eyes in
the Most Ancient Hall. Indeed, they are not consciously aware that
they are using story-reasoning on real life. As for scrutinizing
the Boy-Who-Lived with the same careful logic they would use on an
political alliance or a business arrangement - what brain would
associate to <i>that,</i> when a part of the legendary magisterium
is at hand?</p>
<p>But there are a very few, seated on those wooden benches, who do
<i>not</i> think like this.</p>
<p>There are a certain few of the Wizengamot who have read through
half-disintegrated scrolls and listened to tales of things that
happened to someone's brother's cousin, not for entertainment, but
as part of a quest for power and truth. They have already marked
the Night of Godric's Hollow, as reported by Albus Dumbledore, as
an anomalous and potentially important event. They have wondered
why it happened, if it did happen; or if not, why Dumbledore is
lying.</p>
<p>And when an eleven-year-old boy rises up and says "Lucius
Malfoy" in that cold adult voice, and goes on to speak words one
simply would not expect to hear from a first-year in Hogwarts, they
do not allow the fact to slip into the lawless blurs of legends and
the premises of plays.</p>
<p>They mark it as a clue.</p>
<p>They add it to the list.</p>
<p>This list is beginning to look somewhat alarming.</p>
<p>It doesn't particularly help when the boy yells "BOO!" at a
Dementor and the decaying corpse presses itself flat against the
opposite wall and its horrible ear-hurting voice rasps, "<i>Make
him go away.</i>"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="82">Chapter 82</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs,
Final</h3>
<p>Phoenix travel was a sensation entirely unlike Apparition or
portkeys. You caught on fire - you definitely felt yourself
catching on fire, even though there was no pain - and instead of
burning to ashes, the fire burned all the way through you and you
<i>became</i> fire, and then you went out in one place and blazed
up in another. It didn't sicken the stomach like portkeys or
Apparition, but it was a rather unnerving experience nonetheless.
If the underlying truth of phoenix travel really was becoming a
specific instantiation of a more general Fire, then that seemed to
hint you could potentially burn <i>anywhere -</i> even in the
distant past, or in another universe, or in two places at once. You
might go out in one place and blaze up in a hundred others, and the
you who arrived at Hogwarts would never know the difference. Though
Harry had read what he could about phoenixes, trying to figure out
how to get one of his own, and there'd been no hint of anything
remotely like <i>that</i> capability.</p>
<p>Harry caught fire and went out and blazed up somewhere else; and
just like that he, and the Headmaster, and the unconscious form of
Hermione Granger held in the Headmaster's arms, were occupying
another place; with Fawkes above them all. A calm, warm room of
bright stone columns, skylit on all four sides, populated by white
beds in long rows, four of which had silencing veils drawn around
them, and the rest empty.</p>
<p>In one corner of Harry's vision, a surprised-looking Madam
Pomfrey was turning toward them. Dumbledore seemed to pay the
senior healer no heed, as he carefully laid down Hermione on an
unoccupied white bed.</p>
<p>From a distant corner there was a flash of green, and from out
of a fireplace strode Professor McGonagall, brushing herself off
slightly from the Floo ashes.</p>
<p>The old wizard turned from the bed and reached one of his arms
around Harry again; and then the Boy-Who-Lived and his wizard
vanished in another burst of fire.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Harry had fully lit up again he was standing in the
Headmaster's office, amid the noises of a dozen dozen inexplicable
gidgets.</p>
<p>The young boy took a step away from the old wizard and then
turned on him, emerald and sapphire eyes meeting.</p>
<p>The two of them did not speak for a time, looking at each other;
as though all they had to speak could be said only by stares, and
not said in any other way.</p>
<p>In time the boy enunciated words slowly and precisely.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe that a phoenix is still upon your
shoulder."</p>
<p>"The phoenix chooses but once," said the old wizard. "They might
perhaps leave a master who chooses evil over good; they will not
leave a master forced to choose between one good and another.
Phoenixes are not arrogant. They know the limits of their own
wisdom." Stern indeed, that ancient gaze. "Unlike you, Harry."</p>
<p>"Choose between one good and another," Harry echoed flatly.
"Like Hermione Granger's life, versus a hundred thousand Galleons."
The rage and indignation Harry wanted to put into his voice wasn't
quite there, for some reason, maybe because -</p>
<p>"You are hardly in a position to speak to me of that, Harry
Potter." The Headmaster's voice was deceptively soft. "Or what was
that look of reluctance that I saw upon your face, there in the
Most Ancient Hall?"</p>
<p>The sense of inward hollowness grew worse. "I was looking for
other alternatives," Harry bit out. "Some way to save her that
<i>didn't</i> lose the money."</p>
<p><i>Wow,</i> said Ravenclaw. <i>You just told an outright lie.
Not only that, I think you actually</i> believed <i>it for the
seconds it took to say it. That's kinda scary.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Is</i> that what you were thinking, Harry?" The blue eyes
were keen, and there was a terrifying moment when Harry wondered if
the world's most powerful wizard could see right past his
Occlumency barriers.</p>
<p>"<i>Yes,</i>" Harry said, "I flinched away from the pain of
losing all the money in my vault. But I <i>did</i> it!
<i>That's</i> what counts! And <i>you</i> -" The indignation that
had faltered out of Harry's voice returned. "You <i>actually</i>
put a price on Hermione Granger's life, and you put it below a
hundred thousand Galleons!"</p>
<p>"Oh?" the old wizard said softly. "And what price do you put on
her life, then? A million Galleons?"</p>
<p>"Are you familiar with the economic concept of 'replacement
value'?" The words were spilling from Harry's lips almost faster
than he could consider them. "Hermione's replacement value is
<i>infinite!</i> There's nowhere I can go to buy another one!"</p>
<p><i>Now you're just talking mathematical nonsense,</i> said
Slytherin. <i>Ravenclaw, back me up here?</i></p>
<p>"Is Minerva's life also of infinite worth?" the old wizard said
harshly. "Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Yes and yes," Harry snapped. "That's part of Professor
McGonagall's job and she knows it."</p>
<p>"Then Minerva's value is not infinite," said the old wizard,
"for all that she is loved. There can only be one king upon a
chessboard, Harry Potter, only one piece that you will sacrifice
any other piece to save. And Hermione Granger is not that piece.
Make no mistake, Harry Potter, this day you may well have lost your
war."</p>
<p>And if the old wizard's words hadn't hit quite so hard, and
quite so close to home, Harry might not have said what he said
then.</p>
<p>"Lucius was right," Harry ground out. "You never had a wife, you
never had a daughter, you've never had anything but war -"</p>
<p>The old wizard's left hand closed hard upon Harry's wrist, bony
fingers digging into the still-developing muscle of Harry's arm,
and for a moment Harry was paralyzed with the shock of it, he had
forgotten what it meant that adults were stronger.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore did not seem to notice. He only turned,
dragging Harry with him, and moved forward in hard steps toward the
wall of the room.</p>
<p>"<i>Phoenix's price.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry was pulled up along the black stairs.</p>
<p>"<i>Phoenix's fate.</i>"</p>
<p>The room of black pedestals, silver light falling on shattered
wands.</p>
<p>"You think," yelled Harry, after his lips unlocked, "that you
can win any argument, just by standing here?"</p>
<p>The old wizard ignored him, dragging Harry across the room. His
right hand, no longer holding his wand, grabbed up a vial of silver
fluid -</p>
<p>Harry blinked in shock; the vial of silver fluid had been
standing next to a picture of <i>Dumbledore,</i> or so it had
appeared to Harry in the brief moment before he was dragged
past.</p>
<p>Past the end of all the pedestals, at the farthest part of the
room, rose a great stone basin with runes carved into it that Harry
didn't recognize. The center was a shallow depression filled with
transparent liquid, and into this the old wizard dumped the
canister of silver fluid, which at once began to spread out, to
swirl, to set the entire basin glowing eerie white.</p>
<p>The old wizard's hand let go of Harry's arm and gestured to the
glowing basin, commanding harshly, "Look!"</p>
<p>As requested, Harry stared at the glowing water.</p>
<p>"Put your head into the Pensieve, Harry Potter." The old
wizard's voice was stern.</p>
<p>Harry had heard that word before, but he couldn't remember where
. "What - does this do -"</p>
<p>"Memories," the old wizard said. "You will see my memory. My
oath that it is safe. Now look into the Pensieve, Ravenclaw, if you
still care anything at all for your precious truth!"</p>
<p>That was a request that Harry could not deny, and he stepped
forward and thrust his head into the glowing water.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Harry was sitting behind the desk in the Headmaster's office
of Hogwarts, and his wrinkled hands that clutched at his head were
spotted with age and white hairs.</i></p>
<p><i>"He is all that I have!" wept a voice, very strange was
Dumbledore's voice as Dumbledore himself remembered it, from the
inside it seemed far less stern and wise. "The last of my family!
All that I have left!"</i></p>
<p><i>No emotion had been allowed to pass through the Pensieve,
only the physical sensation of seeming to speak the words. Harry
heard the utter desolation in Dumbledore's words, the sounds that
seemed to come from Harry's own throat, but Harry did not feel it
beyond the hearing.</i></p>
<p><i>"You've got no choice," said a harsh voice.</i></p>
<p><i>The eyes moved, the field of vision jumped to a man that
Harry didn't recognize, in clothing tinged with Auror crimson but
made of solid leather with many pockets.</i></p>
<p><i>His right eye was overlarge, with an electric-blue pupil that
constantly darted and moved.</i></p>
<p><i>"You cannot ask this of me, Alastor!" Dumbledore's voice was
wild. "Not this! Anything but this!"</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm not asking," growled the man. "Voldie's the one who's
asking, and you're going to tell him no."</i></p>
<p><i>"For money, Alastor?" Dumbledore's voice was begging. "Only
for money?"</i></p>
<p><i>"You ransom Aberforth, you lose the war," the man said
sharply. "That simple. One hundred thousand Galleons is nearly all
we've got in the war-chest, and if you use it like this, it won't
be refilled. What'll you do, try to convince the Potters to empty
their vault like the Longbottoms already did? Voldie's just going
to kidnap someone else and make another demand. Alice, Minerva,
anyone you care about, they'll all be targets if you pay off the
Death Eaters. That's not the lesson you should be trying to teach
them."</i></p>
<p><i>"If I do this I will have no one. No one." Dumbledore's voice
broke, the world tilted as the outlooking head fell down into the
ancient hands, and awful sounds came from not-Harry's throat as he
began to sob like a child.</i></p>
<p><i>"Shall I tell Voldie's messenger no?" said Alastor's voice,
now strangely gentle. "You don't have to do it yourself, old
friend."</i></p>
<p><i>"No - I will say it myself - I must -"</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The memory ended with a shock and Harry ripped his head out of
the glowing water, gasping as though he'd been deprived of air.</p>
<p>The transition between scenes, between decade-old reality and
present moment, was another jolt to Harry's mind; in some fashion
his immersion in the past had unanchored him. The broken old man
sobbing in his office had been another person in another era, Harry
had understood that much; someone softer -</p>
<p>Before it had all vanished like dissipating smoke, returning the
<i>now,</i> the present day.</p>
<p>Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven
from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like
mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black
diamond.</p>
<p>"Do you also wish to see my brother as he died under the
Cruciatus?" said Albus Dumbledore. "Voldemort sent me that memory
as well!"</p>
<p>"And that - " Harry was having trouble producing a voice, for
the growing sickness in his chest. "<i>That</i> was when -" The
words seemed to burn in his throat, as the awful knowledge dawned
on him, the horrible understanding. "That was when you burned
Narcissa Malfoy alive in her own bedroom."</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore's gaze was cold as he answered. "To that
question only a fool would say yea or nay. What matters is that the
Death Eaters believe I killed her, and that belief kept safe the
families of all who served the Order of the Phoenix - until this
day. Now do you understand what you have done? What you have done
to your <i>friends,</i> Harry Potter, and to any that stand with
you?" The old wizard seemed to grow still taller and more terrible,
as his voice rose louder. "You have made them all targets, and
targets they will remain! Until you prove, the only way it can be
proven, that you are no longer willing to pay such prices!"</p>
<p>"And is it true?" Harry said. There was a buzzing sensation
filling him, his body growing more distant. "What Draco said, that
Narcissa Malfoy never got her hands dirty, that she was only
Lucius's wife? She was an enabler, I get that, but I can't back
that deserving being <i>burned alive</i>."</p>
<p>"Nothing less would have convinced them that I was done with
hesitation." The old wizard's voice brooked no question and no
refusal. "Always I was too reluctant to do as I must, always it was
others who paid the cost of my mercy. So Alastor told me from the
beginning, but I did not listen to him. You, I expect, shall prove
better at such decisions than I."</p>
<p>"I'm surprised," Harry said, amazed that his voice was almost
steady. "I would have expected the Death Eaters to go after another
Light family and start a cycle of escalating retaliation, if you
didn't get them all with your first strike."</p>
<p>"If my opponent had been Lucius, perhaps." Dumbledore's eyes
were like stones. "I am told that Voldemort laughed at the news,
and proclaimed to his Death Eaters that I had finally grown, and
was at last a worthy opponent. Perhaps he was right. After the day
I condemned my brother to his death, I began to weigh those who
followed me, balancing them one against another, asking who I would
risk, and who I would sacrifice, to what end. It was strange how
many fewer pieces I lost, once I knew what they were worth."</p>
<p>Harry's jaw seemed locked, like it took a massive effort to make
his lips move. "But then it's not like Lucius was deliberately
taking Hermione for ransom," Harry's voice said thinly. "From
Lucius's perspective, someone else broke the truce first. So with
that in mind, how many Galleons <i>was</i> Hermione worth, exactly?
Leaving aside the Danegeld thing, if it was just some ordinary
threat to her life, how much should I have paid to save her? Ten
thousand Galleons? Five thousand?"</p>
<p>The old wizard did not answer.</p>
<p>"It's a funny thing," Harry said, his voice wavering like
something seen through water. "Do you know, the day I went in front
of the Dementor, what my worst memory was? It was my parents dying.
I heard their voices and everything."</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes widened behind the half-moon glasses.</p>
<p>"And here's the thing," Harry said, "here's the thing I've been
thinking about over and over. The Dark Lord gave Lily Potter the
chance to walk away. He said that she could flee. He <i>told</i>
her that dying in front of the crib wouldn't save her baby. 'Step
aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all -'" An
awful chill came over Harry as he spoke those words from his own
lips, but he shook it off and continued. "And afterward I kept
thinking, I couldn't seem to stop myself from thinking, wasn't the
Dark Lord <i>right?</i> If only Mother had stepped away. She tried
to curse the Dark Lord but it was suicide, she had to have
<i>known</i> that it was suicide. Her choice wasn't between her
life and mine, her choice was for herself to live or for both of us
to die! If she'd only done the logical thing and walked away, I
mean, I love Mum too, but Lily Potter would be alive right now and
she would be my mother!" Tears were blurring Harry's eyes. "Only
now I understand, I know what Mother must have felt. She
<i>couldn't</i> step aside from the crib. She couldn't! Love
doesn't walk away!"</p>
<p>It was like the old wizard had been struck, struck by a chisel
that shattered him straight down the middle.</p>
<p>"What have I said?" the old wizard whispered. "What have I said
to you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know!" shouted Harry. "I wasn't listening either!"</p>
<p>"I - I'm sorry, Harry - I -" The old wizard pressed his hands to
his face, and Harry saw that Albus Dumbledore was weeping. "I
should not have said, such things to you - I should not, have
resented, your innocence -"</p>
<p>Harry stared at the wizard for another second, and then Harry
turned and marched out of the black room, down the stairs, through
the office -</p>
<p>"I really don't know why you're still on his shoulder," Harry
said to Fawkes.</p>
<p>- out the oaken door and into the endlessly turning spiral.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry had arrived in the Transfiguration classroom before anyone
else, before even Professor McGonagall. There was Charms class
earlier, for his year, but that he hadn't even bothered trying to
attend. Whether Professor McGonagall would make today's class he
didn't know. There was something ominous about all the empty desks
beside him, the absence at the board. As if he stood alone in
Hogwarts, with all his friends departed.</p>
<p>According to the class schedule, today's lesson was on sustained
Transfigurations, all the rules of which Harry had learned by heart
back when he was Transfiguring a huge rock into the small diamond
that shone on his pinky finger. It would be a theoretical subject,
rather than practical, for the rest of the class; which was a pity,
because he could have used a dose of Transfiguration's trance.</p>
<p>Harry noted distantly that his hand was trembling, to the point
where he had trouble undoing the pouch's drawstring as he drew
forth the Transfiguration textbook.</p>
<p><i>You were monstrously unfair to Dumbledore,</i> said the voice
Harry had been calling Slytherin, only now it also seemed to be the
Voice of Economic Sensibility and maybe also Conscience.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped down to his textbook, but the section was
so familiar it might as well have been a blank parchment.</p>
<p><i>Dumbledore fought a war against a Dark Lord who deliberately
set out to break him in the cruelest possible way. He had to choose
between losing his war and his brother. Albus Dumbledore knows, he
learned in the worst possible way, that there are limits to the
value of one life; and it almost broke his sanity to admit it. But
you, Harry Potter -</i> you <i>already knew better.</i></p>
<p>"Shut up," the boy whispered to the empty Transfiguration
classroom, though there was nobody there to hear it.</p>
<p><i>You'd already read about Philip Tetlock's experiments on
people asked to trade off a sacred value against a secular one,
like a hospital administrator who has to choose between spending a
million dollars on a liver to save a five-year-old, and spending
the million dollars to buy other hospital equipment or pay
physician salaries. And the subjects in the experiment became
indignant and wanted to punish the hospital administrator for even
thinking about the choice. Do you remember reading about that,
Harry Potter? Do you remember thinking how very stupid that was,
since if hospital equipment and doctor salaries didn't also save
lives, there would be no point in having hospitals or doctors?
Should the hospital administrator have paid a billion pounds for
that liver, even if it meant the hospital going bankrupt the next
day?</i></p>
<p>"Shut up!" the boy whispered.</p>
<p><i>Every time you spend money in order to save a life with some
probability, you establish a lower bound on the monetary value of a
life. Every time you refuse to spend money to save a life with some
probability, you establish an upper bound on the monetary value of
life. If your upper bounds and lower bounds are inconsistent, it
means you could move money from one place to another, and save more
lives at the same cost. So if you want to use a bounded amount of
money to save as many lives as possible, your choices must be
consistent with</i> some <i>monetary value assigned to a human
life; if not then you could reshuffle the same money and do better.
How very sad, how very hollow the indignation, of those who refuse
to say that money and life can ever be compared, when all they're
doing is forbidding the strategy that saves the most people, for
the sake of pretentious moral grandstanding...</i></p>
<p><i>You</i> knew <i>that, and you still said what you did to
Dumbledore.</i></p>
<p><i>You deliberately</i> tried <i>to hurt Dumbledore's
feelings.</i></p>
<p>He's <i>never tried to hurt</i> you, <i>Harry Potter, not
once.</i></p>
<p>Harry's head dropped into his hands.</p>
<p>Why had Harry said what he'd said, to a sad old ancient wizard
who'd fought hard and endured more than anyone should ever have to
endure? Even if the old wizard was wrong, did he deserve to be hurt
for it, after all that had happened to him? Why was there a part of
him that seemed to get angry at the old wizard beyond reason,
lashing out at him harder than Harry had ever hit anyone, without
thought of moderation once the rage had been raised, only to quiet
as soon as Harry left his presence?</p>
<p><i>Is it because you know Dumbledore won't fight back? That no
matter what you say to him, however unfair, he'll never use his own
power against you, he'll never treat you the way you treat him? Is
this the way you treat people when you know they won't hit back?
James Potter's bullying genes, manifesting at last?</i></p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Like the Sorting Hat speaking inside his head -</p>
<p><i>What is the real reason for your anger?</i></p>
<p><i>What do you fear?</i></p>
<p>A whirlwind of images seemed to flash through Harry's mind,
then, the past Dumbledore weeping into his hands; the present form
of the old wizard, standing tall and terrible; a vision of Hermione
screaming in her chains, in the metal chair, as Harry abandoned her
to the Dementors; and an imagination of a woman with long white
hair (had she looked like her husband?) falling amid the flames of
her bedroom, as a wand was held upon her and orange light reflected
from half-moon glasses.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore had seemed to think that Harry would be better
at that sort of thing than him.</p>
<p>And Harry knew that he probably would be. He knew the math,
after all.</p>
<p>But it was understood, somehow it was understood, that
utilitarian ethicists didn't <i>actually</i> rob banks so they
could give the money to the poor. The end result of throwing away
all ethical constraint wouldn't <i>actually</i> be sunshine and
roses and happiness for all. The prescription of consequentialism
was to take the action that led to the best net consequences, not
actions that had one positive consequence and wrecked everything
else along the way. Expected utility maximizers were allowed to
take common sense into account, when they were calculating their
expectations.</p>
<p>Somehow Harry had understood that, even before anyone else had
warned him he'd understood. Before he'd read about Vladimir Lenin
or the history of the French Revolution, he'd known. It might have
been his earliest science fiction books warning him about people
with good intentions, or maybe Harry had just seen the logic for
himself. Somehow he'd known from the very beginning, that if he
stepped outside his ethics <i>whenever there was a reason,</i> the
end result wouldn't be good.</p>
<p>A final image came to him, then: Lily Potter standing in front
of her baby's crib and measuring the intervals between outcomes:
the final outcome if she stayed and tried to curse her enemy (dead
Lily, dead Harry), the final outcome if she walked away (live Lily,
dead Harry), weighing the expected utilities, and making the only
sensible choice.</p>
<p>She would've been Harry's mother if she had.</p>
<p>"But human beings can't live like that," the boy's lips
whispered to the empty classroom. "Human beings can't live like
that."</p>

1</h3>
<p>When Padma entered the Transfiguration classroom, she saw that
half the class had beaten her there, a strange, deathly silence
pervading the room. Harry Potter sat alone in one corner, staring
off into some unknown distance, his eyes half-lidded, nearly
closed.</p>
<p>Rumor said that the Aurors had discovered that the Defense
Professor had Polyjuiced as Granger to fool Malfoy.</p>
<p>Rumor said that Hermione had been bound by the Unbreakable Vow
to be Draco Malfoy's slave.</p>
<p>Rumor said that Hermione had gotten the Dementor's Kiss.</p>
<p>But if <i>that</i> were true, Harry Potter wouldn't be sitting
there, he would be -</p>
<p>Padma didn't know what General Potter would do. Her mind went
blank, trying to think about it.</p>
<p>Even when Professor McGonagall got there, the silence hadn't
broken. The Transfiguration Professor walked up to the board
without a pause, erased it with a sweep of her hand, and then began
to write.</p>
<p>"Today, children," began the calm professional voice of the
Transfiguration Professor, just as though nothing out of the
ordinary had happened that week, "we shall learn how much effort it
takes to sustain a Transfiguration, and why, at your age, you
should not even try. The original Form is not gone, only
suppressed; and to maintain that suppression -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Padma Patil. She knew her voice was shaking,
she knew that she was trembling visibly, but she had to ask.
"Excuse me, Professor, what happened with Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>The Transfiguration Professor paused at the board, and turned to
look at Padma. The Professor should have looked stern, having been
interrupted without a hand being raised, but instead her face was
kindly. "You don't already know, Miss Patil? I expected that rumor
would have spread."</p>
<p>"There's too many rumors," said Padma. "I don't know what's
true."</p>
<p>Morag MacDougal raised her hand, then said without waiting to be
called, "I told you, Padma, what's <i>true</i> is that the
Wizengamot found Granger guilty and ordered her to get the
Dementor's Kiss and they brought in the Dementor and Harry Potter
glued it to the ceiling and wouldn't let it down until -"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear Merlin," said Professor McGonagall, her expression
growing sharp, but then she visibly calmed herself. "The affair was
utterly ridiculous and I shan't go into detail. Let it stand that
Miss Granger is resting with Madam Pomfrey for now, and coming back
to classes tomorrow. And if I catch anyone bothering her, I shall
turn them into glass vases and drop them."</p>
<p>The entire class gasped at this; it wasn't so much that the
threat was fatal, as that it broke the safety rules for
Transfiguration.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned back to her board -</p>
<p>From a corner of the classroom, another voice rose up. "What
about Professor Quirrell?" said Terry Boot. "Has he been
arrested?"</p>
<p>"The Aurors are only detaining him," said the Transfiguration
Professor without turning around. "If they have not given back our
Defense Professor by tomorrow, I shall ask the Headmaster to go
fetch him. Though I may as well tell you now that the Board of
Governors has scheduled a vote on whether Professor Quirrell's
battles shall be allowed to continue."</p>
<p>Kevin Entwhistle spoke. "And General Malfoy? When's he getting
back from St. Mungo's?"</p>
<p>The Transfiguration Professor paused in her drawing.</p>
<p>She turned around again, more slowly, this time.</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> sorry, Mr. Entwhistle," said Professor McGonagall.
Her face looked a little more lined than when she had entered the
room. "Mr. Malfoy's health is in no danger, I am given to
understand. Unfortunately, I have received an owl from Mr. Malfoy's
father withdrawing him from Hogwarts. I am afraid he is not coming
back."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="84">Chapter 84</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath
2</h3>
<p>When Hermione Granger woke, she found herself lying in a soft,
comfortable bed of the Hogwarts infirmary, with a square of setting
sunlight falling on her midriff, warm through the thin blanket.
Memory said that there would be a screen-sheet above her, either
drawn around her bed or open, and that the rest of Madam Pomfrey's
domain would lie beyond: the other beds, occupied or unoccupied,
and bright windows set in the curvily-carven stone of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>When Hermione opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the
face of Professor McGonagall, sitting on the left side of her bed.
Professor Flitwick wasn't there, but that was understandable, he'd
stayed by her side all morning in the detention cell, his silver
raven standing extra guard against the Dementor and his stern
little face always turned outward toward the Aurors. The Head of
Ravenclaw had surely spent way too much time on her, and probably
had to get back to teaching his classes, instead of keeping watch
on a convicted attempted-murderess.</p>
<p>She felt horribly, horribly sick and she didn't think it was
because of any potions. Hermione would've started crying again,
only her throat hurt, her eyes still burned, and her mind just felt
tired. She couldn't have borne to weep again, couldn't find the
strength for tears.</p>
<p>"Where are my parents?" Hermione whispered to the Head of House
Gryffindor. Somehow it seemed like the worst thing in the world to
face them, even worse than everything else; and yet she still
wanted to see them.</p>
<p>The gentle look on Professor McGonagall's face Transfigured into
something sadder. "I'm sorry, Miss Granger. Though it was not
always so, we have found in recent years that it is wiser not to
tell the parents of Muggleborns about any danger their child has
faced. I should advise you also to remain silent, if you wish to
stay at Hogwarts without trouble from them."</p>
<p>"I'm not being expelled?" the girl whispered. "For what I
did?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor McGonagall. "Miss Granger... surely you
heard... I hope you heard Mr. Potter, when he said that you were
innocent?"</p>
<p>"He was just saying that," she said dully. "To get me free, I
mean."</p>
<p>The older witch shook her head firmly. "No, Miss Granger. Mr.
Potter believes you were Memory-Charmed, that the whole duel never
happened. The Headmaster suspects even Darker magics may have been
involved - that your own hand might have cast the spell, but not
your own will. Even Professor Snape finds the affair completely
unbelievable, though he may not be able to say so publicly. He was
wondering if Muggle drugs might have been used on you."</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes went on staring distantly at the Transfiguration
Professor; she knew that she'd just been told something
significant, but she couldn't find the energy to propagate any
changes through her mind.</p>
<p>"Surely <i>you</i> don't believe it?" said Professor McGonagall.
"Miss Granger, you cannot believe of yourself that you would turn
to murder!"</p>
<p>"But I -" Her excellent memory helpfully replayed it for the
thousandth time, Draco Malfoy telling her with a sneer that she'd
never beat him when he wasn't tired, and then proceeding to prove
just that, dancing like a duelist between the warded trophies while
she frantically scrambled, and dealing the ending blow with a hex
that sent her crashing against the wall and drew blood from her
cheek - and then - then she'd -</p>
<p>"But you remember doing it," said the older witch, who was
watching over her with kindly understanding. "Miss Granger, there
is no need for a twelve-year-old girl to bear such dreadful
memories. Say the word and I shall be happy to lock them away for
you."</p>
<p>It was like a glass of warm water thrown into her face.
"What?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall took out her wand, a gesture so practiced
and quick that it seemed like pointing a finger. "I can't offer to
rid you of the memories entirely, Miss Granger," the
Transfiguration Professor said with her customary precision. "There
may be important facts buried there. But there is a form of the
Memory Charm which is reversible, and I shall be happy to cast that
on you."</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the wand, feeling the stirrings of hope for
the first time in almost two days.</p>
<p><i>Make it didn't happen...</i> she'd wished that over and over
again, for the hands of time to turn back and erase the horrible
choice that could never, ever be undone. And if erasing the memory
wasn't that, it was still a kind of release...</p>
<p>She looked back at Professor McGonagall's kindly face.</p>
<p>"You <i>really</i> don't think I did it?" Hermione said, her
voice trembling.</p>
<p>"I am <i>quite</i> certain you would never do such a thing of
your own will."</p>
<p>Beneath her blankets, Hermione's hands clutched at the sheets.
"<i>Harry</i> doesn't think I did it?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter is of the opinion that your memories are entire
fabrications. I can rather see his point."</p>
<p>Then Hermione's clutching fingers let go of the sheet, and she
slumped back into the bed, from which she'd partially risen.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>She hadn't said anything.</p>
<p>She'd woken up and remembered what had happened last night, and
it had been like - like - she couldn't find words even in her own
thoughts for what it had been like. But she'd known that Draco
Malfoy was already dead, and she hadn't said anything, hadn't gone
to Professor Flitwick and confessed. She'd just dressed herself and
gone down to breakfast and <i>tried to act normal</i> so that
nobody would ever know, and she'd known it was wrong and Wrong and
horribly horribly WRONG but she'd been so, so scared -</p>
<p>Even if Harry Potter was right, even if the duel with Draco
Malfoy was a lie, she'd made <i>that</i> choice all by herself. She
didn't deserve to forget that, or be forgiven for it.</p>
<p>And if she <i>had</i> done the right thing, gone straight to
Professor Flitwick, maybe that would've - helped, somehow, maybe
everyone would've seen then that she regretted it, and Harry
wouldn't have had to give away all his money to save her -</p>
<p>Hermione shut her eyes, squeezed them shut really tight, she
couldn't bear to start crying again. "I'm a horrible person," she
said in a wavering voice. "I'm awful, I'm not heroic at all -"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's voice was very sharp, like Hermione had
just made some dreadful mistake on her Transfiguration homework.
"Stop being foolish, Miss Granger! <i>Horrible</i> is whoever did
this to you. And as for being heroic - well, Miss Granger, you have
already heard my opinion about young girls trying to involve
themselves in such things before they are even fourteen, so I shall
not lecture you on it again. I shall say only that you have just
had an absolutely dreadful experience, which you survived as well
as any witch in your year possibly could. Today you are allowed to
cry as much as you like. Tomorrow you are going back to class."</p>
<p>That was when Hermione knew that Professor McGonagall couldn't
help her. She needed someone to scold her, she couldn't be absolved
if she couldn't be blamed, and Professor McGonagall would never do
that for her, would never ask so much of a little Ravenclaw
girl.</p>
<p>It was something Harry Potter wouldn't help her with either.</p>
<p>Hermione turned over in the infirmary bed, huddling into
herself, away from Professor McGonagall. "Please," she whispered.
"I want to talk - to the Headmaster -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hermione."</p>
<p>When Hermione Granger opened her eyes a second time, she saw the
care-lined face of Albus Dumbledore leaning over her bedside,
looking almost as though <i>he'd</i> been crying, though that was
impossible; and Hermione felt another stabbing pang of guilt for
having bothered him so.</p>
<p>"Minerva said you wished to speak with me," the old wizard
said.</p>
<p>"I -" Suddenly Hermione didn't know at all what to say. Her
throat locked up, and all she could do was stammer, "I - I'm -"</p>
<p>Somehow her tone must have communicated the other word, the one
she couldn't even say anymore.</p>
<p>"<i>Sorry?</i>" said Dumbledore. "Why, for what should you be
sorry?"</p>
<p>She had to force the words out of her throat. "You were telling
Harry - that he shouldn't pay - so <i>I</i> shouldn't - have done
what Professor McGonagall said, I shouldn't have touched his wand
-"</p>
<p>"My dear," said Dumbledore, "had you not pledged yourself to the
House of Potter, Harry would have attacked Azkaban singlehandedly,
and quite possibly won. That boy may choose his words carefully,
but I have never yet known him to lie; and in the Boy-Who-Lived
there is power that the Dark Lord never knew. He would indeed have
tried to break Azkaban, even at cost of his life." The old wizard's
voice grew gentler, and kinder. "No, Hermione, you have nothing at
all for which to blame yourself."</p>
<p>"I could have <i>made</i> him not do it."</p>
<p>In Dumbledore's eyes a small twinkle appeared before it was lost
to weariness. "Really, Miss Granger? Perhaps you should be
Headmistress in my place, for I myself have no such power over
stubborn children."</p>
<p>"Harry promised -" Her voice stopped. The awful truth was very
hard to speak. "Harry Potter promised me - that he would never help
me - if I told him not to."</p>
<p>There was a pause. The distant noises of the infirmary that had
accompanied Professor McGonagall had ceased, Hermione realized,
when Dumbledore had awoken her. From where she lay in bed she could
see only the ceiling, and the top of one wall's windows, but
nothing in her range of vision moved, and if there were sounds, she
could not hear them.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Dumbledore. The old wizard sighed heavily. "I suppose
it <i>is</i> possible that the boy would have kept his
promise."</p>
<p>"I should - I should've -"</p>
<p>"Gone to Azkaban of your own will?" Dumbledore said. "Miss
Granger, that is more than I would ever ask anyone to take upon
themselves."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione swallowed. She couldn't help but notice the
loophole, anyone who wanted to get through the portrait-door to the
Ravenclaw dorm quickly learned to pay attention to exact wordings.
"But it's not more than you'd take on <i>yourself</i>."</p>
<p>"Hermione -" the old wizard began.</p>
<p>"Why?" said Hermione's voice, it seemed to be running on without
her mind, now. "Why couldn't I be braver? I was going to run in
front of the Dementor - for Harry - before, I mean, in January - so
why - why - why couldn't I -" Why had the thought of being sent to
Azkaban just completely <i>unglued</i> her, why had she forgotten
everything about being Good -</p>
<p>"My dear girl," Dumbledore said. The blue eyes behind the
half-moon glasses showed a complete understanding of her guilt. "I
would have done no better myself, in my first year in Hogwarts. As
you would be kind to others, be kinder to yourself as well."</p>
<p>"So I <i>did</i> do the wrong thing." Somehow she needed to say
that, to be told that, even though she already knew.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Listen, young Ravenclaw," the old wizard said, "hear me well,
for I shall speak to you a truth. Most ill-doers do not think of
themselves as evil; indeed, most conceive themselves the heroes of
the stories they tell. I once thought that the greatest evil in
this world was done in the name of the greater good. I was wrong.
Terribly wrong. There is evil in this world which knows itself for
evil, and hates the good with all its strength. All fair things
does it desire to destroy."</p>
<p>Hermione shivered in her bed, somehow it seemed very real, when
Dumbledore said it.</p>
<p>The old wizard continued speaking. "You are one of the fair
things of this world, Hermione Granger, and so that evil hates you
as well. If you had stayed firm through even this trial, it would
have struck you harder and yet harder, until you shattered. Do not
think that heroes cannot be broken! We are only more difficult to
break, Hermione." The old wizard's eyes had grown sterner than she
had ever seen. "When you have been exhausted for many hours, when
pain and death is not a passing fear but a certainty, then it is
harder to be a hero. If I must speak the truth - then today, yes, I
would not waver in the face of Azkaban. But when I was a first-year
in Hogwarts - I would have fled from the Dementor that you
confronted, for my father had died in Azkaban, and I feared them.
Know this! The evil that struck at you could have broken anyone,
even myself. Only Harry Potter has it within him to face that
horror, when he has come fully into his power."</p>
<p>Hermione's neck couldn't stare at the old wizard any longer; she
let her head fall back, back to the pillow, where she stared up at
the ceiling, absorbing what she could.</p>
<p>"Why?" Her voice trembled again. "Why would anyone be that evil?
I don't understand."</p>
<p>"I, too, have wondered," said Dumbledore's voice, a deep sadness
in it. "For thrice ten years I wondered, and I still do not
understand. You and I will never understand, Hermione Granger. But
at least I know now what true evil would say for itself, if we
could speak to it and ask why it was evil. It would say, <i>Why
not?</i>"</p>
<p>A brief flare of indignation inside her. "There's got to be a
<i>million</i> reasons why not!"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Dumbledore's voice. "A million reasons and more.
We will always know those reasons, you and I. If you insist on
putting it that way - then yes, Hermione, this day's trial broke
you. But what happens <i>after</i> you break - that, too, is part
of being a hero. Which you are, Hermione Granger, and will always
be."</p>
<p>She raised her head again, staring at him.</p>
<p>The old wizard got up from beside her bed. His silver beard
dipped down, as Dumbledore bowed to her gravely, and left.</p>
<p>She went on looking at where the old wizard had gone.</p>
<p>It should have meant something to her, should have touched her.
Should have made her felt better inside, that Dumbledore, who had
seemed so reluctant before, had now acknowledged her as a hero.</p>
<p>She felt nothing.</p>
<p>Hermione let her head fall back to the bed, as Madam Pomfrey
came and made her drink something that seared her lips like the
afterburn of spicy food, and smelled even hotter, and didn't taste
like anything at all. It meant nothing to her. She went on staring
up at the distant stone tiles of the ceiling.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva was waiting, doing her best not to hover, beside the
double doors to the Hogwarts infirmary, she'd always thought of
those doors as "the ominous gates" as a child in Hogwarts, and
couldn't help but remember that now. Too much bad news had been
spoken here -</p>
<p>Albus stepped out. The old wizard did not pause on the way out
of the infirmary, only kept walking toward Professor Flitwick's
office; and Minerva followed him.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. "Is it done,
Albus?"</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded in affirmation. "If any hostile magic is
cast on her, or any spirit touches her, I shall know, and
come."</p>
<p>"I spoke to Mr. Potter after Transfiguration class," said
Professor McGonagall. "He was of the opinion that Miss Granger
should go to Beauxbatons, rather than Hogwarts, from now on."</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head. "No. If Voldemort truly desires
to strike at Miss Granger - he is tenacious beyond measure. His
servants are returning to him, he could not have retrieved
Bellatrix alone. Azkaban itself is not safe from his malice, and as
for Beauxbatons - no, Minerva. I do not think Voldemort can essay
such possessions often, or against stronger targets, or this year
would have gone quite differently. And Harry Potter is here, whom
Voldemort must fear whether he admits it or no. Now that I have
warded her, Miss Granger will be safer within Hogwarts than
without."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter seemed to doubt that," Minerva said. She couldn't
quite keep the edge from her voice; there was a part of her that
agreed rather strongly. "He seemed to feel that common sense said
Miss Granger should continue her education anywhere but
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. "I fear the boy has spent too much time
among the Muggles. Always they reach for safety; always they
imagine that safety can be reached. If Miss Granger is not safe
within the center of our fortress, she shall be no safer for
leaving it."</p>
<p>"Not everyone seems to think so," said Professor McGonagall. It
had been almost the first letter she'd seen when she'd taken a
quick look at her desk; an envelope of the finest sheepskin, sealed
in greenish-silver wax, pressed into the image of a snake that rose
and hissed at her. "I have received Lord Malfoy's owl withdrawing
his son from Hogwarts."</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded, but did not break stride. "Does Harry
know?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Her voice faltered, for a moment, remembering Harry's
expression. "After class, Mr. Potter complimented Lord Malfoy's
excellent good sense, and said that he would be writing Madam
Longbottom advising her to do the same with her grandson, in case
he was the next target. In the event that Mr. Longbottom's guardian
was so negligent as to keep him in Hogwarts, Mr. Potter wanted him
to have a Time-Turner, an invisibility cloak, a broomstick, and a
pouch in which to carry them; also a toe-ring with an emergency
portkey to a safe location, in case someone kidnaps Mr. Longbottom
and takes him outside Hogwarts's wards. I told Mr. Potter that I
did not think the Ministry would consent to such use of our
Time-Turners, and he said that we should not ask. I expect he will
want Miss Granger to receive the same, if she stays. And for
himself Mr. Potter wants a three-person broomstick to carry in his
pouch." She wasn't awed by the list of precautions. Impressed with
the cleverness, but not awed; she was a Transfiguration Mistress,
after all. But it still sent shivers of disquiet through her, that
Harry Potter now thought Hogwarts as dangerous as spell
research.</p>
<p>"The Department of Mysteries is not lightly defied," said Albus.
"But for the rest -" The old wizard seemed to slump in on himself
slightly. "We may as well give the boy what he wishes. And I will
ward Neville also, and write Augusta to say that he should stay
here over holiday."</p>
<p>"And finally," she said, "Mr. Potter says - this is a direct
quote, Albus - whatever kind of Dark Wizard attractant the
Headmaster is keeping here, he needs to get it out of this school,
<i>now</i>." She couldn't stop the edge in her own voice, that
time.</p>
<p>"I asked as much of Flamel," Albus said, the pain clear in his
voice. "But Master Flamel has said - that even <i>he</i> can no
longer keep safe the Stone - that he believes Voldemort has means
of finding it wherever it is hidden - and that he does not consent
for it to be guarded anywhere but Hogwarts. Minerva, I am sorry,
but it must be done - <i>must!</i>"</p>
<p>"Very well," said Professor McGonagall. "But for myself, I think
that Mr. Potter is right on every single count."</p>
<p>The old wizard glanced at her, and his voice caught as he said,
"Minerva, you have known me long, and as well as any soul still
living - tell me, have I lost myself to darkness already?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Professor McGonagall in genuine surprise. Then,
"Oh, Albus, no!"</p>
<p>The old wizard's lips pressed together tightly before he spoke.
"For the greater good. I have sacrificed so many, for the greater
good. Today I almost condemned Hermione Granger to Azkaban for the
greater good. And I find myself - today, I found myself - beginning
to resent the innocence that is no longer mine -" The old wizard's
voice halted. "Evil done in the name of good. Evil done in the name
of evil. Which <i>is</i> worse?"</p>
<p>"You are being silly, Albus."</p>
<p>The old wizard glanced at her again, before turning his eyes
back to their way. "Tell me, Minerva - did you pause to weigh the
consequences, before you told Miss Granger how to bind herself to
the Potter family?"</p>
<p>She took an involuntary breath as she understood what she had
done -</p>
<p>"So you did not." Albus's eyes were saddened. "No, Minerva, you
must not apologize. It is well. For what you have seen of me this
day - if your first loyalty is now to Harry Potter, and not to me,
then that is right and proper." She opened her lips to protest, but
Albus went on before she could say a word. "Indeed - indeed - that
will be necessary and more than necessary, if the Dark Lord that
Harry must defeat to come into his power is not Voldemort after all
-"</p>
<p>"Not <i>this</i> again!" Minerva said. "Albus, it was
You-Know-Who, not you, who marked Harry as his equal. There is no
<i>possible</i> way that the prophecy could be talking about
you!"</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded, but his eyes still seemed distant, fixed
only on the road ahead.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The holding cell, well to the center of Magical Law Enforcement,
was luxuriously appointed; more a remark on what adult wizards took
for granted, than any special feeling toward prisoners. There was a
self-reclining, self-rocking chair with plush, richly textured,
self-warming cushions. There was a bookcase containing random books
rescued from a bargain bin, and a full shelf of ancient magazines,
including one from 1883. As for toiletries, well, it wasn't exactly
luxurious, but there was a spell on the room which put all that
business on hold; you weren't to go anywhere that the watching
Auror couldn't see you. But aside from that, it was quite a
pleasant little cell. The Defense Professor of Hogwarts was being
detained, not arrested, not even intimidated. There was no evidence
to indict him... except that a terrible and unusual crime had been
committed at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and
going by previous occasions the odds were five to one that the
current Defense Professor was tangled up in it <i>somehow</i>. To
this must be added the fact that nobody in the D.M.L.E. even knew
who the Defense Professor <i>was</i>, and that the man had
literally <i>sneezed</i> at all attempts to uncover his true
identity. Why, no, they <i>hadn't</i> released 'Quirinus Quirrell'
back to Hogwarts just yet.</p>
<p>Let us repeat this for emphasis:</p>
<p>The Defense Professor.</p>
<p>Was being detained.</p>
<p>In a cell.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was staring at the watching Auror and
humming.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor has not spoken a single word since he
arrived in this particular cell. He has <i>only</i> been
humming.</p>
<p>The humming started as a simple children's lullaby, the one that
in Muggle Britain begins, <i>Lullaby, and goodnight...</i></p>
<p>This tune was hummed, without variation, over and over, for
seven minutes, to establish the underlying pattern.</p>
<p>Then began the elaborations upon the theme. Phrases hummed too
slow, with long pauses in between, so that the listener's mind
helplessly waits and waits for the next note, the next phrase. And
then, when that next phrase comes, it is so out of key, so
unbelievably awfully out of key, not just out of key for the
previous phrases but sung at a pitch which does not correspond to
<i>any</i> key, that you would have to believe this person had
spent hours deliberately practicing their humming just to acquire
such perfect anti-pitch.</p>
<p>It bears the same semblance to music as the awful dead voice of
a Dementor bears to human speech.</p>
<p>And this horrible, horrible humming is <i>impossible</i> to
ignore. It is similar to a known lullaby, but it departs from that
pattern unpredictably. It sets up expectations and then violates
them, never in any constant pattern that would permit the humming
to fade into the background. The listener's brain cannot prevent
itself from expecting the anti-musical phrases to complete, nor
prevent itself from noticing the surprises.</p>
<p>The only possible explanation for how this mode of humming came
to exist is that it was deliberately designed by some unspeakably
cruel genius who woke up one day, feeling bored with ordinary
torture, who decided to handicap himself and find out whether he
could break someone's sanity <i>just by humming at them</i>.</p>
<p>The Auror has been listening to this unimaginably dreadful
humming for four hours, while being stared at by a huge, cold,
lethal presence that feels equally horrible whether he looks at it
directly or lets it hover at the corner of his vision -</p>
<p>The humming stopped.</p>
<p>There was a long wait. Time enough for false hope to rise, and
be squashed down by the memory of previous disappointments. And
then, as the interval lengthened, and lengthened, that hope rose
again unstoppably -</p>
<p>The humming began once more.</p>
<p>The Auror cracked.</p>
<p>From his belt, the Auror took a mirror, tapped it once, and then
said, "This is Junior Auror Arjun Altunay, I'm calling in code
RJ-L20 on cell three."</p>
<p>"Code RJ-L20?" the mirror said in surprised tones. There was a
sound of pages being flipped, then, "You want to be relieved
because a prisoner is attempting psychological warfare and
succeeding?"</p>
<p>(Amelia Bones really is quite intelligent.)</p>
<p>"What'd the prisoner say to you?" said the mirror.</p>
<p>(This question is <i>not</i> part of procedure RJ-L20, but
unfortunately Amelia Bones has failed to include an explicit
instruction that the commanding officer should not ask.)</p>
<p>"He's -" said the Auror, and glanced back at the cell. The
Defense Professor was now leaning in back in his chair, looking
quite relaxed. "He was <i>staring</i> at me! And
<i>humming!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>The mirror spoke again. "And you're calling in an RJ-L20 over
that? You're sure you're not just trying to get out of watching
him?"</p>
<p>(Amelia Bones is surrounded by idiots.)</p>
<p>"You don't understand!" yelled Auror Altunay. "It's really awful
humming!"</p>
<p>The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the
background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.
Then speech again. "Mr. Altunay, if you don't want to be busted to
Junior Auror Second Class, I suggest you buckle down and get back
to work -"</p>
<p>"Strike that," a crisp voice said, sounding slightly remote due
to its distance from the mirror.</p>
<p>(Which is why Amelia Bones often sits in on a coordination
center of the D.M.L.E. while doing her Ministry-required
paperwork.)</p>
<p>"Auror Altunay," said the crisp voice, seeming to approach
closer to the mirror, "you will be relieved shortly. Auror Ben
Gutierrez, the procedure for RJ-L20 does <i>not</i> say that you
ask why. It says that you relieve the Auror who calls it in.
<i>If</i> I find that Aurors seem to be abusing it, <i>I</i> will
modify the procedure to prevent its abuse -" The mirror cut off
abruptly.</p>
<p>The Auror turned back to look triumphantly at where the current
Defense Professor of Hogwarts was leaning back in his cushioned
chair.</p>
<p>That man then spoke the first words that had left his lips since
he entered the cell.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Mr. Altunay," said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the door to the detention cell opened, and
in walked a grey-haired woman, dressed in the crimson-tinged robes
of an Auror without any sign of rank or other ornamentation,
carrying a black leather folder under her left arm. "You're
relieved," the old woman said abruptly.</p>
<p>There was a brief delay while Auror Altunay tried to explain
what had been happening. This was cut short by a nod and a stark,
simple finger pointing out the door.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Madam Director," said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>Amelia Bones did not acknowledge this statement, but sat down
abruptly in the vacated chair. The old witch opened the black
folder and her gaze moved down to the parchments therein. "Possible
hints to the identity of the current Hogwarts Defense Professor, as
compiled by Auror Robards." The title parchment was turned, flipped
aside. "The Defense Professor said that he was Sorted into
Slytherin. Claimed that his family was killed by Voldemort. Said he
had studied at a martial arts center in Muggle Asia which was
destroyed by Voldemort. A request filed with the Department of
International Magical Cooperation identifies this incident as the
Oni Affair of 1969." Another parchment was flipped aside. "It also
seems this Defense Professor gave a most stirring speech to his
students, just before last Yule, castigating the previous
generation for their disunity against the Death Eaters." The old
witch looked up from the leather folder. "Madam Longbottom was
rather taken with it, and insisted that I read the entire thing.
The argument struck me as familiar, though I could not place it at
the time. But then, of course, I had thought you dead."</p>
<p>The chief law enforcement officer of Magical Britain was now
gazing sharply at the current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, across
the pane of spell-reinforced glass separating them. The man in the
cell returned the gaze equably, without apparent alarm.</p>
<p>"I shall not name any names," said the old witch. "But I shall
tell a story, and see if it sounds familiar." Amelia Bones looked
back down, turning to the next parchment. "Born 1927, entered
Hogwarts in 1938, sorted into Slytherin, graduated 1945. Went on a
graduation tour abroad and disappeared while visiting Albania.
Presumed dead until 1970, when he returned to magical Britain just
as suddenly, without any explanation for the missing twenty-five
years. He remained estranged from his family and friends, living in
isolation. In 1971, while visiting Diagon Alley, he fended off an
attempt by Bellatrix Black to kidnap the daughter of the Minister
of Magic, and used the Killing Curse to slay two of the three Death
Eaters accompanying her. Beyond this all Britain knows the story;
need I continue it?" The old witch looked up from her folder again.
"Very well. There was a trial in the Wizengamot, during which this
young man was exonerated for his use of the Killing Curse, not
least due to the efforts of his grandmother, the Lady of his House.
He was reconciled with his family, and they held a House gathering
to welcome his return. The guest of honor arrived at that gathering
to find his entire family slain by Death Eaters, even to the house
elves; and that he himself, of cadet line, was now the last
remaining scion of a Most Ancient House."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had not reacted at all to any of this,
except that his eyes had half-closed, as though in weariness.</p>
<p>"The young man took up his family's seat in the Wizengamot,
becoming among the most steadfast voices against You-Know-Who.
Several times he led forces against the Death Eaters, fighting with
skillful tactics and extraordinary power. People began to speak of
him as the next Dumbledore, it was thought that he might become
Minister of Magic after the Dark Lord fell. On the third of July,
1973, he failed to appear at a key Wizengamot vote, and was never
heard from again. We assumed You-Know-Who had killed him. It was a
grave blow to all of us, and matters went much the worse from that
day on." The old witch's gaze was questioning. "I mourned you
myself. What happened?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's shoulders moved lightly, a small shrug.
"You make many assumptions," the Defense Professor said softly.
"For myself, I would believe that man died years ago. But if that
man is nonetheless alive - then it is clear he does not wish the
fact announced, and has reasons enough for silence. That man was
once of some help to you, it seems." The Defense Professor's lips
curved in a cynical smile. "But I am no longer surprised when
gratitude is fleeting. Is there yet more that you would demand from
him?"</p>
<p>The old witch leaned back in her Auror's monitoring-chair,
looking rather startled, maybe even hurt. "No -" she said after a
moment. Her fingers tapped the leather folder; <i>nervously,</i>
you might have thought, if you had believed that Amelia Bones could
ever be nervous. "But your <i>House</i> - there are not many
Ancient Houses remaining -"</p>
<p>"It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient
Houses remain, or seven."</p>
<p>The old witch sighed. "What does Dumbledore think of this?"</p>
<p>The man in the detention cell shook his head. "He does not know
who I am, and promised not to inquire."</p>
<p>The old witch's eyebrows rose. "How did he identify you to the
Hogwarts wards, then?"</p>
<p>A slight smile. "The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts
that he who stood within was the Defense Professor. Speaking of
which -" The tone went lower, flatter. "I am missing my classes,
Director Bones."</p>
<p>"You seem to - <i>rest</i>, sometimes, in a peculiar manner.
This has also been reported. And you seem to be <i>resting</i> more
and more frequently, as time goes on." The old witch's fingers
tapped the leather folder again. "I cannot recall reading of such a
symptom, but when one hears of such a thing, one imagines... Dark
Wizards fought, and terrible curses received..."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor remained expressionless.</p>
<p>"Do you require a healer's help?" said Amelia Bones. Her own
mask had slipped, clearly showing the pain in her eyes. "Is there
anything at all that can be done for you?"</p>
<p>"I agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts," the man in the cell
said flatly. "Draw your own conclusions, Madam. And I am missing my
classes, of which there are not many left. I would return to
Hogwarts, now."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Hermione woke the third time (though it felt like she'd
only closed her eyes for a moment) the Sun was even lower in the
sky, almost fully set. She felt a little more alive and, strangely,
even more exhausted. This time it was Professor Flitwick who was
standing next to her bed and shaking her shoulder, a tray of
steaming food floating next to him. For some reason she'd thought
Harry Potter ought to be leaning over her bedside, but he wasn't
there. Had she dreamed that? She couldn't remember dreaming.</p>
<p>It developed (according to Professor Flitwick) that Hermione had
missed dinner in the Great Hall, and was being woken to eat. And
then she could go back to the Ravenclaw dorm, and her own bed, to
sleep the rest of the night.</p>
<p>She ate in silence. There was a part of her that wanted to ask
Professor Flitwick whether <i>he</i> thought she'd been
Memory-Charmed or she'd tried to kill Draco Malfoy of her own will
-</p>
<p><i>- like she remembered doing -</i></p>
<p>- but most of her was afraid to find out. <i>Afraid to find
out</i> was a warning sign, according to Harry Potter and his
books; but her mind felt tired, <i>bruised,</i> and she couldn't
muster the strength to override it.</p>
<p>When she and Professor Flitwick left the infirmary they found
Harry Potter sitting cross-legged outside the door, quietly reading
a psychology textbook.</p>
<p>"I'll take her from here," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "Professor
McGonagall said it would be all right."</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick seemed to accept this, and departed after a
stern look at both of them. She couldn't imagine what the stern
look was supposed to say, unless it was <i>don't try to kill any
more students.</i></p>
<p>The footsteps of Professor Flitwick faded, and the two of them
stood alone outside the doors of the infirmary.</p>
<p>She looked at the green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived, the mess of
hair that didn't quite obscure the scar on his forehead; she looked
upon the face of the boy who'd given all his money to save her
without a second thought. There were feelings inside her - guilt,
shame, embarrassment, other things as well - but no words. There
was nothing she knew how to say.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said abruptly, "I did a quick skim through my
psychology books to see what they said about post-traumatic stress
disorder. The old books said you should talk about the experience
immediately afterward with a counselor. The newer research says
that when they actually ran experiments, it turned out that talking
about it immediately afterward made it worse. Apparently what you
really ought to do is run with your mind's natural impulse to
repress the memories and just not think about it for a while."</p>
<p>It was so <i>normal</i> for the way she and Harry usually talked
that she felt a sudden burning in her throat.</p>
<p><i>We don't have to talk about it.</i> That was what Harry had
just said, more or less. It felt like cheating, maybe even like a
lie. Nothing <i>was</i> normal. Everything wrong was still horribly
wrong, everything left unsaid still needed to be said...</p>
<p>"Okay," said Hermione, because there wasn't anything else to
say, anything else at all.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I wasn't waiting when you woke up," Harry said, as
they started to walk. "Madam Pomfrey wouldn't let me in, so I just
stayed out here." He gave a small, sad-looking shrug. "I suppose I
should be out there trying to run damage control on public
relations, but... honestly I've never been good at that, I just end
up speaking sharply at people."</p>
<p>"How bad is it?" She thought her voice should have come out in a
whisper, a croak, but it didn't.</p>
<p>"Well -" Harry said with obvious hesitation. "The thing you've
got to understand, Hermione, is that you had a lot of defenders at
breakfast-time today, but everyone on your side was... <i>making
stuff up</i>. Draco tried to kill you first, things like that. It
was Granger versus Malfoy, that's how people saw it, like a seesaw
where pushing his side down meant pushing your side up. I told them
you were probably <i>both</i> innocent, that you'd both been
Memory-Charmed. They didn't listen, both sides treated me like a
traitor trying to play the middle. And then people heard that Draco
had testified under Veritaserum that he'd been trying to help you
before the battle - stop making that expression, Hermione, you
didn't actually do anything to him. Anyway, all people understood
was that the pro-Malfoy faction had been right and the pro-Granger
faction had been wrong." Harry gave a small sigh. "I <i>told</i>
them that when the truth came out later they'd be
embarrassed..."</p>
<p>"How bad is it?" she said again. This time her voice did come
out weaker.</p>
<p>"Remember Asch's conformity experiment?" Harry said, turning his
head to give her a serious look.</p>
<p>Her mind was <i>slow to remember</i> for a few seconds, which
frightened her, but then the reference came back. In 1951, Solomon
Asch had taken some experimental subjects, and each one had been
put among a row of other people who looked like them, seeming like
other experimental subjects, but actually confederates of the
experimenter. They'd shown a reference line on a screen, labeled X,
next to three other lines, labeled A, B, and C. The experimenter
had asked which line X was the same length as. The correct answer
had obviously been C. The other 'subjects', the confederates, had
one after another said that X was the same length as B. The real
subject had been put second-to-last in the order, so as not to
arouse suspicion by being last. The test had been to see whether
the real subject would 'conform' to the standard wrong answer of B,
or voice the obviously correct answer of C.</p>
<p>75% of the subjects had 'conformed' at least once. A third of
the subjects had conformed more than half the time. Some had
reported afterward actually believing that X was the same length as
B. And that had been in a case where the subjects hadn't known any
of the confederates. If you put people around others who belonged
to the same group as them, like someone in a wheelchair next to
other people in a wheelchair, the conformity effect got even
stronger...</p>
<p>Hermione had a sickening feeling where this was going. "I
remember," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I gave the Chaos Legion anti-conformity training, you know. I
had each Legionnaire stand in the middle and say 'Twice two is
four!' or 'Grass is green!' while everyone else in the Chaos Legion
called them idiots or sneered at them - Allen Flint did really good
sneers - or even just gave them blank looks and then walked away.
The thing you've got to remember is, <i>only</i> the Chaos Legion
has ever practiced anything like that. Nobody else in Hogwarts even
knows what conformity <i>is.</i>"</p>
<p>"Harry!" Her voice was wobbling. "How bad <i>is</i> it?"</p>
<p>Harry gave another sad-looking shrug. "Everyone in the second
year and above, since they don't know you. Everyone in Dragon Army.
All of Slytherin, of course. And, well, most of the rest of magical
Britain too, I think. Remember, Lucius Malfoy controls the <i>Daily
Prophet</i>."</p>
<p>"Everyone?" she whispered. Her limbs had started to feel cold,
like she'd just gotten out of an unheated swimming pool.</p>
<p>"What people really believe doesn't feel like a <i>belief</i>,
it feels like the way the world <i>is.</i> You and I are standing
in a private little bubble of the universe where Hermione Granger
got Memory-Charmed. Everyone else is living in the world where
Hermione Granger tried to murder Draco Malfoy. If Ernie Macmillian
-"</p>
<p>Her breath caught in her throat. <i>Captain Macmillian -</i></p>
<p>"- thinks he's ethically prohibited from being your friend now,
well, he's trying to do the right thing as he understands it, in
the world he thinks he lives in." Harry's eyes were very serious.
"Hermione, you've told me a lot of times that I look down too much
on other people. But if I expected too much of them - if I expected
people to get things <i>right</i> - I really would hate them, then.
Idealism aside, Hogwarts students don't <i>actually</i> know enough
cognitive science to take responsibility for how their own minds
work. It's not their fault they're crazy." Harry's voice was
strangely gentle, almost like an adult's. "I know it's going to be
harder on you than it would be on me. But remember, eventually the
real culprit gets nailed. The truth comes out, everyone who was
confidently wrong gets embarrassed."</p>
<p>"And if the real culprit doesn't get caught?" she said in a
trembling voice.</p>
<p><i>...or if it turns out to be me after all?</i></p>
<p>"Then you can leave Hogwarts and go to the Salem Witches'
Institute in America."</p>
<p>"<i>Leave Hogwarts?</i>" She'd never even thought of that
possibility except as an ultimate punishment.</p>
<p>"I... Hermione, I think you might want to do that anyway.
Hogwarts isn't a castle, it's insanity with walls. You <i>have</i>
got other options."</p>
<p>"I'll..." she stammered. "I'll have... to think about it..."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. " At least nobody's going to try hexing you, not
after what the Headmaster said at dinner tonight. Oh, and Ron
Weasley came up to me, looking very serious, and told me that if I
saw you first, I should tell you that he's sorry for having thought
badly of you, and he'll never speak ill of you again."</p>
<p>"<i>Ron</i> believes I'm innocent?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Well... he doesn't think you're <i>innocent,</i> per se..."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The whole Ravenclaw dorm went silent as the two of them walked
in.</p>
<p>Staring at them.</p>
<p>Staring at her.</p>
<p>(She'd had nightmares like this.)</p>
<p>And then, one by one, people looked away from her.</p>
<p>Penelope Clearwater, the 5th-year prefect in charge of
first-years, looked away slowly and deliberately, turning her head
to face in another direction.</p>
<p>Su Li and Lisa Turpin and Michael Corner, all sitting at a table
together, all of whom she'd helped with their homework at one time
or another, all looked away, their faces suddenly nervous, the
moment she tried to catch their eyes.</p>
<p>A third-year witch named Latisha Randle, whom S.P.H.E.W. had
twice saved from Slytherin bullies, quickly bent back over her desk
and started doing homework again.</p>
<p>Mandy Brocklehurst looked away from her.</p>
<p>If Hermione didn't burst into tears, then, it was only because
she'd expected it, had played it out in her mind over and over
again. At least people weren't screaming at her or shoving her or
hexing her. They were just looking away -</p>
<p>Hermione walked very straight up to the staircaise that led
toward the first-year girl's dorms. (She didn't see Padma Patil or
Anthony Goldstein looking at her, those two lone heads turning to
track her as she left.) From behind her, she heard Harry Potter
saying in a very calm tone, "Now eventually the truth's going to
come out, you all. So if you're all that confident she's guilty,
can I ask you all to sign this paper right here, saying that if she
later turns out to be innocent, she gets to say 'I told you so' and
then hold it over you for the rest of your lives? Step on up, one
and all, don't be cowards, if you really believe you shouldn't be
afraid to bet -"</p>
<p>She was halfway up the stairs when she realized that there would
be other girls inside her dorm room, too.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The stars hadn't quite come out yet, only one or two of the
brightest ones visible through the reddish-purple haze of the
horizon, though the sun had fully sunk.</p>
<p>Hermione's hands dug into the harsh stone of the parapet
guarding the small balcony, where she'd ducked out of the stairwell
after realizing that -</p>
<p>- <i>she couldn't just go back to bed</i> -</p>
<p>- the words echoed in her mind like 'You can't go home again'
ought to sound.</p>
<p>She stared out at the empty grounds, the fading sunset, the
sprouting grass so far below.</p>
<p>Tired, she was tired, she couldn't think now, she needed to
sleep. Professor Flitwick had told her that she needed to sleep,
and there'd been yet another potion with her dinner. Maybe that was
how wizarding society treated horrible traumas to innocent young
girls, just made them sleep a lot afterward.</p>
<p>She should go to her room and sleep, but she was afraid to go
someplace where other people were. Afraid of how they might look at
her, or look away.</p>
<p>Fragments of thought chased themselves around a mind too
exhausted to finish or connect them, as the night fully set in.</p>
<p><i>Why -</i></p>
<p><i>Why did all this happen -</i></p>
<p><i>Everything was fine a week ago -</i></p>
<p><i>Why -</i></p>
<p>From behind her came the creaky sound of an opening door.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was leaning against the doorway she'd walked
through, silhouetted like a cardboard cutout by the light of the
Hogwarts torches lit behind him, in the open door. She couldn't see
his expression, though the doorway behind him was bright; his eyes,
his face, everything she could see from here lay within night's
shadow.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor of Hogwarts, number one on the list of
people who might've done this. She hadn't even realized she
<i>had</i> a suspect list until that moment.</p>
<p>The man stood within that doorway, saying nothing; and she
couldn't see his eyes. What was he even <i>doing</i> there in the
first place -</p>
<p>"Are you here to kill me?" said Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's head tilted at that.</p>
<p>Then the Defense Professor started toward her, the dark
silhouette raising one hand slowly and deliberately, as though to
push her off the Ravenclaw tower -</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>The burst of adrenaline overrode everything, she drew her wand
without thinking, her lips formed the word of their own accord, the
stunbolt leapt out of her wand and -</p>
<p>- <i>slowed to a stop</i> in front of Professor Quirrell's
raised hand, rippling in midair like it was still trying to fly and
making a slight hissing sound.</p>
<p>The red glow illuminated Professor Quirrell's face for the first
time, showing a strange fond smile.</p>
<p>"Better," said Professor Quirrell. "Miss Granger, you are still
a student in my Defense class. As such, if you consider me a
threat, I do not expect you to just look at me sadly and ask if I
am there to kill you. Minus two Quirrell points."</p>
<p>She was entirely unable to form words.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor flicked his forefinger casually at the
suspended stunbolt, sending the hex shooting back over her head,
far into the night, so that they stood again in darkness. Then
Professor Quirrell walked out of the doorway, which swung shut
behind him; and a soft white light sprung up around the two of
them, so that she could see his face once more, still with that
strange fond smile.</p>
<p>"What are you - what are you <i>doing</i> here?"</p>
<p>A few more steps took Professor Quirrell to a higher part of the
balcony's ramparts, where he put his elbows down on the stone, and
leaned over heavily, looking up into the night.</p>
<p>"I came here straight upon being released by the Aurors, the
moment I finished reporting to the Headmaster," said Professor
Quirrell in a quiet voice, "because I am your teacher, and you are
my student, and I am responsible for you."</p>
<p>Hermione understood, then; remembering what Professor Quirrell
had said to Harry in the second Defense lesson of the year, about
controlling his anger. She felt the flush of shame all the way down
her chest. It took a moment after that for knowledge to override
mortification, for her to force out the words -</p>
<p>"I -" said Hermione. "Harry thinks - that I <i>didn't</i> - lose
my temper, I mean -"</p>
<p>"So I heard," said Professor Quirrell in rather dry tones. He
shook his head, as though at the stars themselves. "The boy is
fortunate that I have crossed the line from annoyance with his
self-destructiveness, into sheer curiosity as to what he shall do
next. But I agree with Mr. Potter's assessment of the facts. This
murder was well-planned to evade detection both by the wards of
Hogwarts and the Headmaster's timely eye. Naturally, in such a
thoughtful murder, some innocent would be placed to take the
blame." A brief, wry smile crossed the Defense Professor's lips,
though he wasn't looking at her. "As for the notion that you did it
yourself - I consider myself a talented teacher, but even I could
not teach such murderous intent to a student as obstinate and
untalented as Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>The part of her brain that said <i>What?</i> in indignation
wasn't anywhere near loud enough to reach her lips.</p>
<p>"No..." said Professor Quirrell. "That is not why I am here. You
have made no effort to hide your dislike for me, Miss Granger. I
thank you for that lack of pretense, for I much prefer true hate to
false love. But you are still my student, and I have a word to say
to you, if you will hear it."</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him, still fighting down the aftereffects of
the adrenaline from before. The Defense Professor seemed to be just
staring up at the dark sky, in which the stars were becoming
visible.</p>
<p>"I was going to be a hero, once," said Professor Quirrell, still
looking upward. "Can you believe that, Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Thank you again, Miss Granger. It is true nonetheless. Long
ago, long before your time or Harry Potter's, there was a man who
was hailed as a savior. The destined scion, such a one as anyone
would recognize from tales, wielding justice and vengeance like
twin wands against his dreadful nemesis." Professor Quirrell gave a
soft, bitter laugh, looking up at the night sky. "Do you know, Miss
Granger, at that time I thought myself already cynical, and yet...
well."</p>
<p>The silence stretched, in the cold and the night.</p>
<p>"In all honesty," said Professor Quirrell, looking up at the
stars, "I still don't understand it. They should have known that
their lives depended on that man's success. And yet it was as if
they tried to do everything they could to make his life
<i>unpleasant.</i> To throw every possible obstacle into his way. I
was not naive, Miss Granger, I did not expect the power-holders to
align themselves with me so quickly - not without something in it
for themselves. But their power, too, was threatened; and so I was
shocked how they seemed content to step back, and leave to that man
all burdens of responsibility. They sneered at his performance,
remarking among themselves how they would do better in his place,
though they did not condescend to step forward." Professor Quirrell
shook his head as though in bemusement. "And it was the strangest
thing - the Dark Wizard, that man's dread nemesis - why, those who
served <i>him</i> leapt eagerly to their tasks. The Dark Wizard
grew crueler toward his followers, and they followed him all the
more. Men fought for the chance to serve <i>him</i>, even as those
whose lives depended on that other man made free to render his life
difficult... I could not understand it, Miss Granger." Professor
Quirrell's face was in shadow, as he looked upward. "Perhaps, by
taking on himself the curse of action, that man removed it from all
others? Was that why they felt free to hinder his battle against
the Dark Wizard who would have enslaved them all? Believing men
would act in their own interest was not cynicism, it turned out,
but sheerest optimism; in reality men do not meet so high a
standard. And so in time that one realized he might do better
fighting the Dark Wizard alone, than with such followers at his
back."</p>
<p>"So -" Hermione's voice sounded strange in the night. "You left
your friends behind where they'd be safe, and tried to attack the
Dark Wizard all by yourself?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Professor Quirrell. "I stopped trying to be a
hero, and went off to do something else I found more pleasant."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Hermione without thinking at all. "That's
<i>horrible!</i>"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor turned his head down from the sky to
regard her; and she saw, in the light of the doorway, that he was
smiling - or at least half his face was smiling. "Are you going to
tell me, Miss Granger, that I am an awful person? Well, perhaps I
am. But then are people who never even try to be heroes still
worse? If I had never done anything at all, like them, would you
have thought better of me?"</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth and then found that, once again, she
didn't have anything to say. It wasn't right to walk away from
being a hero, you couldn't just <i>do</i> that, but she didn't
<i>want</i> to say that everyone who wasn't a hero was nothing,
that was Quirrell-thinking...</p>
<p>The smile, or half-smile, had disappeared. "You were foolish,"
the Defense Professor said quietly, "to expect any lasting
gratitude from those you tried to protect, once you named yourself
a heroine. Just as you expected that man to go on being a hero, and
called him horrible for stopping, when a thousand others never
lifted a finger. It was only <i>expected</i> that you should fight
bullies. It was a tax you owed, and they accepted it like princes,
with a sneer for the lateness of your payment. And you have already
witnessed, I wager, that their fondness vanished like dust in the
wind once it was no longer in their interest to associate with
you..."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor slowly straightened off the balcony,
standing almost straight, turning to regard her fully.</p>
<p>"But you don't have to be a hero, Miss Granger," said Professor
Quirrell. "You can stop anytime you please."</p>
<p>That idea...</p>
<p>...<i>had</i> occurred to her before, several times over the
last two days.</p>
<p><i>People become who they are meant to be, by doing what is
right,</i> Headmaster Dumbledore had told her. The trouble was that
there seemed to be two different right things to do. There was the
part of her which said that <i>right</i> was to go on being a
heroine, and stay at Hogwarts, she didn't know what was going on
but a heroine wouldn't just run away.</p>
<p>And there was also the voice of common sense saying that young
children shouldn't ever stay around danger, that was what adults
were for; the voice of every school poster that said not to take
candy from strangers. That was also right.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger stood there on that balcony, looking at
Professor Quirrell silhouetted by the emerging stars, and she
didn't understand; she didn't understand how the Defense Professor
could be gazing at her with his face showing concern; she didn't
understand the notes of pain in the Defense Professor's voice that
caught at her; she didn't understand <i>why</i> she was being told
all this.</p>
<p>"You don't even like me, Professor," said Hermione.</p>
<p>A small smile flickered on Professor Quirrell's face. "I suppose
I could go on about how I am angered that this affair has taken up
my valuable time and disrupted my Defense classes. But mostly, Miss
Granger, you are my student, and whatever other professions I may
have once held, I think I have been a good teacher at Hogwarts,
have I not?" Suddenly Professor Quirrell's eyes seemed very tired.
"As your teacher, then, I am advising you that you have other
career options. I should not like to see anyone else going down my
path."</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed. It was a side of Professor Quirrell she'd
never seen or imagined, and it was eating away at her
preconceptions.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell watched her for a moment, and then looked
away from her again, back up at the stars. When he spoke this time
his voice was quieter. "Someone here is targeting you, Miss
Granger, and I cannot ward you as I warded Mr. Malfoy. The
Headmaster has prevented it, for what he claims to be good reasons.
It is easy to become fond of Hogwarts, I know, for I am fond of it
as well. But in France they take a different view of the Ancient
Houses than in Britain; and Beauxbatons would not mistreat you, I
think. Whatever else you imagine of me, I swear that if you asked
me to see you safely in Beauxbatons, I would do all in my power to
convey you there."</p>
<p>"I can't just -" Hermione said.</p>
<p>"But you <i>can,</i> Miss Granger." Now the pale blue eyes
watched her intently. "Whatever you wish to make of your life, you
cannot attain it at Hogwarts, not anymore. This place is ruined for
you now, even leaving aside all other threats. Simply ask Harry
Potter to command you to go to Beauxbatons and live out your life
in peace. If you stay here, he is your master in the eyes of
Britain and its laws!"</p>
<p>She hadn't even been thinking about that, it paled so much in
comparison to being eaten by Dementors; it had been important to
her before, but now it all seemed childish, unimportant, pointless,
so why were her eyes burning?</p>
<p>"And if that fails to move you, Miss Granger, consider also that
Mr. Potter has, just today at lunchtime, threatened Lucius Malfoy,
Albus Dumbledore, and the entire Wizengamot because he cannot think
sensibly when something threatens to take you from him. Are you not
frightened of what he will do next?"</p>
<p>It made sense. Terrible sense. Dreadful awful sense.</p>
<p>It made <i>too much</i> sense -</p>
<p>She couldn't have described it in words, what triggered the
realization, unless it was the sheer <i>pressure</i> that the
Defense Professor was exerting on her.</p>
<p>That if the Defense Professor <i>was</i> behind this whole thing
- then Professor Quirrell had done it all <i>just to get her out of
the way of his plans for Harry.</i></p>
<p>Without any conscious decision, she shifted her weight to the
other foot, her body moving away from the Defense Professor -</p>
<p>"So you think I am the one responsible?" said Professor
Quirrell. His voice sounded a little sad as he said it, and her own
heart almost stopped from hearing it. "I suppose I cannot blame
you. I am the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, after all. But Miss
Granger, even <i>assuming</i> that I am your enemy, common sense
should still tell you to get away from me <i>very quickly</i>. You
cannot use the Killing Curse, so the correct tactic is to Apparate
away. I do not mind being the villain of your imagination if it
makes matters clearer. Leave Hogwarts, and leave me to those who
can handle me. I will arrange for the transportation to be through
some family of good repute, and Mr. Potter will know to blame me if
you do not arrive safely."</p>
<p>"I -" She was feeling cold, the night air chilling her skin, or
maybe being chilled by it. "I've got to think about it -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. "No, Miss Granger. Your
departure will take time for me to arrange, and I have less time
left than you may think. This decision may be painful for you, but
it should not be ambiguous; much weighs in the balance of these
scales, but not evenly. I must know tonight whether you intend to
go."</p>
<p><i>And if not -</i></p>
<p>Was the Defense Professor warning her deliberately? That if she
didn't run, he would strike again?</p>
<p>Why would it matter so much, what did Professor Quirrell want to
<i>do</i> with Harry?</p>
<p><i>Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a
mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot</i>
<i>imagine</i> <i>how badly things could go if the events
surrounding Harry Potter turn to ill.</i></p>
<p>The most powerful wizard in the world had told her that, when he
was talking about how important it was that she <i>not</i> stop
being Harry's friend.</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed, she swayed a little where she stood, on the
stone balcony of a magical castle. Suddenly the whole deadly
absurdity of the situation seemed to rise up and grab her by the
throat, that twelve-year-old girls <i>shouldn't</i> be in danger,
<i>shouldn't</i> be thinking about such things, that Mum would want
her to RUN AWAY and her father would have a heart attack if he even
knew she was being faced with the question.</p>
<p>And she knew, then, as Harry and Dumbledore had both tried to
warn her, that everything she'd ever thought about being a heroine
had been mistaken. That there wasn't really any such thing as
heroes, outside of stories. There was just horrible danger, and
being arrested by Aurors and put in cells next to Dementors, pain
and fear and -</p>
<p>"Miss Granger?" said the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>She said nothing. All the words were blocked in her throat.</p>
<p>"I need a decision, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>She kept her jaw locked, didn't let any words come out.</p>
<p>Finally the Defense Professor sighed. Slowly the white light
failed, and slowly the door behind him swung open, so that he was
once again a black silhouette against the opening. "Good night,
Miss Granger," he said, and turned his back to her, and walked away
into Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It took a while for her breathing to slow down again. Whatever
had happened here tonight, it didn't feel anything like victory.
She'd fought so hard just to stop herself from saying <i>Yes</i> in
the face of the Defense Professor's pressure, and now she didn't
even know if she'd done the right thing.</p>
<p>When she walked back into the light herself (after exhaustion
had overtaken everything and sleep was once more a possibility),
she thought she heard it as she was within the doorway, from behind
her and above her, a distant cawing cry.</p>
<p>But it wasn't meant for her, she knew, so she started climbing
up the stairs toward her dorm room.</p>
<p>The other girls were probably asleep by now, and wouldn't look
at her, or look away -</p>
<p>She felt the tears start, and this time she didn't stop
them.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="85">Chapter 85</h2><h3>Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 3,
Distance</h3>
<p><i>This chapter received a major, significiant revision on
December 16th, 2012. The main revision starts about halfway through
- search on the word "trivial" to find it.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Slow and hard, the long stairway that led to the peak of
Ravenclaw. From the inside, the stairway seemed like a straight
upward slope, though from the outside you could see that it
logically had to be a spiral. You could only get to the top of the
Ravenclaw tower by making that long climb without shortcuts, stone
step by stone step; passing beneath Harry's shoes, pushed down by
his wearying legs.</p>
<p>Harry had seen Hermione safely off to bed.</p>
<p>He had lingered in the Ravenclaw common room long enough to
collect a few signatures that might be useful to Hermione later.
Not many students had signed; wizards hadn't been trained to think
in the put-up-or-shut-up,
stick-your-neck-out-and-make-a-prediction-or-stop-pretending-to-believe-in-your-theory
rules of Muggle science. Most of them hadn't seen anything
<i>incongruent</i> about being too nervous to sign an agreement
saying that Hermione got to hold it over them for the rest of their
lives if they were wrong, while acting outwardly confident that she
was guilty. But just having demanded the signatures would make the
point after the truth came out, if anyone ever again suspected
Hermione of anything Dark. She wouldn't have to go through this
<i>twice,</i> at least.</p>
<p>After that Harry had left the common room quickly, because all
the kindly forgiving sentiments he'd reasoned out were getting
harder and harder to remember. Sometimes Harry thought the deepest
split in his personality wasn't anything to do with his dark side;
rather it was the divide between the altruistic and forgiving
Abstract Reasoning Harry, versus the frustrated and angry Harry In
The Moment.</p>
<p>The circular platform at the top of the Ravenclaw tower wasn't
the tallest place in Hogwarts, but the Ravenclaw tower jutted out
from the main body of the castle, so you couldn't see down into the
top platform from the Astronomy tower. A quiet place to think, if
you had an awful lot to think about. A place where few other
students ever came - there were easier niches of privacy, if
privacy was all you wanted.</p>
<p>The night-lit torches of Hogwarts were far below. The platform
itself offered few obstructions; the stairs emerged from an
uncovered gap in the floor, rather than an upright door. From this
place, then, the stars were as visible as they ever were on
Earth.</p>
<p>The boy lay down in the center of the platform, heedless of his
robes that might be dirtied, dropping his head to rest upon the
rock-tiled floor; so that, except for a few half-seen crenellations
of stone at vision's edge, and a sliver of crescent moon, reality
became starlight.</p>
<p>The pinpoints of light in dark velvet twinkled, wavering and
returning, a different kind of beauty from their steady brilliance
in the Silent Night.</p>
<p>Harry gazed out abstractly, his mind on other things.</p>
<p><i>This day your war against Voldemort has begun...</i></p>
<p>Dumbledore had said that, after the Incident with Rescuing
Bellatrix from Azkaban. That had been a false alarm, but the phrase
expressed the sentiment well.</p>
<p>Two nights ago his war had begun, and Harry didn't know with
<i>who</i>.</p>
<p>Dumbledore thought it was Lord Voldemort, returned from the
dead, making his first move against the boy who had defeated him
last time.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had put detection wards on Draco, fearing
that Hogwarts's mad Headmaster would try to frame Harry for the
death of Lucius's son.</p>
<p>Or Professor Quirrell had set up the entire thing, and
<i>that</i> was how he'd known where to find Draco. Severus Snape
thought the Hogwarts Defense Professor was an obvious suspect, even
<i>the</i> obvious suspect.</p>
<p>And Severus Snape himself might or might not be even remotely
trustworthy.</p>
<p><i>Someone</i> had declared war against Harry, their first
strike had been meant to take out Draco and Hermione both, and it
was only by the barest of margins that Harry had saved
Hermione.</p>
<p>You couldn't call it victory. Draco had been removed from
Hogwarts, and if that wasn't death, it wasn't clear how it could be
undone, or what shape Draco might be in when he got back. The
country of magical Britain now thought Hermione an
attempted-murderer, which might or might not make her decide to do
the sane thing and leave. Harry had sacrificed his entire fortune
to undo his loss, and that card could only be played once.</p>
<p>Some unknown power had struck at him, and if that blow had been
partially deflected, it had still hit <i>really hard.</i></p>
<p>At least his dark side hadn't asked anything of him in exchange
for saving Hermione. Maybe because his dark side <i>wasn't</i> an
imaginary voice like Hufflepuff; Harry might <i>imagine</i> his
Hufflepuff part as wanting different things from himself, but his
dark side wasn't like that. His "dark side", so far as Harry could
tell, was a different way that Harry sometimes <i>was</i>. Right
now, Harry wasn't angry; and trying to ask what "dark Harry" wanted
was a phone ringing unanswered. The thought even seemed a little
strange; could you owe something to a different way you sometimes
were?</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the random stars, the scattered twinkling
lights that human brains couldn't help but pattern-match into
imaginary constellations.</p>
<p>And then there was that promise Harry had sworn.</p>
<p>Draco to help Harry reform Slytherin House. And Harry to take as
an enemy whomever Harry believed, in his best judgment as a
rationalist, to have killed Narcissa Malfoy. If Narcissa had never
gotten her own hands dirty, if indeed she'd been burned alive, if
the killer hadn't been tricked - those were all the conditions
Harry could remember making. He probably should've written it down,
or better yet, never made a promise requiring that many caveats in
the first place.</p>
<p>There were plausible outs, for the sort of person who'd let
themselves rationalize an out. Dumbledore hadn't <i>actually</i>
confessed. He hadn't come right out and said he'd done it. There
were plausible reasons for an actually-guilty Dumbledore to behave
that way. But it was <i>also</i> what you'd expect to see, if
someone else had burned Narcissa, and Dumbledore had taken
credit.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, flattening one side of his hair and then
another against the stone-tiled floor. There was still a final out,
Draco could still release him from the oath at any time. He could,
at least, describe the situation to Draco, and talk about options
with him, when they met again. It didn't seem like a very likely
prospect for release - but the idea of talking something over
honestly was enough to satisfy the part of himself that demanded
adherence to oaths. Even if it only meant delaying, it was better
than taking a good man as an enemy.</p>
<p><i>But</i> is <i>Dumbledore a good man?</i> asked the voice of
Hufflepuff. <i>If Dumbledore burned someone alive - wasn't the
whole point that good people may kill, but never kill with
suffering?</i></p>
<p><i>Maybe he killed her instantly,</i> said Slytherin, <i>and
then lied to Lucius about the burning-alive part. But... if there
was</i> any <i>possibility of the Death Eaters magically verifying
how Narcissa died... and if being caught in a lie would've
endangered Light-side families...</i></p>
<p><i>Be careful what we cleverly rationalize,</i> warned
Gryffindor.</p>
<p><i>You have to expect reputational effects on how other people
treat you,</i> said Hufflepuff. <i>If you decide there's sufficient
reason to burn a woman alive, one of the predictable side effects
is that good people decide you've crossed the line and have to be
stopped. Dumbledore should've expected that. He's got no right to
complain.</i></p>
<p><i>Or maybe he expects us to be smarter,</i> said Slytherin.
<i>Now that we know this much of the truth - no matter the exact
details of the full story - can we really believe that Dumbledore
is a terrible, terrible person who ought to be our enemy? In the
middle of a horrible bloody war, Dumbledore set</i> one <i>enemy
civilian on fire? That's only bad by the standards of comic books,
not by any sort of realistic historical standard.</i></p>
<p>Harry stared up at the night sky, remembering history.</p>
<p>In real life, in real wars...</p>
<p>During World War II, there had been a project to sabotage the
Nazi nuclear weapons program. Years earlier, Leo Szilard, the first
person to realize the possibility of a fission chain reaction, had
convinced Fermi not to publish the discovery that purified graphite
was a cheap and effective neutron moderator. Fermi had wanted to
publish, for the sake of the great international project of
science, which was above nationalism. But Szilard had persuaded
Rabi, and Fermi had abided by the majority vote of their tiny
three-person conspiracy. And so, years later, the only neutron
moderator the Nazis had known about was deuterium.</p>
<p>The only deuterium source under Nazi control had been a captured
facility in occupied Norway, which had been knocked out by bombs
and sabotage, causing a total of twenty-four civilian deaths.</p>
<p>The Nazis had tried to ship the deuterium already refined to
Germany, aboard a civilian Norwegian ferry, the <i>SS
Hydro.</i></p>
<p>Knut Haukelid and his assistants had been discovered by the
night watchman of the civilian ferry while they were sneaking on
board to sabotage it. Haukelid had told the watchman that they were
escaping the Gestapo, and the watchman had let them go. Haukelid
had considered warning the night watchman, but that would have
endangered the mission, so Haukelid had only shaken his hand. And
the civilian ship had sunk in the deepest part of the lake, with
eight dead Germans, seven dead crew, and three dead civilian
bystanders. Some of the Norwegian rescuers of the ship had thought
the German soldiers present should be left to drown, but this view
had not prevailed, and the German survivors had been rescued. And
that had been the end of the Nazi nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Which was to say that Knut Haukelid had killed innocent people.
One of whom, the night watchman of the ship, had been a <i>good</i>
person. Someone who'd gone out of his way to help Haukelid, at risk
to himself; from the kindness of his heart, for the highest moral
reasons; and been sent to drown in turn. Afterward, in the cold
light of history, it had looked like the Nazis had never been close
to getting nuclear weapons after all.</p>
<p>And Harry had never read anything suggesting that Haukelid had
acted wrongly.</p>
<p>That was war in real life. In terms of total damage and who'd
gotten hit, what Haukelid had done was considerably <i>worse</i>
than what Dumbledore might have done to Narcissa Malfoy, or what
Dumbledore had possibly done to leak the prophecy to Lord Voldemort
to get him to attack Harry's parents.</p>
<p>If Haukelid had been a comic-book superhero, he'd have somehow
gotten all the civilians off the ferry, he would've attacked the
German soldiers directly...</p>
<p>...rather than let a single innocent person die...</p>
<p>...but Knut Haukelid hadn't been a superhero.</p>
<p>And neither had been Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes, swallowing hard a few times against the
sudden choking sensation. It was abruptly very clear that while
Harry was going around trying to live the ideals of the
Enlightenment, Dumbledore was the one who'd actually <i>fought in a
war</i>. Nonviolent ideals were cheap to hold if you were a
scientist, living inside the <i>Protego</i> bubble cast by the
police officers and soldiers whose actions you had the luxury to
question. Albus Dumbledore seemed to have started out with ideals
at least as strong as Harry's own, if not stronger; and Dumbledore
hadn't gotten through his war without killing enemies and
sacrificing friends.</p>
<p><i>Are you so much better than Haukelid and Dumbledore, Harry
Potter, that you'll be able to fight without a single casualty?
Even in the world of comic books, the only reason a superhero like
Batman even</i> looks <i>successful is that the comic-book readers
only notice when Important Named Characters die, not when the Joker
shoots some random nameless bystander to show off his villainy.
Batman is a murderer no less than the Joker, for all the lives the
Joker took that Batman could've saved by killing him. That's what
the man named Alastor was trying to tell Dumbledore, and afterward
Dumbledore regretted having taken so long to change his mind. Are
you really going to try to follow the path of the superhero, and
never sacrifice a single piece or kill a single enemy?</i></p>
<p>Fatigued, Harry turned his attention away from the dilemma for a
moment, opened his eyes again to regard the hemisphere of night,
which required no decisions from him.</p>
<p>Near the edge of his vision, the pale white crescent of the
Moon, the light from which had left one-and-a-quarter seconds ago,
around 375,000 kilometers of distance in Earth's space of
simultaneity.</p>
<p>Above and to the side, Polaris, the North Star; the first star
Harry had learned to identify in the sky, by following the edge of
the Big Dipper. That was actually a five-star system with a
brilliant central supergiant, 434 light-years from Earth. It was
the first 'star' whose name Harry had ever learned from his father,
so long ago that he couldn't have guessed how old he'd been.</p>
<p>The dim fog that was the Milky Way, so many billions of distant
stars that they became an indistinct river, the plane of a galaxy
that stretched 100,000 light-years across. If Harry had experienced
any sense of wonder when he'd <i>first</i> been told that, he'd
been too young for him to remember now that first time, across a
few years' distance.</p>
<p>In the center of the constellation Andromeda, the star
Andromeda, which was really the Andromeda Galaxy. The nearest
galaxy to the Milky Way, 2.4 million light-years away, containing
an estimated trillion stars.</p>
<p>Numbers like those made 'infinity' pale by comparison, because
'infinity' was just featureless and blank. Thinking that the stars
were 'infinitely' distant was a lot less scary than trying to work
out what 2.4 million light-years amounted to in meters. 2.4 million
light-years, times 31 million seconds in a year, times a photon
moving at 300,000,000 meters per second...</p>
<p>It was strange to think that such distances might <i>not</i> be
unreachably far away. Magic was loose in the universe, things like
Time-Turners and broomsticks. Had any wizard ever tried to measure
the speed of a portkey, or a phoenix?</p>
<p>And the human understanding of magic couldn't possibly be
anywhere <i>near</i> the underlying laws. What would you be able to
do with magic if you <i>really</i> understood it?</p>
<p>A year ago, Dad had gone to the Australian National University
in Canberra for a conference where he'd been an invited speaker,
and he'd taken Mum and Harry along. And they'd all visited the
National Museum of Australia, because, it had turned out, there was
basically nothing else to do in Canberra. The glass display cases
had shown rock-throwers crafted by the Australian aborigines - like
giant wooden shoehorns, they'd looked, but smoothed and carved and
ornamented with painstaking care. In the 40,000 years since
anatomically modern humans had migrated to Australia from Asia,
nobody had invented the bow-and-arrow. It really made you
appreciate how <i>non-obvious</i> was the idea of Progress. Why
would you even think of Invention as something important, if all
your history's heroic tales were of great warriors and defenders
instead of Thomas Edison? How could anyone have suspected, while
carving a rock-thrower with painstaking care, that someday human
beings would invent rocket ships and nuclear energy?</p>
<p>Could you have looked up into the sky, at the brilliant light of
the Sun, and deduced that the universe contained greater sources of
power than mere fire? Would you have realized that if the
fundamental physical laws permitted it, someday humans would tap
the same energies as the Sun? Even if nothing you could imagine
doing with rock-throwers or woven pouches - no pattern of running
across the savannah and nothing you could obtain by hunting animals
- would accomplish that even in imagination?</p>
<p>It wasn't like modern-day Muggles had gotten anywhere near the
limits of what Muggle physics said was possible. And yet like
hunter-gatherers conceptually bound to their rock-throwers, most
Muggles lived in a world defined by the limits of what you could do
with cars and telephones. Even though Muggle physics explicitly
permitted possibilities like molecular nanotechnology or the
Penrose process for extracting energy from black holes, most people
filed that away in the same section of their brain that stored
fairy tales and history books, well away from their personal
realities: <i>Long ago and far away, ever so long ago.</i> No
surprise, then, that the wizarding world lived in a conceptual
universe bounded - not by fundamental laws of magic that nobody
even knew - but just by the surface rules of known Charms and
enchantments. You couldn't observe the way magic was practiced
nowadays and <i>not</i> be reminded of the National Museum of
Australia, once you realized what you were seeing. Even if Harry's
first guess had been mistaken, one way or another it was still
inconceivable that the <i>fundamental</i> laws of the universe
contained a special case for human lips shaping the phrase
'Wingardium Leviosa'. And yet even that fumbling grasp of magic was
enough to do things that Muggle physics said should be <i>forever
impossible:</i> the Time-Turner, water conjured out of nothingness
by <i>Aguamenti.</i> What were the <i>ultimate</i> possibilities of
invention, if the underlying laws of the universe permitted an
eleven-year-old with a stick to violate almost every constraint in
the Muggle version of physics?</p>
<p>Like a hunter-gatherer trying to look up at the Sun, and guess
that the universe had to be shaped in a way that allowed for
nuclear energy...</p>
<p>It made you wonder if maybe twenty thousand million million
million meters wasn't so much distance, after all.</p>
<p>There was a step beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry which he could
take, given time enough to compose himself and the right
surroundings; something beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry, as that
was beyond Harry In The Moment. Looking up at the stars, you could
try to imagine what the distant descendants of humanity would think
of your dilemma - in a hundred million years, when the stars would
have spun through great galactic movements into entirely new
positions, every constellation scattered. It was an elementary
theorem of probability that if you knew what your answer would be
after updating on future evidence, you ought to adopt that answer
right now. If you <i>knew</i> your destination, you were already
there. And by analogy, if not quite by theorem, if you could guess
what the descendants of humanity would think of something, you
ought to go ahead and take that as your own best guess.</p>
<p>From that vantage point the idea of killing off two-thirds of
the Wizengamot seemed a lot less appealing than it had a few hours
earlier. Even if you <i>had</i> to do it, even if you knew for a
solid fact that it would be the best thing for magical Britain and
that the complete Story of Time would look worse if you didn't do
it... even as a necessity, the deaths of sentient beings would
still be a tragedy. One more element of the sorrows of Earth; the
Most Ancient Earth from which everything had begun, long ago and
far away, ever so long ago.</p>
<p><i>He is not like Grindelwald</i>. <i>There is nothing human
left in him. Him you must destroy. Save your fury for that, and
that alone -</i></p>
<p>Harry shook his head slightly, tilting the stars a little in his
vision, as he lay on the stone floor looking upward and outward and
forward in time. Even if Dumbledore was right, and the true enemy
was utterly mad and evil... in a hundred million years the organic
lifeform known as Lord Voldemort probably wouldn't seem much
different from all the other bewildered children of Ancient Earth.
Whatever Lord Voldemort had done to himself, whatever Dark rituals
seemed so horribly irrevocable on a merely human scale, it wouldn't
be beyond curing with the technology of a hundred million years.
Killing him, even if you <i>had</i> to do it to save the lives of
others, would be just one more death for future sentient beings to
be sad about. How could you look up at the stars, and believe
anything else?</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the twinkling lights of Eternity and wondered
what the children's children's children would think of what
Dumbledore had maybe-done to Narcissa.</p>
<p>But even if you tried framing the question that way, asking what
humanity's descendants would think, it still drew only on your own
knowledge, not theirs. The answer still came from inside yourself,
and it could still be mistaken. If you didn't know the hundredth
decimal digit of pi yourself, then you didn't know how the
children's children's children would calculate it, for all that the
fact was trivial.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Slowly - he'd been lying there, looking at the stars, for longer
than he'd planned - Harry sat up from the ground. Pushing himself
to his feet, the muscles protesting, he walked over to the edge of
the stone platform at the height of the Ravenclaw tower. The stone
crenellations surrounding the edge of the tower weren't high, not
high enough to be safe. They were markers, clearly, rather than
railings. Harry didn't approach too close to the edge; there was no
point in taking chances. Looking down at the Hogwarts grounds
below, he was predictably feeling a sense of dizziness, the wobbly
affliction called vertigo. His brain was alarmed, it seemed,
because the ground below was so <i>distant</i>. It might have been
fully 50 meters away.</p>
<p>The lesson, it seemed, was that things had to be
<i>incredibly</i> close by before your brain could comprehend them
well enough to feel fear.</p>
<p>It was a rare brain that could feel strongly about anything, if
it wasn't close in space, close in time, near at hand, within easy
reach...</p>
<p>Before, Harry had imagined that going to Azkaban would require
planning and cooperation from a grownup confederate. Portkeys,
broomsticks, invisibility spells. Some way of getting to the bottom
levels without the Aurors noticing, so he could carve his way into
the central pit where the shadows of Death waited.</p>
<p>And that had been enough to put the prospect away, into the
future, safely apart from the <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>He hadn't realized until today that it might be as simple as
finding Fawkes and telling the phoenix that it was time.</p>
<p>Memories were rising up again, memories that Harry could never
manage to forget for long. Though the stones beneath his feet were
not smooth like metal, though the moonlit sky stretched all around
him, somehow it was very easy to imagine himself trapped in a long
metal corridor lit by dim orange light.</p>
<p>The night was quiet, quiet enough for memories to be clearly
audible.</p>
<p><i>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!</i></p>
<p><i>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!</i></p>
<p><i>Don't take it away, don't don't don't -</i></p>
<p>The world blurred, and Harry wiped his eyes with his sleeve.</p>
<p>If <i>Hermione</i> had been the one behind that door -</p>
<p>If Hermione had been put in Azkaban, Harry would have called the
phoenix and gone there and burned away every last Dementor and it
wouldn't have made a single difference how crazy it was or what
else he'd wanted to do with his life. That was just - that was -
that was just how it was.</p>
<p>And the woman who <i>was</i> behind that door - wasn't there
someone, somewhere, to whom she too was precious? Wasn't it only
Harry's distance from her life that was preventing his brain from
being driven to Azkaban to <i>save her no matter what?</i> What
would it have taken to compel him? Would he have needed to know her
face? Her name? Her favorite color? Would he have been driven to
Azkaban to save Tracey Davis? Would he have been compelled there to
save Professor McGonagall? Mum and Dad - there wasn't even any
question. And that woman had said she was someone's mother. How
many people had wished for the power to break Azkaban? How many
prisoners of Azkaban dreamed nightly of such a miraculous
rescue?</p>
<p><i>None. It's a happy thought.</i></p>
<p>Maybe he <i>should</i> harrow Azkaban. All he had to do was find
Fawkes and tell him it was time. Visualize the center of the
Dementor's pit as he'd seen it from the broomstick, and let the
phoenix take him there. Cast the True Patronus Charm at point-blank
range and to hell with what came after.</p>
<p>All he had to do was go find Fawkes.</p>
<p>It might be as simple as thinking of the flame, calling for the
fire-bird in his heart -</p>
<p>A star flashed in the night.</p>
<p>By the time Harry's eyes had jumped with a reflex action trained
on meteor showers, another part of him was surprised that the
astronomical phenomenon was still there; a faint star whose
brightness was slowly visibly waxing. There was a startled moment
when Harry wondered whether he was seeing, not a meteor, but a nova
or supernova - could you <i>see</i> them getting brighter like
that? Was the first stage of a nova supposed to be that
yellow-orange color?</p>
<p>Then the new star moved again, and seemed to grow as well as
brightening. It looked <i>closer</i> suddenly, no longer so far
away that distance became moot. Like what you thought was a star,
turning out to be an airplane, a lighted form whose shape you could
actually see...</p>
<p>...no, not a plane...</p>
<p>The realization seemed to spread out from Harry's chest in a
wave of prickling, sweat preparing to break out.</p>
<p>...a bird.</p>
<p>A piercing cry split the night, echoing from the rooftops of
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>The approaching creature trailed fire as it flew, shedding
golden flames like sparks from its feathers as the mighty wings
beat and beat again. Even as it swooped up in a great curve to
hover a few paces away from Harry, even as the flames surrounding
its passage diminished, the creature seemed no dimmer, no less
bright; as though some unseen Sun shone upon it and illuminated
it.</p>
<p>Great shining wings red like a sunset, and eyes like
incandescent pearls, blazing with golden fire and
determination.</p>
<p>The phoenix's beak opened, and let out a great caw that Harry
understood as though it had been a spoken word:</p>
<p><i>COME!</i></p>
<p>Not even realizing, the boy stumbled back from the edge of the
rooftop, eyes still locked on the phoenix, his whole body trembling
and tensed, his fists clutching and releasing at his side; stepping
back, stepping away.</p>
<p>The phoenix cawed again, a desperate, pleading, sound. It didn't
come through in words, this time, but it came through in feelings,
an echo of everything that Harry had ever felt about Azkaban and
every temptation to <i>action,</i> to just <i>do</i> something
about it, the desperate need to do something <i>now</i> and not
delay any longer, all spoken in the cry of a bird.</p>
<p><i>Let's go. It's time.</i> The voice that spoke came from
inside Harry, not from the phoenix; from so deep inside it couldn't
be given a separate name like 'Gryffindor'.</p>
<p>All he had to do was step forward and touch the phoenix's
talons, and it would take him where he needed to be, where he kept
thinking he ought to be, down into the central pit of Azkaban.
Harry could see the image in his mind, shining with unbearably
clarity, the image of himself suddenly smiling with joyous release
as he threw all his fears away and <i>chose</i> -</p>
<p>"But I -" Harry whispered, not even aware of what he was saying.
Harry lifted his shaking hands to wipe at his eyes from which tears
had sprung, as the phoenix hovered before him with great
wing-sweeps. "But I - there's other people I also have to save,
other things I have to do -"</p>
<p>The fire-bird let out a piercing scream, and the boy flinched
back as though from a blow. It wasn't a command, it wasn't an
objection, it was the <i>knowledge -</i></p>
<p>The corridors lit by dim orange light.</p>
<p>It felt like a tightening compulsion in Harry's chest, the
desire to just <i>do</i> it and get it over with. He might die, but
if he didn't die he could feel <i>clean</i> again. Have principles
that were more than excuses for inaction. It was <i>his</i> life.
His to spend, if he chose. He could do it any time he wanted...</p>
<p>...if he wasn't a good person.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The boy stood there on the rooftop, his own eyes locked with two
points of fire. The stars might have had time to shift in their
constellations while he stood there, agonizing over the
decision...</p>
<p>...that wouldn't...</p>
<p>...change.</p>
<p>The boy's eyes flickered once to the stars above; and then he
looked at the phoenix.</p>
<p>"Not yet," the boy said in a voice hardly audible. "Not yet.
There's too much else I have to do. Please come back later, when
I've found others who can cast the True Patronus - in six months,
maybe -"</p>
<p>Without word, without sound, a sphere of fire surrounded the
bird's form, crackling and blazing with white and crimson veins as
though it meant to consume that which lay within; and when the fire
dispersed into grey smoke, no phoenix remained.</p>
<p>There was silence on the top of the Ravenclaw tower. The boy
gradually lowered his hands from his ears, pausing only to wipe at
his wet cheeks.</p>
<p>Slowly, the boy turned -</p>
<p>Then cried out and leapt back and almost fell off the Ravenclaw
tower; though the misstep would hardly have mattered, with that
other wizard standing there.</p>
<p>"And so it was done," Albus Dumbledore said, almost in a
whisper. "So it was done." Fawkes was on his shoulder, staring at
where the other phoenix had been with an indecipherable avian
gaze.</p>
<p>"<i>What are you doing here?</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah?" said the ancient man standing on the roof-platform's
opposite corner. "I felt the presence of a creature Hogwarts did
not know, and came to see, of course." Slowly the old wizard's
shaking hand came up to remove the half-moon glasses, his other
hand wiped at his eyes and forehead with his robe's sleeve. "I
dared - I dared not speak - I knew, I knew this choice above all
choices must be your own -"</p>
<p>A strange apprehension was beginning to fill Harry, welling up
in him like a sick feeling in his stomach.</p>
<p>"That everything depended on this," Albus Dumbledore said, still
in that almost-whisper, "that much I knew. But which choice led
into darkness, that I could not guess. At least the choice was your
own."</p>
<p>"I don't -" Harry said, and then his voice stopped.</p>
<p>A terrible hypothesis, rising in credibility...</p>
<p>"The phoenix comes," said the old wizard. "To those who would
fight, to those would act even at cost of their lives, the phoenix
comes. Phoenixes are not wise, Harry, they know no means to judge
us, save witnessing the choice. I thought it was to my death I
went, when the phoenix took me to fight Grindelwald. I did not know
that Fawkes would sustain me, and heal me, and stay by my side -"
The old wizard's voice quavered, for a moment. "It is not spoken of
- you should realize, Harry, why it is never spoken of - if the one
knew, the phoenix could not judge. But to you, Harry, I may say it
now, for the phoenix comes only once."</p>
<p>The old wizard walked across the top of the Ravenclaw tower to
where a boy stood rooted in dawning horror, in dawning and utter
horror.</p>
<p><i>In my duel with Grindelwald I could not win, only fight him
for long hours until he collapsed in exhaustion; and I would have
died of it afterward, if not for Fawkes -</i></p>
<p>Harry didn't even know he was speaking, until the whisper had
escaped him -</p>
<p>"Then I <i>could</i> have -"</p>
<p>"Could you have?" said the ancient wizard, his voice sounding
far older than his normal tones. "Three times, now, a phoenix has
come for my student. One did send hers away, and the grief of it
broke her, I think. And the last was cousin to your young friend
Lavender Brown, and he -" The old wizard's voice cracked. "He did
not return, did poor John, and he saved none of those he meant to
save. It is said, among the few scholars of phoenix-lore, that not
one in four returns from their ordeal. And even if you did survive
- for the life you must lead, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres - the
choices you must make and the path you must walk - to always hear
the phoenix's cries - who is to say it would not have driven you
mad?" The old wizard raised his sleeve again, drawing it once more
across his face. "I had more joy of Fawkes's companionship, in the
days before I fought Voldemort."</p>
<p>The boy did not seem to be listening, all his eyes were on the
red-gold bird on the ancient wizard's shoulder. "Fawkes?" the boy
said in shaking voice. "Why won't you look at me, Fawkes?"</p>
<p>Fawkes craned his head to peer at the boy curiously, then turned
back and resumed gazing at his master.</p>
<p>"See?" said the old wizard. "He does not reject you. Fawkes may
not be interested in you in quite that way, now; and he knows -"
the wizard smiled wryly, "- that you are not exactly loyal to his
master. But one to whom the phoenix comes at all - cannot be one
whom a phoenix would dislike." The wizard's voice fell to a whisper
again. "There never was a bird seen on Godric Gryffindor's
shoulder. Though it is not written even in his secrets, I think he
must have sent his phoenix away, before he chose the red and gold
for his colors. Perhaps the guilt of it urged him to greater
lengths than he ever would have dared otherwise. Or it might have
taught him humility, and respect for human frailty, and failure..."
The wizard bowed his head. "I truly do not know if your choice was
wise. I truly do not know if it was the right thing, or the wrong
thing. If I knew, Harry, I would have spoken. But I -" Dumbledore's
voice broke, then. "I am nothing but a foolish young boy who has
become a foolish old man, and I have no wisdom."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't breathe, the nausea seeming to fill and overflow
his whole body, stomach locked solid. He was suddenly and terribly
certain that he had failed, in some final sense failed, failed this
very night -</p>
<p>The boy whirled and ran out to the curb of the Ravenclaw
rooftop. "Come back!" His voice cracked, rising to a shriek.
<i>"Come back!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Final Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>She came awake with a gasp of horror, she woke with an unvoiced
scream on her lips and no words came forth, she could not
understand what she had seen, <i>she could not understand what she
had seen</i> -</p>
<p>"What time is it?" she whispered.</p>
<p>Her golden jeweled alarm clock whispered back, "Around eleven at
night. Go back to sleep."</p>
<p>Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in
sweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself
up before she tried to go back to sleep and eventually
succeeded.</p>
<p>Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.</p>
<p>In the Forbidden Forest, a centaur woken by a nameless
apprehension ceased scanning the night sky, having found only
questions there and no answers; and with a folding of his many
legs, Firenze went back to sleep.</p>
<p>In the distant lands of magical Asia, an ancient witch named Fan
Tong, sleeping the tired days away, told her anxious
great-great-grandson that she was fine, it had only been a
nightmare, and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>In a land where Muggleborns received no letters of any kind, a
girl-child too young to have a name of her own was rocked in the
arms of her annoyed but loving mother until she stopped crying and
went back to sleep.</p>
<p>None of them slept well.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of
the Headmaster of Hogwarts, with its drawers within drawers within
drawers, wherein all the past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was
stored; legend had it that Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost
in that desk, and was, in fact, still there, and wouldn't be let
out again until she got her files organized. Minerva didn't
particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she
inherited that desk someday - if any of them survived.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and
composed.</p>
<p>Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes,
hovering ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused
him of pretending to be.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to
arrive.</p>
<p>And Harry...</p>
<p>A boy's small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as
though the energies running through him were too great to allow
ordinary seating. Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and
within it all, the jagged lightning-bolt of his never-healing scar.
He seemed grimmer, now; even compared to a single week earlier.</p>
<p>For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley
with Harry, what seemed like ages and ages ago. There'd been this
somber boy <i>inside</i> that Harry, somehow, even then. This
wasn't entirely her own fault, or Albus's fault. And yet there was
something almost unbearably sad about the contrast between the
young boy she'd first met, and what magical Britain had made of
him. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she'd
gathered; Harry's adoptive parents had said to her that he'd spoken
little and played less with Muggle children. It was painful to
think that Harry might have had only a few months of playing beside
the other children in Hogwarts, before the war's demands had
stripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry
showed to the children his own age, when he wasn't staring down the
Wizengamot. But she couldn't stop herself from imagining Harry
Potter's childhood as a heap of firewood, and herself and Albus
feeding the wooden branches, piece by piece, into the flames.</p>
<p>"Prophecies are strange things," said Albus Dumbledore. The old
wizard's eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness. "Vague,
unclear, meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers.
Prophecy is ever a burden, for there are no answers there, only
questions."</p>
<p>Harry Potter was sitting tensely. "Headmaster Dumbledore," said
the boy with soft precision, "my friends are being targeted.
Hermione Granger almost went to Azkaban. The war has begun, as you
put it. Professor Trelawney's prophecy is key information for
weighing up the balance of my hypotheses about what's going on. Not
to mention how silly it is - and <i>dangerous</i> - that the Dark
Lord knows the prophecy and <i>I don't</i>."</p>
<p>Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in
reply; in whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that
Trelawney had made the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it,
he hadn't learned that much from her.</p>
<p>"Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his
defeat at your hands," the old wizard said then. "His knowledge
brought him only harm. Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also has
a literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted
prophecies. I'll interpret with caution, rest assured. But I've
already guessed quite a bit. Is it safer for me to work from
partial guesses?"</p>
<p>Time passed.</p>
<p>"Minerva," said Albus. "If you would."</p>
<p>"The one..." she began. The words came falteringly to her
throat; she was no actress. She couldn't imitate the deep, chilling
tone of the original prophecy; and yet somehow that tone seemed to
carry all the <i>meaning.</i> "The one with the power to vanquish
the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied
him, born as the seventh month dies..."</p>
<p>"<i>And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,</i>" came
Severus's voice, making her jump within her chair. The Potions
Master loomed tall by the fireplace. "<i>But he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not... and either must destroy all but a
remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist
in the same world.</i>"</p>
<p>That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it
chilled her bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill
Trelawney.</p>
<p>Harry was listening with a frown. "Can you repeat that?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches,
born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month
-</i>"</p>
<p>"Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyze
this <i>carefully</i> -"</p>
<p>This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the
parchment hawklike, as though to make sure that no unseen hand
reached in and snatched the precious information away.</p>
<p>"Let's see..." Harry said. "I'm male and born on July 31st,
check. I did in fact vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous
pronoun in line two... but I wasn't born yet so it's hard to see
how my parents could have thrice defied <i>me.</i> This scar is an
obvious candidate for the mark..." Harry touched his forehead.
"Then there's the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably
refers to my scientific background -"</p>
<p>"No," said Severus.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.</p>
<p>Severus's eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration.
"The Dark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books
as you, Potter. But the prophecy did not say, <i>power the Dark
Lord has not.</i> Nor even, <i>power the Dark Lord cannot have.</i>
She spoke of <i>power the Dark Lord knows not</i>... it will be
something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts. Something perhaps
that he cannot comprehend at all, even having seen it..."</p>
<p>"Science is not a bag of technological tricks," Harry said.
"It's not just the Muggle version of a wand. It's not even
knowledge like memorizing the periodic table. It's a different way
of <i>thinking.</i>"</p>
<p>"Perhaps..." the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was
skeptical.</p>
<p>"It is hazardous," Albus said, "to read too far into a prophecy,
even if you have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding
frustration."</p>
<p>"So I see," Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his
forehead. "But... okay, if <i>this</i> is really all we know...
look, I'll just put it bluntly. How do you <i>know</i> that the
Dark Lord actually survived?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back in
the vast Headmaster's chair.</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, "imagine how this prophecy sounded back when
it was made. You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like
I'm destined to grow up and overthrow him. That the two of us are
meant to have a final battle where either of us must destroy all
but a remnant of the other. So You-Know-Who attacks Godric's Hollow
and <i>immediately</i> gets vanquished, leaving behind <i>some</i>
remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul. Maybe the
Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark. This prophecy could
already be fulfilled, is what I'm saying. Don't get me wrong - I do
realize that my interpretation sounds stretched. Trelawney's
phrasing doesn't seem natural for describing <i>only</i> the events
that historically happened on October 31st, 1981. Attacking a baby
and having the spell bounce off, isn't something you'd normally
call 'the power to vanquish'. But if you think of the prophecy as
being about <i>several</i> possible futures, only <i>one</i> of
which was actually realized on Halloween, then the prophecy could
already be complete."</p>
<p>"But -" Minerva blurted. "But the raid on Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"<i>If</i> the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he's the most
likely suspect for the Azkaban breakout," Harry said reasonably.
"You could even say that the Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence
for the Dark Lord surviving, because an Azkaban breakout is more
likely to happen in worlds where he's alive than worlds where he's
dead. But it's not <i>strong</i> Bayesian evidence. It's not
something that <i>can't possibly happen</i> unless the Dark Lord is
alive. Professor Quirrell, who <i>didn't</i> start from the
assumption that You-Know-Who was still around, had no trouble
thinking of his own explanation. To him, it was obvious that some
powerful wizard might want Bellatrix Black because she knew a
secret of the Dark Lord's, like some of his magical knowledge that
he'd told to only her. The priors against anyone surviving their
body's death are very low, even if it's magically possible.
<i>Most</i> times it doesn't happen. So if it's <i>just</i> the
Azkaban breakout... I'd have to say formally that it isn't enough
Bayesian evidence. The improbability of the evidence assuming that
the hypothesis is false, is not commensurate with the prior
improbability of the hypothesis."</p>
<p>"No," Severus said flatly. "The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I
would know if it were."</p>
<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> of that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would
<i>understand</i> it! I heard Trelawney's words, I remember
Trelawney's voice, and if I knew the events that matched the
prophecy, I would <i>recognize</i> them. What has already
happened... does <i>not</i> fit." The Potions Master spoke with
certainty.</p>
<p>"I'm not really sure what to do with that statement," Harry
said. His hand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead. "Maybe
it's just what you <i>think</i> happened that doesn't fit, and the
true history is different..."</p>
<p>"Voldemort <i>is</i> alive," Albus said. "There are other
indications."</p>
<p>"Such as?" Harry's reply was instant.</p>
<p>Albus paused. "There are terrible rituals by which wizards have
returned from death," Albus said slowly. "That much, anyone can
discern within history and legend. And yet those books are missing,
I could not find them; it was Voldemort who removed them, I am sure
-"</p>
<p>"So you <i>can't</i> find any books on immortality, and that
proves that You-Know-Who has them?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Albus. "There is a certain book - I will not name
it aloud - missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts
library. An ancient scroll which should have been at Borgin and
Burkes, with only an empty place on a shelf to show where it was -"
The old wizard stopped. "But I suppose," the old wizard said, as
though to himself, "you will say that even if Voldemort tried to
make himself immortal, it does not prove that he succeeded..."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever
probabilities. If there are known, particular books on immortality
rituals which are missing, that increases the probability that
someone attempted one. Which, in turn, raises the prior probability
of the Dark Lord surviving his death. This I concede, and thank you
for contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior
probability goes up <i>enough.</i>"</p>
<p>"Surely," Albus said quietly, "if you concede even a
<i>chance</i> that Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding
against?"</p>
<p>Harry inclined his head. "As you say, Headmaster. Though once a
probability drops low enough, it's also an error to go on obsessing
about it... Given that books on immortality are missing, and that
this prophecy would sound <i>somewhat</i> more natural if it refers
to the Dark Lord and I having a future battle, I agree that the
Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not just possibility. But
other probabilities must <i>also</i> be taken into account - and in
the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is <i>not</i> alive, someone
else framed Hermione."</p>
<p>"Foolishness," Severus said softly. "Utter foolishness. The Dark
Mark has not faded, nor has its master."</p>
<p>"See, <i>that's</i> what I mean by formally insufficient
Bayesian evidence. Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and
stuff, but is it <i>that</i> unlikely for a magical mark to stay
around after the maker dies? Suppose the mark is certain to
continue while the Dark Lord's sentience lives on, but <i>a
priori</i> we'd only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the
Dark Mark continuing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the
observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded' is five times as likely
to occur in worlds where the Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where
the Dark Lord is dead. Is that really commensurate with the prior
improbability of immortality? Let's say the prior odds were a
hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving. If a hypothesis is
a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and then you see
evidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus
false, you should update to believing the hypothesis is twenty
times as likely to be false as true. Odds of a hundred to one,
times a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals odds of twenty to
one that the Dark Lord is dead -"</p>
<p>"<i>Where</i> are you getting all these numbers, Potter?"</p>
<p>"That <i>is</i> the admitted weakness of the method," Harry said
readily. "But what I'm <i>qualitatively</i> getting at is why the
observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded', is not adequate support
for the hypothesis, 'The Dark Lord is immortal.' The evidence isn't
as extraordinary as the claim." Harry paused. "Not to mention that
even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn't <i>have</i> to be the
one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man once said, there could be
more than one plotter and more than one plan."</p>
<p>"Such as the Defense Professor," Severus said with a thin smile.
"I suppose I must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defense
Professor last year, after all; and the year before that, and the
year before <i>that</i>."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. "Let's
move on. Are we <i>certain</i> that this Prophecy is accurate?
Nobody messed with Professor McGonagall's memory, maybe edited or
subtracted a line?"</p>
<p>Albus paused, then spoke slowly. "There is a great spell laid
over Britain, recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far
beneath the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department
of Mysteries, they are recorded."</p>
<p>"The Hall of Prophecy," Minerva whispered. She'd read about that
place, said to be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs,
one after another appearing over the years. Merlin himself had
wrought it, it was said; the greatest wizard's final slap to the
face of Fate. Not all prophecies conduced to the good; and Merlin
had wished for at least those spoken of in prophecy, to know what
had been spoken <i>of</i> them. That was the respect Merlin had
given to their free will, that Destiny might not control them from
the outside, unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy would
have an glowing orb float to their hand, and then hear the
prophet's true voice speaking. Others who tried to touch an orb, it
was said, would be driven mad - or possibly just have their heads
explode, the legends were unclear on this point. Whatever Merlin's
original intention, the Unspeakables hadn't let anyone enter in
centuries, so far as she'd heard. <i>Works of the Ancient
Wizards</i> had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered that
tipping off the subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers
releasing whatever temporal pressures they released; and so the
heirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to
wonder (now that she'd spent a few months around Mr. Potter) how
anyone could possibly <i>know</i> that; but she also knew better
than to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to tell her. Minerva firmly
believed that you only ought to worry about Time if you were a
clock.</p>
<p>"The Hall of Prophecy," Albus confirmed lowly. "Those who are
spoken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you
see the implication, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord...
oh, my <i>parents</i>. Those who had thrice defied him. They were
also mentioned in the prophecy, so they could hear the
recording?"</p>
<p>"If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva
reported," Albus said evenly, "they did not say so to me."</p>
<p>"You took James and Lily <i>there?</i>" Minerva said.</p>
<p>"Fawkes can go to many places," Albus said. "Do not mention the
fact."</p>
<p>Harry was staring directly at Albus. "Can <i>I</i> go to this
Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The
original tone of voice might be helpful, from what I've heard."</p>
<p>Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses
as the old wizard slowly shook his head. "I think that would be
unwise," Albus said. "For reasons beyond the obvious. It is
dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some
people than others."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the
parchment. "I'll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The
next part says that the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal. Any
ideas on what that means exactly?"</p>
<p>"Surely not," said Albus, "that you must imitate his ways, in
any wise."</p>
<p>"I'm not <i>dumb,</i> Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a
thing or two about temporal paradoxes, even if it's all theoretical
to them. I won't throw away my ethics just because a signal from
the future claims it's going to happen, because then that becomes
the only reason why it happened in the first place. Still, what
<i>does</i> it mean?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," said Severus.</p>
<p>"Nor I," she said.</p>
<p>Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing
meditatively at the wood. "Eleven inches, holly, with a core of
phoenix feather," Harry said. "And the phoenix whose tail feather
is in this wand, only ever gave one other, which Mr... what was his
name, Olive-something... made into the core of the Dark Lord's
wand. <i>And</i> I'm a Parselmouth. It seemed like a lot of
coincidence even then. And now I find out there's a prophecy
stating that I'll be the Dark Lord's equal."</p>
<p>Severus's eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster's gaze,
unreadable.</p>
<p>"Could it be," Minerva said falteringly, "that You-Know-Who -
that Voldemort - transferred some of his own powers to Mr. Potter,
the night he gave him that scar? Not something he intended to do,
surely. Still... I don't see how Mr. Potter could be his
<i>equal,</i> if he had any less magic than the Dark Lord
himself..."</p>
<p>"Meh," said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. "I'd
fight the Dark Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. <i>Homo
sapiens</i> didn't become the dominant species on this planet by
having the sharpest claws or hardest armor - though I suppose some
of that point may be lost on wizards. Still, it's beneath my
dignity as a human being to be scared of anything that isn't
smarter than I am; and from what I've heard, on that particular
dimension the Dark Lord wasn't very scary."</p>
<p>The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his
customary contemptuous drawl. "You imagine yourself more
intelligent than the Dark Lord, Potter?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in fact," said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his
robes, and rolling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare
elbow. "Oh, that reminds me! Let's make sure nobody here has the
clearly visible tattoo in the standard, easily checkable location
which would mark them as a secret enemy spy."</p>
<p>Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master
before he could say anything scathing. "Tell me, Harry," Albus
said, "how would <i>you</i> have crafted the Dark Mark?"</p>
<p>"Nonstandard locations," Harry said promptly, "not easily found
without embarrassment and fuss, though of course any
security-conscious person would check anyway. Make it smaller, if
possible. Overlay another non-magical tattoo to obscure the exact
shape - better yet, cover it with a layer of fake skin -"</p>
<p>"Cunning indeed," Albus said. "But tell me, suppose you could
craft any conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising
it as you wished. What would you do then?"</p>
<p>"Make it completely invisible at all times," Harry said in tones
of stating the obvious. "You don't want there to be any detectable
difference between a spy and a non-spy."</p>
<p>"Suppose you are more cunning still," Albus said. "You are a
master of trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your
abilities to the fullest."</p>
<p>"Well -" The boy stopped, frowning. "It seems unnecessarily
complicated, more like a tactic a villain would use in a
role-playing game than something you'd try in a real-life war. But
I suppose you could put fake Dark Marks on people who aren't really
Death Eaters, and keep the Dark Marks on the real Death Eaters
invisible. But then there's the question of why people would start
believing in the first place that the Dark Mark identified a Death
Eater... I'd have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I
were going to take the problem seriously."</p>
<p>"I ask you this," Albus said, still in that mild tone, "because
I did indeed, in the early days of the war, perform such tests as
you suggested. The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did
not trust in the bare arms we saw. I had thought, afterward, that
the bearers of the Mark might hide it or show it at their will. And
yet when we hied Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that Mark
showed clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest
his innocence. What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not
know. Even Severus is still bound by his Mark not to reveal its
secrets to any who do not know them."</p>
<p>"Oh, well <i>that</i> makes it <i>obvious</i>," Harry said
promptly. "Wait, hold on - you were a <i>Death Eater?</i>" Harry
transferred his stare to Severus.</p>
<p>Severus returned a thin smile. "I still am, so far as they
know."</p>
<p>"Harry," said Albus, eyes only for the boy. "What do you mean,
that makes it obvious?"</p>
<p>"Information theory 101," the boy said in a lecturing tone.
"Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and
only if the possible values of X have different probabilities given
different states of Y. The instant you hear about anything
whatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should
immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from
nonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a
process which behaves differently in the presence of truth and
falsehood - that's why 'faith' doesn't work as a discriminant,
while 'make experimental predictions and test them' does. You say
someone with the Dark Mark can't reveal its secrets to anyone who
doesn't already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark
operates, write down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark
<i>might</i> work, then watch Professor Snape try to tell each of
those things to a confederate - maybe one who doesn't know what the
experiment is about - I'll explain binary search later so that you
can play Twenty Questions to narrow things down - and whatever he
<i>can't</i> say out loud is true. His silence would be something
that behaves differently in the presence of true statements about
the Mark, versus false statements, you see."</p>
<p>Minerva's mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed
it abruptly. Even Albus looked surprised.</p>
<p>"And after that, like I said, <i>any</i> behavioral difference
between spies and nonspies can be used to identify spies. Once
you've identified at least one magically censored secret of the
Dark Mark, you can test someone for the Dark Mark by seeing if they
can reveal that secret to somebody who doesn't already know it
-"</p>
<p><i>"Thank you, Mr. Potter."</i></p>
<p>Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was
straightening, his teeth bared in a grimace of angry triumph.
"Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the Mark. If we know we are
caught for a Death Eater, before others who have not yet seen our
bare arms, our Mark reveals itself whether we will it or no. But if
they have already seen our arms bare, it does not reveal itself;
nor if we are only being tested from suspicion. Thus the Dark Mark
seems to identify Death Eaters - but only those already found, you
perceive."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Albus said. "Thank you, Severus." He closed his eyes
briefly. "That would indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter's
notice... ah, well. And Harry's proposed test?"</p>
<p>The Potions Master shook his head. "The Dark Lord was no fool,
despite Potter's delusions. The moment such a test is suspected,
the Mark ceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint at the
possibility, but only wait for another to deduce it." Another thin
smile. "I would award you a good many House points, Mr. Potter, if
it would not compromise my cover. But as you can see, the Dark Lord
was quite cunning." His gaze grew more distant. "Oh," Severus
breathed, "he was <i>very</i> cunning indeed..."</p>
<p>Harry Potter sat still for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. The boy shook his head. "No, that can't
<i>actually</i> be true. First of all, we're talking about the kind
of logic puzzle that would appear in chapter <i>one</i> of a
Raymond Smullyan book, nowhere <i>near</i> the level of what Muggle
scientists do for a living. And second, for all I know, it took the
Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the puzzle I just
solved in five seconds -"</p>
<p>"Is it <i>that</i> inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone
could be so intelligent as yourself?" The Potions Master's voice
held more curiosity than scorn.</p>
<p>"It's called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is
equally compatible with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over
the course of five months or over the course of five seconds, but
in any given population there'll be many more people who can do it
in five months than in five seconds..." Harry pasted a hand against
his forehead. "Darn it, how can I explain this? I suppose, from
your perspective, the Dark Lord came up with a clever puzzle and I
cleverly solved it and that makes us look <i>equal</i>."</p>
<p>"I remember your first day of Potions class," the Potions Master
said dryly. "I think you have a ways still to go."</p>
<p>"Peace, Severus," Albus said. "Harry has already accomplished
more than you know. Yet tell me, Harry - why <i>do</i> you believe
the Dark Lord is less than you? Surely he is a damaged soul in many
ways. But cunning for cunning - you are not yet ready to face him,
I would judge; and I know the full tally of your deeds."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The frustrating thing about this conversation was that Harry
<i>couldn't say his actual reasons for disagreeing,</i> which
violated several basic principles of cooperative discourse.</p>
<p>He couldn't explain how Bellatrix had really been removed from
Azkaban - not by You-Know-Who in any guise, but by the combined
wits of Harry and Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry didn't want to say in front of Professor McGonagall that
the existence of brain damage implied that there were no such
things as souls. Which made a successful immortality ritual...
well, not <i>impossible,</i> Harry certainly intended to forge a
road to magical immortality <i>someday</i>, but it would be a
<i>lot harder</i> and require <i>much more ingenuity</i> than just
binding an already-existent soul to a lich's phylactery. Which no
intelligent wizard would bother doing in the first place, if they
knew their souls were immortal.</p>
<p>And the true and honest reason Harry knew the Dark Lord couldn't
have been <i>that</i> smart... well... there wasn't any tactful way
to say it, but...</p>
<p>Harry had <i>been</i> to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He'd
<i>seen</i> the laughable 'security precautions', if you could call
them that, guarding the deepest levels of the Ministry of Magic.
They didn't even have the Thief's Downfall which goblins used to
wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on people entering
Gringotts. The obvious takeover route would be to Imperius the
Minister of Magic and a few department heads, and owl a hand
grenade to anyone too powerful to Imperius. Or owl them knockout
gas, if you needed them alive and in a state of Living Death to
take hairs for Polyjuice potions. Legilimency, False Memories, the
Confundus Charm - it was ridiculous, the magical world was
<i>supersaturated</i> with ways to cheat. Harry might not do any of
those things himself, during his own takeover of Britain, since he
was constrained by Ethics... well, Harry <i>might</i> do some of
the lesser ones, since Polyjuice or a temporary Confundus or
read-only Legilimency all sounded better than an extra day of
Azkaban... but...</p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been constrained by Ethics, it was possible he
could've wiped out the eviller sections of the Wizengamot that day;
all by himself, using only a first-year's magical power, on account
of being clever enough to figure out Dementors. Though Harry might
not have been in such a great political position after that, the
surviving Wizengamot members might've found it easy and cheap to
disavow his actions for P.R. purposes and condemn him, even if the
smarter ones realized it was for the greater good... but
<i>still.</i></p>
<p>If you were completely unrestrained by ethics, armed with the
ancient secrets of Salazar Slytherin, had dozens of powerful
followers including Lucius Malfoy, and it took you more than ten
years to <i>fail</i> to overthrow the government of magical
Britain, it meant you were stupid.</p>
<p>"How can I put this..." Harry said. "Look, Headmaster, you've
got ethics, there's a lot of battle tactics you don't use because
you're not evil. And you fought the Dark Lord, a tremendously
powerful wizard who wasn't so restrained, and you held him off
<i>anyway</i>. If You-Know-Who had been super-smart <i>on top of
that</i>, you'd be <i>dead.</i> <i>All</i> of you. You'd have died
<i>instantly -</i>"</p>
<p>"Harry," Professor McGonagall said. Her voice was faltering.
"Harry, we almost <i>did</i> all die. More than half the Order of
the Phoenix died. If not for Albus - Albus Dumbledore, the greatest
wizard in two centuries, Harry - we surely would have
perished."</p>
<p>Harry passed a hand across his forehead. "I'm sorry," Harry
said. "I'm not trying to minimize what you went through. I know
that You-Know-Who was a completely evil, incredibly powerful Dark
Wizard with dozens of powerful followers, and that's... bad, yes,
definitely bad. It's just..." <i>All that isn't on remotely the
same threat scale as the enemy being smart, in which case they
Transfigure botulinum toxin and sneak a millionth of a gram into
your teacup.</i> Was there any safe way to convey that concept
without citing specifics? Harry couldn't think of one.</p>
<p>"Please, Harry," said Professor McGonagall. "Please, Harry, I
beg you - <i>take the Dark Lord seriously!</i> He is more dangerous
than -" The senior witch seemed to be having trouble finding words.
"He is <i>far</i> more dangerous than Transfiguration."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows went up before he could stop himself. A dark
chuckle came from Severus Snape's direction.</p>
<p><i>Um,</i> said the voice of Ravenclaw within him. <i>Um,
honestly Professor McGonagall is right, we're not taking this as
seriously as we'd take a scientific problem. The difficult thing is
to react</i> at all <i>to new information, instead of just flushing
it out the window. Right now it looks like we didn't shift
belief</i> at all <i>after encountering an unexpected, important
argument. Our dismissal of Lord Voldemort as a serious threat</i>
was <i>originally based on the Dark Mark being blatantly stupid. It
would require a focused effort to de-update and suspect the whole
garden-path of reasoning we went down based on that false
assumption, and we're</i> not <i>putting in that effort right
now.</i></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, just as Professor McGonagall seemed to
be about to speak again. "All right, to take this seriously, I need
to stop and think for five minutes."</p>
<p>"Please do," said Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes.</p>
<p>His Ravenclaw side divided into three.</p>
<p><i>Probability estimate,</i> said Ravenclaw One, who was acting
as moderator. <i>That the Dark Lord is alive, and as smart as we
are, and hence a genuine threat.</i></p>
<p><i>Why aren't all his enemies already dead?</i> said Ravenclaw
Two, who was prosecuting.</p>
<p><i>Note,</i> said Ravenclaw One, <i>we had already thought of
that argument so we can't use it to shift belief</i> again <i>each
time we rehearse it.</i></p>
<p><i>But what's the actual flaw in the logic?</i> said Ravenclaw
Two. <i>In worlds with a smart Lord Voldemort, everyone in the
Order of the Phoenix died in the first five minutes of the war. The
world doesn't look like that, so we don't live in that world.
QED.</i></p>
<p><i>Is that really certain?</i> asked Ravenclaw Three, who'd been
appointed as the defender. <i>Maybe there was some reason Lord
Voldemort</i> wasn't <i>fighting all-out back then -</i></p>
<p><i>Like what?</i> demanded Ravenclaw Two. <i>Furthermore,
whatever your excuse, I demand that the probability of your
hypothesis be penalized in accordance with its added complexity
-</i></p>
<p><i>Let Three talk,</i> said Ravenclaw One.</p>
<p><i>Okay... look,</i> said Ravenclaw Three. <i>First of all, we
don't</i> know <i>that anyone can take over the Ministry just with
mind control. Maybe magical Britain is really an oligarchy and you
need enough military power to intimidate the family heads into
submission -</i></p>
<p><i>Imperius them too,</i> interjected Ravenclaw Two.</p>
<p><i>- and the oligarchs have Thief's Downfall in the entrances
to</i> their <i>homes -</i></p>
<p><i>Complexity penalty!</i> cried Ravenclaw Two. <i>More
epicycles!</i></p>
<p>- <i>oh, be reasonable,</i> said Ravenclaw Three. <i>We haven't
actually</i> seen <i>anyone taking over the Ministry with a couple
of well-placed Imperius curses. We don't</i> know <i>that it can
actually be done that easily.</i></p>
<p><i>But,</i> said Ravenclaw Two, <i>even taking that into
account... it really seems like there should've been</i> some
<i>other way. Ten years of failure, really? Using only conventional
terrorist tactics? That's just... not even</i> trying.</p>
<p><i>Maybe Lord Voldemort did have more creative ideas,</i>
replied Ravenclaw Three, <i>but he didn't want to tip his hand
to</i> other <i>countries' governments, didn't want</i> them <i>to
know how vulnerable they were and install Thief's Downfall in</i>
their <i>Ministries. Not until he had Britain as a base and enough
servants to subvert</i> all <i>the other major governments
simultaneously.</i></p>
<p><i>You're assuming he wants to conquer the whole world,</i>
noted Ravenclaw Two.</p>
<p><i>Trelawney prophesized that he would be our equal,</i> intoned
Ravenclaw Three solemnly. <i>Therefore, he wanted to take over the
world.</i></p>
<p><i>And if he is your equal, and you do have to fight him
-</i></p>
<p>For an instant, Harry's mind tried to imagine the specter of two
<i>creative</i> wizards fighting an all-out-war against each
other.</p>
<p>Harry had noted all the Charms and Potions in his first-year
books that could be creatively used to kill people. He hadn't been
able to help himself. Literally. He'd <i>tried</i> to stop his
brain from doing it each time, but it was like looking at a fish
and trying to stop your brain from noticing it was a fish. What
someone could creatively do with seventh-year, or Auror-level, or
ancient lost magic such as Lord Voldemort had possessed... didn't
bear thinking about. A magically-superpowered creative-genius
psychopath wasn't a 'threat', it was an extinction event.</p>
<p>Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his
reasoning had been going down. The question was whether there was a
significant probability of facing anything so terrible as a Dark
Rationalist in the first place.</p>
<p><i>Prior odds that someone attempting an immortality ritual
would actually have it work...</i></p>
<p>Call it one to a thousand, at a generous overestimate; it was
not the case that roughly one wizard in a thousand survived their
death. Though, admittedly Harry didn't have data on how many had
attempted immortality rituals first.</p>
<p><i>What if the Dark Lord</i> is <i>as smart as us?</i> said
Ravenclaw Three. <i>You know, the way Trelawney prophesied him
being our</i> equal. <i>Then he would</i> make <i>his immortality
ritual work.</i> <i>P.S., don't forget that 'destroy all but a
remnant of the other' line.</i></p>
<p>Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional
burdensome detail; prior odds of a random population member being
that intelligent were low...</p>
<p>But Lord Voldemort wasn't a randomly selected wizard, he was one
particular wizard in the population who'd come to everyone's
attention. The puzzle of the Mark implied a certain minimum level
of intelligence, even if (hypothetically) the Dark Lord had taken
longer to think it through. Then again, in the Muggle world, all of
the extremely intelligent people Harry knew about from history had
<i>not</i> become evil dictators or terrorists. The closest thing
to that in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers, and none of
<i>them</i> had tried to take over so much as a third-world
country, a point which put upper bounds on both their possible evil
and possible goodness.</p>
<p>There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the
Order of the Phoenix <i>didn't</i> just instantly die, but those
hypotheses were more complicated and ought to get complexity
penalties. After the complexity penalties of the further excuses
were factored in, there would be a large likelihood ratio from the
hypotheses 'The Dark Lord is smart' versus 'The Dark Lord was
stupid' to the observation, 'The Dark Lord did not instantly win
the war'. That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor
of the Dark Lord being stupid... but maybe not 100:1. You couldn't
actually say that 'The Dark Lord instantly wins' had a probability
of <i>more</i> than 99 percent, assuming the Dark Lord started out
smart; the sum over all possible excuses would be more than
.01.</p>
<p>And then there was the Prophecy... which might or might not have
<i>originally</i> included a line about how Lord Voldemort would
<i>immediately</i> die if he confronted the Potters. Which Albus
Dumbledore had then edited in Professor McGonagall's memory, in
order to lure Lord Voldemort to his doom. If there <i>was</i> no
such line, the Prophecy did sound <i>somewhat</i> more like
You-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were destined to have some later
confrontation. But in <i>that</i> case, it was less likely that
Dumbledore would've come up with a plausible-sounding excuse not to
take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy...</p>
<p>Harry was wondering if he could even <i>get</i> a Bayesian
calculation out of this. Of course, the point of a subjective
Bayesian calculation wasn't that, after you made up a bunch of
numbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right
answer. The real point was that the <i>process</i> of making up
numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh
all the relative probabilities. Like realizing, as soon as you
actually <i>thought</i> about the probability of the Dark Mark
not-fading <i>if</i> You-Know-Who <i>was</i> dead, that the
probability wasn't low enough for the observation to count as
strong evidence. One version of the process was to tally hypotheses
and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation,
and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain's gut
feeling <i>after</i> you'd forced it to really <i>weigh</i>
everything. The trouble was that the items of evidence weren't
conditionally independent, and there were multiple interacting
background facts of interest...</p>
<p>...well, <i>one</i> thing at least was certain.</p>
<p>If the calculation could be done at all, it was going to take a
piece of paper and a pencil.</p>
<p>In the fireplace at one side of the Headmaster's office, the
flames suddenly flared up, turning from orange to bright billious
green.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Professor McGonagall into the uncomfortable
non-silence. "That would be Mad-Eye Moody, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Let this matter bide for now," the Headmaster said in some
relief, as he too turned to regard the Floo. "I believe we are
about to receive some news regarding it, as well."</p>

<p><i>Hypothesis: Hermione Granger</i><br />
<i>(April 8th, 1992, 6:53pm)</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who
didn't have secret meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their
dinner around four huge tables -</p>
<p>"It's funny," Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. "I didn't believe
the General when he said that what we learned would change us
forever, and we'd never be able to return to a normal life
afterward. Once we knew. Once we saw what <i>he</i> could see."</p>
<p>"I know!" said Seamus Finnigan. "I thought it was just a joke
too! Like, you know, everything else General Chaos ever said
ever."</p>
<p>"But now -" Dean said sadly. "We <i>can't</i> go back, can we?
It'd be like going back to a Muggle school after having been to
Hogwarts. We've just... we've just got to stay around each other.
That's all we can do, or we'll go crazy."</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate
another bite of veldbeest.</p>
<p>Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued.
It wasn't as <i>relentless</i> as it'd been yesterday, but now and
then the topic wandered back.</p>
<p>"Well, there must've been <i>some</i> sort of love triangle,"
said a second-year witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered
when asked if there was any relation). "The question is, which ways
was it <i>going</i> before it all went wrong? Who was in love with
who - and whether or not that person loved them back - I don't know
<i>how</i> many possibilities there are -"</p>
<p>"Sixty-four," said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who
probably should've been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff
instead. "No, wait, that's wrong. I mean, if nobody loved Malfoy
and Malfoy didn't love anyone then he wouldn't really be part of
the love triangle... this is going to take Arithmancy, could you
all wait two minutes?"</p>
<p>"It's so <i>sad,</i>" said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had
tears in her eyes. "They were just - they were just so
<i>obviously</i> meant to be together!"</p>
<p>"You mean Potter and Malfoy?" said a second-year named Colleen
Johnson. "I know - their families hated each other so much, there's
no way they <i>couldn't</i> fall in love -"</p>
<p>"No, I mean all three of them," said Sherice.</p>
<p>This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. Dean
Thomas was quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make any
sounds as it trickled out of his mouth and soaked into his
shirt.</p>
<p>"<i>Wow,</i>" said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy Hua.
"That's really... <i>sophisticated</i> of you, Sherice."</p>
<p>"Look, you all, we need to keep this realistic," said Eloise
Rosen, a tall witch who'd been General of an army and hence spoke
with an air of authority. "We <i>know</i> - because she kissed him
- that Granger was in love with Potter. So the only reason she'd
try to kill Malfoy is if she knew that she was losing Potter to
him. There's no need to make it all sound so complicated - you're
all acting like this is a play instead of real life!"</p>
<p>"But even if Granger was in love, it's still funny that she'd
just <i>snap</i> like that," said Chloe, whose black robes combined
with her night-black skin to make her look like a darkened
silhouette. "I don't know... I think maybe there's more to this
than just a romance novel gone wrong. I think maybe most people
haven't got any idea at all what's going on."</p>
<p>"<i>Yes! Thank you!</i>" burst out Dean Thomas. "Look - don't
you realize - like Harry Potter <i>told</i> us all - if you didn't
<i>predict</i> that something would happen, if it took you
completely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when
you <i>didn't</i> see it coming, isn't enough to explain..." Dean's
voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening. "It's
<i>completely hopeless,</i> isn't it?"</p>
<p>"You hadn't figured that out yet?" said Lavender Brown, who was
sitting across the table from her two fellow former Chaotics.
"How'd you ever make Lieutenant?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you two be quiet!" Sherice snapped at them. "It's obvious
you both want the three of them for yourselves!"</p>
<p>"I mean it!" Chloe said. "What if what's <i>really</i> going on
is different from all the, you know, <i>normal</i> things that all
the <i>ordinary</i> people are talking about? What if somebody -
<i>made</i> Granger do what she did, just like Potter was trying to
tell everyone?"</p>
<p>"I think Chloe's right," said a foreign-looking boy wizard who
always introduced himself as 'Adrian Turnipseed', though his
parents had actually named him Mad Drongo. "I think this whole time
there's been..." Adrian lowered his voice ominously, "...a
<i>hidden hand</i>..." Adrian raised his voice again, "shaping all
that's happened. One person who's been behind <i>everything,</i>
from the beginning. And I don't mean Professor Snape, either."</p>
<p>"You don't mean -" gasped Sarah.</p>
<p>"Yes," Adrian said. "The <i>real</i> one behind it all is -
<i>Tracey Davis!</i>"</p>
<p>"That's what I think too," Chloe said. "After all -" She glanced
around rapidly. "Ever since that thing with the bullies and the
ceiling - even the trees in the forests around Hogwarts look like
they're <i>shaking,</i> like they're <i>afraid -</i>"</p>
<p>Seamus Finnigan was frowning thoughtfully. "I think I see where
Harry gets his... <i>you know...</i> from," Seamus said, lowering
his voice so that only Lavender and Dean could hear.</p>
<p>"Oh, I totally know what you mean," Lavender said. She didn't
bother to lower her own voice. "It's a wonder he didn't crack and
just start killing everyone <i>ages</i> ago."</p>
<p>"Personally," Dean said, also in a quieter voice, "I'd say the
really scary part is - that could've been <i>us.</i>"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Lavender. "It's a good thing <i>we're</i> all
perfectly sane now."</p>
<p>Dean and Seamus nodded solemnly.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Hypothesis: G. L.<br />
(April 8th, 1992, 8:08pm)</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Floo-Fire of the Headmaster's office blazed a bright
pale-green, the fire concentrating in on itself into a spinning
emeraldine whirlwind, and then flared even brighter and spit a
human figure into the air -</p>
<p>There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a
wand, smoothly spinning with the Floo's momentum like a ballet
dance step, so that his firing arc covered the entire 360-degree
arc of the room; and then just as abruptly, the figure stopped in
place.</p>
<p>In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even
took in the eye, he noticed the scars on the hands, the scars on
the face, like the man had been burned and cut over his entire
body; though only the man's hands and face were visible, of all his
flesh. The rest of the man's body was hidden, encased not in robes,
but in leather that looked more like armor than clothing; dark gray
leather, matching the man's mess of grayed hair.</p>
<p>The next thing that Harry's vision comprehended was the
brilliant blue eye occupying the right side of the man's face.</p>
<p>One part of Harry's mind realized that the person whom Professor
McGonagall had named 'Mad-Eye Moody' was the same as the one
Dumbledore had called 'Alastor', within the memory Dumbledore had
shown Harry; an image from before whatever event had scarred every
inch of the man's body and taken a chunk out of his nose -</p>
<p>And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline.
Harry had drawn his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out
of the Floo like that, there'd been something about it that felt
like <i>ambush,</i> Harry's hand had already started to level his
wand for a <i>Somnium</i> before he'd managed to stop himself. Even
now the armored man was holding his wand level, not pointed at any
particular person but covering the whole room, and that wand was
already in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sighting down
a gun. There was danger in the man's stance and the set of his
boots, danger in the leather armor he wore and danger in that
brilliant blue eye.</p>
<p>When the scarred man spoke, addressing the Headmaster, his voice
was edged. "I suppose you think this room is secure?"</p>
<p>"There are only friends here," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>The man's head jerked toward Harry. "That include
<i>him?</i>"</p>
<p>"If Harry Potter is not our friend," Dumbledore said gravely,
"then we are all certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he
is."</p>
<p>The man's wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry. "Boy
almost drew on me just then."</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. He noticed that his hand was still tightly
holding the wand, and consciously relaxed his hand and dropped it
back to his side. "Sorry about that, you looked a bit...
combat-ready."</p>
<p>The scarred man's wand moved slightly away from where it had
almost pointed at Harry, though it didn't lower, and the man let
out a short bark of laughter. "Constant vigilance, eh, lad?" said
the man.</p>
<p>"It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you," Harry
recited the proverb.</p>
<p>The man turned fully toward Harry; and insofar as Harry could
read any expression on the scarred face, the man now looked
<i>interested</i>.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes had regained some of the brilliant twinkle
that they'd had before the Azkaban breakout, a smile beneath his
silver mustache as though that smile had never left. "Harry, this
is Alastor Moody, called also Mad-Eye, who will command the Order
of the Phoenix after me - if anything should happen to me, that is.
Alastor, this is Harry Potter. I have every hope the two of you
shall get along <i>fantastically</i>."</p>
<p>"I've heard a good deal about you, boy," said Mad-Eye Moody. His
one dark natural eye stayed fixed on Harry, while the point of
brilliant blue spun frantically, seeming to rotate all the way
around within its socket. "Not all of it good. Heard they're
calling you the Dementor Spooker, in the Department."</p>
<p>After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowing
smile.</p>
<p>"How'd you pull off that one, boy?" the man said softly. Now his
blue eye was fixed on Harry as well. "I had a little chat with one
of the Aurors who escorted the Dementor there from Azkaban. Beth
Martin said it came straight from the pit, and no-one gave it any
special instructions along the way. Of course, she could be
lying."</p>
<p>"There wasn't any sneaky trick to that one," Harry said. "I just
did it the hard way. Of course, I could also be lying."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was leaning back in his chair, chuckling in the
background, like he was just another device in the Headmaster's
Office and that was the sound he made.</p>
<p>The scarred man turned back to face the Headmaster, though his
wand stayed pointed low and in Harry's general direction. When he
spoke his voice was gruff and businesslike. "I have a lead on a
recent host of Voldie's. You're certain his shade is in Hogwarts
now?"</p>
<p>"Not <i>certain</i> -" Dumbledore began.</p>
<p>"Say <i>what?</i>" Harry interrupted. After having nearly
concluded that the Dark Lord didn't exist, it was a shock to hear
it being discussed that matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>"Voldie's host," Moody said shortly. "The one he possessed
before he took over Granger."</p>
<p>"If the tales speak true," Dumbledore said, "there is some
device of power which binds Voldemort's shade to this world; and by
that means he may bargain with a host for possession of their body,
conferring on them some portion of his power and his pride -"</p>
<p>"So the obvious question is who's gained too much power too
quickly," Moody said abruptly. "And it turns out that there's a
fellow who's gone and banished the Bandon Banshee, staked an entire
rogue vampire clan in Asia, tracked down the Wagga-Wagga Werewolf,
and exterminated a pack of ghouls using a tea-strainer. <i>And</i>
he's milking it for all it's worth; there's been talk of the Order
of Merlin. Seems to have turned into a charmer and a politician,
not just a powerful wizard."</p>
<p>"Dear me," murmured Dumbledore. "Are you certain that he is not
relying on his own skills?"</p>
<p>"Checked his grades," Moody said. "Record shows Gilderoy
Lockhart received a Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn't bother
with the N.E.W.T. Just the sort of sucker to take the deal Voldie
was offering." The blue eye whirled crazily within its socket.
"Unless you remember Lockhart as a student, and think he had enough
potential to do all that by himself?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor McGonagall. She frowned. "Not a chance, I
should say."</p>
<p>"I fear I must agree," Dumbledore said with an undertone of
pain. "Ah, Gilderoy, you poor fool..."</p>
<p>Moody's grin was more like a snarl. "Three in the morning work
for you, Albus? Lockhart should be at his home tonight."</p>
<p>Harry listened to this with increasing alarm, wondering if even
the <i>Ministry</i> had any rules about magistrates needing to
issue warrants - never mind the illegal vigilante organization
Harry now seemed to have joined. "Excuse me," Harry said. "What
<i>exactly</i> happens at three in the morning?"</p>
<p>There must have been something in Harry's voice that gave him
away, because the scarred man whirled on him. "You have a problem
with that, boy?"</p>
<p>Harry paused, trying to figure out how to phrase this to the
stranger -</p>
<p>"You want to take him down yourself?" pressed the scarred man.
"Get revenge for your parents, eh?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said as politely he could. "Honestly - look, if we
knew for <i>certain</i> he was a willing host for You-Know-Who,
that's one thing, but if we're <i>not</i> sure and you're heading
off to kill him -"</p>
<p>"Kill?" Mad-Eye Moody snorted. "It's what's locked up in his
head," Moody tapped his forehead, "that we need from him, boy. If
we're lucky, Voldie can't wipe the sucker's memories as easy as in
his living days, and Lockhart will remember what the horcrux looked
like."</p>
<p>Harry mentally noted down the word <i>horcrux</i> for future
research, and said, "I'm just worried that someone innocent - what
sounds like a pretty decent person, if he <i>did</i> do all that
himself - might be about to get hurt."</p>
<p>"Aurors hurt people," the scarred man said shortly. "Bad people,
if you're lucky. Some days you won't be lucky, and that's all there
is to it. Just remember, Dark Wizards hurt a lot more people than
we do."</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Can you at least <i>try</i> not to
hurt this person, in case he's <i>not -</i>"</p>
<p>"What is a first-year doing in this room, Albus?" demanded the
scarred man, now whirling to face the Headmaster. "And don't tell
me it's for what he did when he was a baby."</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is not an ordinary first-year," the Headmaster
said quietly. "He has already accomplished feats impossible enough
to shock even me, Alastor. His is the only intellect in the Order
which might someday match that of Voldemort himself, as you or I
never could."</p>
<p>The scarred man leaned over the Headmaster's desk. "He's a
liability. Naive. Doesn't know a bloody thing about what war's
like. I want him out of here and all his memories of the Order
wiped before one of Voldie's servants plucks them straight out of
his mind -"</p>
<p>"I'm an Occlumens, actually."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody directed a narrow look at the Headmaster, who
nodded.</p>
<p>And then the scarred man turned to face Harry, their gazes
meeting.</p>
<p>The sudden fury of the Legilimency attack almost made Harry fall
off his chair, as a blade of white-hot steel cut into the imaginary
person at the forefront of his mind. Harry hadn't had a chance to
practice since Mr. Bester's training, and Harry very nearly lost
his grip on the imaginary person the back-of-his-mind was
pretending to be, as that person's world turned into searing lava
and a furious probe of questions. Harry almost lost his grip on
only <i>pretending</i> to hallucinate, only <i>pretending</i> to be
the imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as the
Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe that
he was on fire -</p>
<p>Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody's
chin.</p>
<p>"You're out of practice, boy," Moody said. Harry wasn't looking
at the man's face, but his voice was deadly grim. "And I'll warn
you of this but once. Voldie isn't like any other Legilimens in
recorded history. He doesn't need to look you in the eyes, and if
your shields are that rusty he'd creep in so softly you'd never
notice a thing."</p>
<p>"Duly noted," Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more
shaken than he'd have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn't been anywhere
near that powerful, and had never tested Harry like <i>that</i>.
Pretending to be someone hurting that much had... Harry couldn't
find words for describing what it felt like to contain an imaginary
person in that much pain, but it hadn't been <i>normal</i>. "Do I
get any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?"</p>
<p>"So you're think you're all grown up already, eh? Look me in the
eyes!"</p>
<p>Harry strengthened his shields, and looked once more into the
dark grey eye and the brilliant blue.</p>
<p>"Ever watched someone die?" asked Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>"My parents," Harry said evenly. "I recovered the memory in
January when I went in front of a Dementor to learn the Patronus
Charm. I remember You-Know-Who's voice -" A chill went through
Harry's body, his wand twitching in his hand. "My main tactical
report is that You-Know-Who could speak the Killing Curse in less
than half a second, but you probably already knew that."</p>
<p>There was a gasp from Professor McGonagall's direction, and
Severus's face had tightened.</p>
<p>"All right," Mad-Eye Moody said softly. A strange, thin grin
twisted up the lips within the scarred face. "I'll make you the
same offer I'd make to any trainee Auror. Land one touch on me, boy
- one hit, one spell - and I'll concede your right to talk back to
me."</p>
<p>"Alastor!" exclaimed Professor McGonagall's voice. "Surely
that's an unreasonable test! Mr. Potter, whatever his other merits,
does not have a hundred years of fighting experience!"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes made a lightning dart around the room, passing over
the peculiar devices, glancing past Dumbledore and Severus and the
Sorting Hat, settling briefly here and there. Harry couldn't see
Professor McGonagall from where he was, but that didn't matter.
There was only one device he'd really wanted to look at, and the
point of all the other glances had just been to conceal which
one.</p>
<p>"All righty," Harry said, and hopped off his chair, ignoring
Professor McGonagall's inhalation and the Potions Master's snort of
disbelief. Dumbledore's eyebrows had lifted, and Moody was grinning
like a tiger. "Be sure to wake me up in forty minutes if he does
get me." Harry settled into a duelist's starting stance, his wand
held low. "Let's go, then -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed
with cotton wool.</p>
<p>Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster's office, the
Floo-Fire dimmed; only Dumbledore still waited behind the desk.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," the Headmaster said quietly.</p>
<p>"I didn't even see him <i>move,</i>" Harry marvelled, muscles
creaking as he sat up.</p>
<p>"You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody," said
Dumbledore, "and you took your eye off his wand."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his
pouch. "I mean - I was taking the dueling stance so that he'd think
I was a standard idiot and underestimate me - but I have to admit,
<i>that</i> was impressive."</p>
<p>"So you planned it all along, Harry?" Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "Note how I'm doing this as soon as I
wake up, rather than pausing to think of it."</p>
<p>Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back
up at the wall clock he'd surreptitiously glanced at earlier.</p>
<p>It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and
now it was five minutes after nine.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva stared as the boy put himself into the dueling stance,
his wand held low. For a second Minerva wondered if Harry might
possibly - no, that was completely ridiculous, it was <i>Mad-Eye
Moody</i> and that was beyond impossible. Of course that was what
she'd thought about his partial Transfiguration, too...</p>
<p>"Let's go, then," Harry said and fell over.</p>
<p>Severus gave a single chuckle. "Mr. Potter has his points, I
must confess," the Potions Master said. "Though I would never say
it while he was awake, and if you repeat the words I shall deny
them, for the boy's ego is quite large enough already. Mr. Potter
does have his points, Mad-Eye, but duelling is not among them."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's own chuckle was lower and grimmer. "Oh, yes," said
Mad-Eye. "Only fools duel. Standing like that and waiting for me to
attack, what <i>was</i> the boy thinking? Why, I ought to give him
a scar, to remember this occasion -"</p>
<p>"Alastor!" barked Albus, just as she cried "Stop!", Severus
dashed forward, and Mad-Eye Moody deliberately leveled his wand on
Harry Potter's body.</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's body seemed to almost flicker as he spun on his wooden
foot like lightning, faster than she'd ever seen anyone move
without magic, the red Stunning Hex passing through the suddenly
empty air and barely missing Severus to crash into the opposite
wall, and by the time her eyes jerked back to Moody there were
seventeen radiant orbs in the pattern of a <i>Sagitta Magica,</i>
visible for only an instant before they streaked brilliance and
struck <i>something</i> that fell to the floor with a thud -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hello again, Harry," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"I cannot <i>believe</i> that guy's reaction time," Harry said,
brushing off his Cloak as he stood up from where he'd been lying
invisible on the floor, unseen by his previous self. "I can't
believe his movement speed either. I'm going to have to figure out
some way to zap him without speaking an incantation that gives it
away..."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>- and then Mad-Eye ducked hard and fast, his hands hitting flat
on the floor. She almost didn't see the two tiny white threads
passing through the space he'd been, but her eyes went to the blue
spark when the threads impacted on one of the Headmaster's devices,
and by the time she managed to turn her eyes back, Mad-Eye had spun
smoothly up to his feet, his wand was dancing unseeably fast and
there was another thudding sound -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hello again, Harry."</p>
<p>"Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your
stairs, and then come back up again, before I make the final jump
backward? This is going to take longer than one hour of preparation
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva gaped at Mad-Eye Moody, who hadn't lowered his wand in
the slightest; and Severus had a look on his face that was almost
like shock.</p>
<p>"Well, boy?" said Mad-Eye Moody. "What else have you got?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's head appeared, floating in midair as an invisible
hand drew back the hood of his invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>"That eye," said Harry Potter. There was a strange fierce light
in the boy's eyes. "That isn't any ordinary device. It can see
right through my invisibility cloak. You dodged my Transfigured
taser as soon as I started raising it, even though I didn't speak
any incantations. And now that I've watched it again - you spotted
all my Time-Turned selves the moment you Flooed into this room,
didn't you?"</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody was smiling, the same teeth-bared grin she'd seen
him wear as they'd faced off against Voldemort himself. "Spend a
hundred years hunting Dark wizards, and you see everything," said
Moody. "I once arrested a young Japanese who tried a similar trick.
He found out the hard way that his shadow replica technique was no
match for this eye of mine."</p>
<p>"You see in all directions," Harry Potter said, that strange
fierce light still in his gaze. "No matter where that eye is
pointing, it sees everything around you."</p>
<p>Moody's tiger-grin grew wider. "There's no more of you in this
room, now," Mad-Eye said. "Think that's because you'll give up
after this time, or because you'll win? Any bets, boy?"</p>
<p>"It's my final attempt because I decided to stake my last three
hours on one shot," said Harry Potter. "As for whether I win -"</p>
<p>There was a blur filling the whole air of the Headmaster's
office. Mad-Eye Moody leapt to one side with blinding speed and an
instant later Harry's head darted backward as he cried
"<i>Stuporfy!</i>"</p>
<p>Three shimmers in the air went past Harry's moving head, just as
a red bolt erupted from Harry's location, shooting past Moody as he
dodged in yet another direction -</p>
<p>If she'd blinked, she would have missed it, the red bolt making
an angled turn in midair and slamming into Moody's ear.</p>
<p>Moody fell.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's floating head dropped to the height of a
first-year on their hands and knees, then dropped further to the
ground, his face showing sudden exhaustion.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall said, "What in <i>Merlin's name</i> just
-"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"So you went to Flitwick, then," Moody said. The retired Auror
was now sitting in a chair, drinking long draughts from a
restorative in a bottle he'd taken off his belt.</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of
perched on an armrest. "I tried the Defense Professor first, but -"
The boy grimaced. "He... wasn't available. Well, I'd decided it was
worth risking five House points, and if you say a risk is worth it,
you can't complain when you have to pay up. Anyway, I figured that
if you had an eye that saw things other people couldn't see, then
as Isaac Asimov pointed out in <i>Second Foundation</i>, the weapon
to use is a brilliant light. Read enough science fiction, you know,
and you'll read everything at least once. Anyway, I told Professor
Flitwick that I needed a Charm that would make a huge number of
shapes, bright and flickering and filling the whole office, but
invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had no idea what it
would even <i>mean</i> to cast an illusion and then make it
invisible, but I figured if I didn't mention that out loud,
Professor Flitwick would just do it anyway, and he did. Turns out
there was no spell like that I could cast myself, but Flitwick
Charmed me a one-time device for it - though I had to persuade him
that it wasn't cheating, since nothing could <i>possibly</i> be
cheating against an Auror who'd lived long enough to retire. And
then I still didn't see how I could hit you, when you were moving
that fast. So I asked about targeted spells, and that was when
Flitwick showed me that hex I cast at the end, the Swerving
Stunner. It's one of Professor Flitwick's own inventions - he's a
champion duellist as well as a Charms Master -"</p>
<p>"I know that, son."</p>
<p>"Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit
before he got a chance to use that spell, since it only works as a
finishing move on an unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to
the target as possible along its original trajectory, and then once
it detects that the target is getting more distant again, the hex
turns in midair and heads straight for the target. It can only
swerve once - but the incantation sounds very close to 'Stupefy'
and the hex is the same red color, so if the enemy thinks it's a
regular Stunning Hex and tries a normal dodge, that midair
retargeting will finish them off. Oh, and the Professor requested
that none of us talk about his special move, just in case he does
get a chance to use it during competition someday."</p>
<p>"But -" said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody,
who was nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping his
face decidedly blank. "Mr. Potter, you just stunned <i>Mad-Eye
Moody!</i> The most famous Dark wizard hunter in the history of the
Auror Office! That should've been impossible!"</p>
<p>Moody let out a dark chuckle. "What's <i>your</i> answer to that
one, kid? I'm curious."</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. "First of all, Professor McGonagall,
neither of us were fighting seriously."</p>
<p><i>"Neither of you?"</i></p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "In a serious fight, Mr. Moody would've
dropped all my copies immediately without waiting for them to
attack. And on my side, if it was <i>actually</i> necessary to take
down the most famous Auror in the history of the office, I'd get
Headmaster Dumbledore to do it for me. And beyond that... since
that <i>wasn't</i> a real fight..." Harry paused. "How can I put
this? Wizards are used to duels where people fight back and forth
with spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in a
small room and fire bullets at each other... then whoever hits
first, wins. And if one of them is deliberately missing his shots,
giving the other person one chance after another - like Mr. Moody
gave me one chance after another - well, you'd have to be pretty
pathetic to lose."</p>
<p>"Oh, not <i>that</i> pathetic," Moody said with a slightly
threatening grin.</p>
<p>Harry didn't seem to notice. "You might say that Mr. Moody was
testing me to see if I would try to <i>fight</i> him, or try to
<i>win.</i> That is, whether I'd carry out the <i>role</i> of
somebody fighting - use standard spells I already knew, even though
I didn't expect the <i>consequences</i> of that action to be
victory - or if I'd search through unusual plans until I found
something that <i>could</i> win. Like the difference between a
student who sits in class because that's what students do, versus a
student who cares enough to ask themselves what it takes to
<i>actually</i> learn a piece of material, and practices however
necessary - you see, Professor McGonagall? When you look at it that
way - realize that Mr. Moody was giving me chances, and that I
shouldn't attack in the first place unless I think I can win - then
I don't come out looking so well, since it actually took me three
tries to get him. Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr. Moody
could've turned <i>himself</i> invisible, or put up shields -"</p>
<p>"Don't go relying too much on shields, boy," Mad-Eye said. The
leather-clad Auror took another sip from his restorative flask.
"What you learn in your first year at the academy doesn't stay true
forever, not against the strongest Dark Wizards. Every shield ever
made, there's some curse that goes straight through it, if you're
not quick enough to cast the counter. And there's one curse that
goes through everything, and it's a curse any Death Eater will
use."</p>
<p>Harry Potter nodded gravely. "Right, some spells are impossible
to block. I'll remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing
Curse at me. Again."</p>
<p>"That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don't you
forget it."</p>
<p>A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. "I know. Sorry."</p>
<p>"So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go
after Lockhart?"</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then paused. "I won't tell you how to
run a war," the Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. "I don't have any
experience at that. All I know is that there are consequences.
Please be advised that my own assessment is that Lockhart is
probably innocent, so if you can avoid hurting him without too much
risk -" The boy shrugged. "I don't know the cost. Just please, if
you can, be careful not to hurt him if he's innocent."</p>
<p>"If I can," said Moody.</p>
<p>"And - you're aiming to look through his mind for evidence about
the Dark Lord, aren't you? I don't know what the rules are in
magical Britain about admissible evidence - but everyone's always
guilty of breaking <i>some</i> law or another, there's just too
many laws. So if it's <i>not</i> about the Dark Lord, don't turn
him in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go, okay?"</p>
<p>Moody frowned. "Son, nobody gains power that fast without being
up to <i>something.</i>"</p>
<p>"Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find
evidence the ordinary way. Please, Mr. Moody. Call it a quirk of my
Muggle upbringing, but if it's <i>not</i> about the war I don't
want us to be the evil police who break into people's houses in the
middle of the night, rummage through their minds and send them off
to Azkaban."</p>
<p>"I don't see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you
the favor."</p>
<p>"Is there aught else, Alastor?" inquired Albus.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Moody. "About that Defense Professor of yours -"</p>
<p><i>Hypothesis: Gilderoy Lockhart: END</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Hypothesis: Dumbledore</i><br />
<i>(April 9th, 1992, 5:32pm)</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup
jerked in midair, sending the dark translucent liquid just barely
slopping over the side, so that only three single drops crawled
down the side of the teacup. Harry would have missed it, if he
hadn't happened to be watching closely; for Professor Quirrell's
hand was perfectly steady on the cup before and after.</p>
<p>If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it
would be the end of any non-wandless magic for the Defense
Professor. Wandwork had no room for trembling fingers. How much
that would <i>actually</i> handicap Professor Quirrell, if at all,
Harry couldn't guess. The Defense Professor was certainly capable
of wandless magic, yet still tended to use a wand for larger things
- but for him that might only be a convenience...</p>
<p>"Insanity," said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from
his tea - he was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was
unusual for him - "can be a signature all its own."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's small office was silent, the
sound-warded room quiet in a way the Headmaster's office never
could be. Sometimes the two of them both happened to finish
exhaling or inhaling at the same time; and then there was an
auditory emptiness that was almost a sound in itself.</p>
<p>"I'll agree with that in one sense," Harry said. "If somebody
tells me that everyone is <i>staring</i> at them and that their
underwear is being dusted with thought-controlling powder, I know
they're psychotic, because that's the standard signature of
psychosis. But if you tell me that <i>anything</i> confusing points
to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems... overreaching. Just
because I can't see a purpose doesn't mean there <i>is</i> no
purpose."</p>
<p>"Purposeless?" said Professor Quirrell. "Oh, but the madness of
Dumbledore is not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many
purposes. The Headmaster might have planned this to make Lucius
Malfoy throw away his game for vengeance on you - or it might be a
dozen other plots. Who knows what the Headmaster thinks he has
reason to do, when he has found reason to do so many strange things
already?"</p>
<p>Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor
Quirrell would know what it meant. He'd considered bringing his own
can of soda - but had decided against that as well, after realizing
how easy it would be for the Defense Professor to teleport in a bit
of potion, even if the two of them couldn't touch each other with
direct magic.</p>
<p>"I have seen a little now of Dumbledore," Harry said. "Unless
everything I have seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe
that he would plot to send any Hogwarts student to Azkaban.
Ever."</p>
<p>"Ah," the Defense Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of
the teacup gleaming in his pale eyes. "But perhaps that is another
signature, Mr. Potter. You have not yet comprehended the
perspective of a man like Dumbledore. If he must, in some
sufficiently noble cause, sacrifice a student - why, who would he
choose, but she who declared herself a heroine?"</p>
<p>That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but
that <i>did</i> seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses's
probability mass onto framing Hermione in particular. Similarly,
Professor Quirrell <i>had</i> predicted in advance that Dumbledore
might target Draco...</p>
<p><i>But if it's you behind all of this, Professor, you might have
shaped your plans to frame the Headmaster, and taken care to cast
suspicion on him in advance.</i></p>
<p>The concept of 'evidence' had something of a different meaning,
when you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves to
play the game at 'one level higher than you'.</p>
<p>"I see your point, Professor," Harry said evenly, giving no hint
of his other thoughts. "So you think it most probable that it was
the Headmaster who framed Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, Mr. Potter." Professor Quirrell drained his
teacup in one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp
rap as it descended. "There is also Severus Snape - though what he
might think to gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my
prime suspect either."</p>
<p>"Then who is?" Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrell
surely wasn't about to reply 'You-Know-Who' -</p>
<p>"The Aurors have a rule," said Professor Quirrell. "Investigate
the victim. Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the
apparent victims of a crime, they shall not be suspected. So many
criminals imagine it, indeed, that every senior Auror has seen it a
dozen times over."</p>
<p>"You're not seriously trying to convince me that <i>Hermione</i>
-"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed
<i>looks</i> that meant he was being stupid.</p>
<p><i>Draco?</i> Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum -
but Lucius might have had enough control to subvert Aurors to...
oh.</p>
<p>"You think <i>Lucius Malfoy</i> set up <i>his own son?</i>"
Harry said.</p>
<p>"Why not?" Professor Quirrell said softly. "From Mr. Malfoy's
recorded testimony, Mr. Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some
success in changing Mr. Malfoy's political views. If Lucius Malfoy
learned of that earlier... he might have decided that his
<i>former</i> heir had become a liability."</p>
<p>"I don't buy it," Harry said flatly.</p>
<p>"You are being wantonly naive, Mr. Potter. The history books are
full of family disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and
threats far less than those which Mr. Malfoy posed to his father. I
suppose next you will tell me that Lord Malfoy of the Death Eaters
is far too gentle to wish his son such harm." A tinge of heavy
sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Well, yes, frankly," Harry said. "Love is real, Professor, a
phenomenon with observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are
real, and love is as much a part of the real world as apples and
trees. If you made experimental predictions without taking parental
love into account, you'd have a heck of a time explaining why my
own parents didn't abandon me at an orphanage after the Incident
with the Science Project."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.</p>
<p>Harry continued. "From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him
over important Wizengamot votes. That's significant evidence, since
there's less expensive ways to fake love, if you just want to fake
it. And it's not like the prior probability of a parent loving
their child is <i>low</i>. I suppose it's possible that Lucius was
just taking on the <i>role</i> of a loving father, and he renounced
that role after he learned Draco was consorting with Muggleborns.
But as the saying goes, Professor, one must distinguish possibility
from probability."</p>
<p>"All the better the crime," the Defense Professor said, still in
that soft tone, "if no one would believe it of him."</p>
<p>"And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first
place, without setting off the wards? <i>He's</i> not a Professor -
oh, right, you think it's Professor Snape."</p>
<p>"Wrong," said the Defense Professor. "Lucius Malfoy would trust
no servant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor,
intelligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no
great fighting ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley
the black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth - he would go in person,
for this - and speaks to her a single word."</p>
<p>"<i>Imperio</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Legilimens,</i> rather," said Professor Quirrell. "I do not
know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning Professor
under the Imperius Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy probably
does not know either. But Malfoy is a perfect Occlumens at least;
he might be able to use Legilimency. And for the target...perhaps
Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy Professor moving
about at night."</p>
<p>"Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout," said Harry. "Since
she's the last person anyone would suspect."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. "Perhaps."</p>
<p>"Actually," Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his
face, "I don't suppose you know offhand if any of the current
Professors at Hogwarts were around back when Mr. Hagrid got framed
in 1943?"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught Magical
Creatures, and Vector taught Arithmancy," Professor Quirrell said
at once. "And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient
Runes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr. Potter, there is no
reason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was involved in
<i>that</i> affair."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged artfully. "Seemed worth asking the question, just
to check. Anyway, Professor, I agree it's possible that some
outsider Legilimized a member of Hogwarts staff - and then
Obliviated them afterward, there's no way anyone would forget that
part. But I <i>don't</i> think Lucius Malfoy is a probable
candidate for the mastermind. It's possible but not probable that
all of Lucius's apparent love for Draco was just a sense of duty,
and that it all went up in a puff of smoke. It's possible though
not probable that everything Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot
was just an act. People's outsides do not always resemble their
insides, like you said. But there's one piece of evidence that
doesn't fit at all."</p>
<p>"And that would be?" said the Defense Professor, his eyes
half-lidded.</p>
<p>"Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for
Hermione's life. I saw how surprised the Wizengamot was, when
Lucius said he was refusing it despite the rules of honor. The
Wizengamot didn't <i>expect</i> that of him. Why <i>wouldn't</i> he
just take the money while acting all indignant and pretending to
grit his teeth? He wouldn't actually care that much about throwing
Hermione into Azkaban."</p>
<p>There was a pause. "Perhaps the role he was playing ran away
with him," said Professor Quirrell. "It does happen, Mr. Potter, in
the heat of the moment."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Harry said. "But it's still one more
<i>improbability</i> to be postulated - and by the time you have to
add up that many excuses in a theory, it can't be at the top of the
list anymore. Anything else in particular you think I ought to
think about, within the range of all other possibilities?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The Defense Professor's eyes dropped
down to look at the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually
distant.</p>
<p>"I suppose I can think of one final suspect," the Defense
Professor said at last.</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor didn't seem to notice, but only spoke on.
"Has the Headmaster has told you anything - even a hint - about
Professor Trelawney's prophecy?"</p>
<p>"<i>Huh?</i>" Harry said automatically, converting his own
sudden shock into the best dissembling he could manage. It probably
was at the wrong level to fool Professor Quirrell but Harry
<i>certainly</i> couldn't take time to think before replying -
<i>wait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell know about</i>
that <i>-</i> "Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?"</p>
<p>"You <i>were</i> there to hear its beginning," Professor
Quirrell said, frowning. "You called out to the entire school that
the prophecy could not be about you, since you were not coming
here, you were already here."</p>
<p><i>HE IS COMING. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY -</i></p>
<p>And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had gotten before
Dumbledore had grabbed her and vanished.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> prophecy," Harry said. "Sorry! It went clear
out of my mind."</p>
<p>Harry thought he'd put too much force into the end statement,
and was 80%-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, <i>Aha, now Mr.
Potter, what is this mysterious</i> other <i>prophecy you went to
such lengths to deny -</i></p>
<p>"That is foolish," the Defense Professor said sharply, "if
indeed you are telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial
things. I have racked my brain much over the little that I heard,
but such a small fragment is simply too little."</p>
<p>"You think the one who's coming is the one who might've framed
Hermione?" said Harry. As his mind allocated yet another
hypothesis, <i>uncertain predicate referent,
he-who-is-coming.</i></p>
<p>"With no offense meant to Miss Granger," the Defense Professor
said with another frown, "her life or death does not seem that
important. But someone <i>was</i> to come - one who, in your
interpretation, was not already there - and someone so significant,
and unknown as a player... who knows what <i>else</i> they may have
done?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have
to redo his Lord-Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece
of evidence in the mix.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out like
through slits. "More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke -
who was meant to <i>hear</i> it? It is said that fates are spoken
to those with the power to cause them or avert them. Dumbledore.
Myself. You. As a distant fourth, Severus Snape. But of those four,
Dumbledore and Snape would often be in Trelawney's presence. You
and I are the ones who would not have spent much time around her
before that Sunday. I think it quite likely that the prophecy was
meant for one of <i>us</i> - before Dumbledore took the prophetess
away. <i>Did</i> the Headmaster say nothing more to you?" Professor
Quirrell's voice was demanding now. "I thought I heard too much
force in that denial, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Honestly, no," Harry said. "It had honestly slipped clear out
of my mind."</p>
<p>"Then I am rather put out with him," Professor Quirrell said
softly. "In fact, I think that I am angry."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing. He didn't even sweat. It might've been a
poor reason for confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did
happen to be innocent.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in
acknowledgment. "If there is nothing more to say between us, Mr.
Potter, you may go."</p>
<p>"I can think of one <i>other</i> suspect," Harry said. "Someone
you didn't put on your list at all. Would you analyze him to me,
Professor?"</p>
<p>There was another of those moments of silence that was almost a
sound in itself.</p>
<p>"As for <i>that</i> suspect," the Defense Professor said softly,
"I think you shall prosecute him on your own, Mr. Potter, without
help from me. I have heard such requests before, and experience
leads me to refuse. Either I will do too good a job of prosecuting
myself, and convince you that I am guilty - or else you will decide
that my prosecution was too half-hearted, and that I am guilty. I
will remark only this in my defense - that I would have needed a
very good reason indeed to jeopardize your fragile alliance with
the heir to House Malfoy."</p>

<p><i>Hypothesis: The Defense Professor</i><br />
<i>(April 8th, 1992, 8:37pm)</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"...so I fear I must take my leave," Dumbledore was saying
gravely. "I promised Quirinus... that is to say, I promised the
Defense Professor... that I would not make any attempt to uncover
his true identity, in my own person or any other."</p>
<p>"And why'd you make a fool promise like that, then?" snapped
Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>"It was an unalterable condition of his employment, or so he
said." Dumbledore glanced at Professor McGonagall, a wry smile
briefly flitting over his face. "And Minerva made it clear to me
that Hogwarts <i>required</i> a competent Defense Professor this
year, even if I had to haul Grindelwald out of Nurmengard and
prevail on old affections to persuade him to take the
position."</p>
<p>"I did not <i>quite</i> phrase it in that fashion -"</p>
<p>"Your expression said it for you, my dear."</p>
<p>And so soon the four of them - Harry, Professor McGonagall, the
Potions Master, and Alastor Moody aka 'Mad-Eye' - were ensconced
all by themselves in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>It was strange how the Headmaster's office seemed...
<i>unbalanced...</i> without the Headmaster in it. If you didn't
have the ancient wizened master to make it all seem <i>solemn</i>,
you were just four people trying to have a serious meeting while
surrounded by bizarre, noisy gidgets. Clearly visible from where
Harry had perched himself on his chair's arm was a
truncated-conical object, like a cone with its top snipped off,
slowly spinning around a pulsating central light which it shaded
but did not obscure; and each time the inner light pulsated, the
assembly made a <i>vroop-vroop-vroop</i> sound that sounded oddly
distant, muffled like it was coming from behind four solid walls,
even though the spinning-conical-section thingy was only a meter or
two away.</p>
<p><i>Vroop... vroop... vroop</i>...</p>
<p>And then there were the various still-breathing bodies of Harry
Potter he'd stashed in one quiet corner, cleaning up a mess that
was his own in more ways than one. (Only one body <i>wasn't</i>
inside a copy of the Invisibility Cloak; but then it merely took a
small effort of concentration for Harry to perceive his other
selves beneath the Cloak of which he was master - an effort which
Harry had carefully <i>not</i> put forth earlier, to avoid getting
advance temporal information he wanted to determine by his own
decision.) The sad thing was that by this point, having his own
body visibly lying in a corner didn't seem all that crazy. It was
just... Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"All right, then," Moody said, looking rather sour about it.
From within his leather armor, the scarred man took out a black
folder. "This is a copy of what Amelia's people put together. She
almost certainly knows we've got it, but it's all off the books,
that clear? Anyway -"</p>
<p>And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement thought 'Quirinus Quirrell' really was. A seemingly
ordinary Hogwarts student (though talented enough that he'd been
only narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy position) who'd gone
vacationing in Albania after his graduation, disappeared, returned
after 25 years, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -</p>
<p>"It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie's name,"
Moody said. "Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with
delusions of grandeur and Bellatrix Black. But after that -" Moody
snorted. "Every fool in the country flocked to serve him. You
would've <i>hoped</i> the Wizengamot would turn serious, once they
realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves. And
that's just what the bastards did - <i>hope</i> that some other
bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to step in
front. It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom. That was
nearly everyone in the Ministry who'd dare say a word that might
give Voldie offense."</p>
<p>"That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,"
injected the solemn voice of Professor McGonagall. "There is an
ancient law that if anyone ends a Most Ancient House, whoever
avenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure, the House of
Potter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours
was titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in
recognition that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of
Monroe."</p>
<p>"Flush of gratitude and all that," Mad-Eye Moody said sourly.
"It didn't last, but at least James and Lily got a fancy title and
a useless medal to take to their graves. But that's leaving out
eight years of complete horror after Monroe disappeared and Regulus
Black - he was Monroe's private source in the Death Eaters, we're
pretty sure - was executed by Voldie. Like a dam breaking and gore
flooding out, drowning the whole country. Albus bloody Dumbledore
himself had to step into Monroe's shoes, and that was barely enough
for us to survive."</p>
<p>Harry listened with an odd sense of unreality. Some of it
<i>felt</i> right, matched up with observation - especially with
the speech Professor Quirrell had made before Christmas - and
yet...</p>
<p>This was <i>Professor Quirrell</i> they were talking about.</p>
<p>"So that's who the Department thinks is your Defense Professor,"
Mad-Eye Moody finished up his account. "Now what do <i>you</i>
think, son?"</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said slowly. <i>It is also possible to have a
mask behind the mask.</i> "The obvious next thought is that this
'David Monroe' person died in the war after all, and this is just
someone else pretending to be David Monroe pretending to be
Quirinus Quirrell."</p>
<p>"That's <i>obvious?</i>" said Professor McGonagall. "Dear
Merlin..."</p>
<p>"Really, boy?" said Mad-Eye Moody, his blue eye spinning
rapidly. "I'd say that's a little... <i>paranoid.</i>"</p>
<p><i>You don't know Professor Quirrell,</i> Harry did not say.
"It's an easy theory to test," Harry said out loud. "Just check
whether the Defense Professor remembers something about the war
that the real David Monroe would've known. Though I suppose, if
he's playing the part of David Monroe <i>pretending</i> to be
someone else, he has a good excuse to <i>pretend</i> he's
pretending he doesn't know what you're talking about -"</p>
<p>"A <i>little</i> paranoid," said the scarred man, his voice
rising. "<i>Not paranoid enough! CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</i> Think
about it, lad - what if the <i>real</i> David Monroe never came
back from Albania?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"I see..." Harry said.</p>
<p>"Of course you do," Professor McGonagall said. "Don't mind me,
please. I'll just sit here quietly going mad."</p>
<p>"In this line of work, if you survive, you learn that there's
three kinds of Dark Wizards," Moody said grimly; his wand wasn't
pointed at anyone, it was angled slightly downward, but it was in
his hand. It had never left his hand since the moment he'd entered
the room. "There's Dark Wizards that have one name. There's Dark
Wizards that have two names. And there's Dark Wizards that change
names like you and I change clothes. I saw 'Monroe' go through
three Death Eaters like he was snapping twigs. There's not many
wizards that good at age forty-five. Dumbledore, maybe, but not
many others."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is true," said the Potions Master from where he
was lurking. "But what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity,
Monroe was surely the Dark Lord's enemy. I've heard Death Eaters
curse his name even after they thought him dead. They feared him
well."</p>
<p>"So far as Defense Professors are concerned," Professor
McGonagall said primly, "I shall take it and be grateful."</p>
<p>Moody swung around to glare at her. "Just where the devil was
'Monroe' all those years he was gone, eh? Maybe he thought he could
make a name for himself in Britain by opposing Voldie, and vanished
away when he found out he was wrong. Then why'd he come back
<i>now,</i> hah? What's his <i>new</i> plan?"</p>
<p>"He, ah..." Harry ventured tentatively. "He <i>says</i> he
always wanted to be a great Defense Professor because all the best
fighting wizards have taught at Hogwarts. And he kind of <i>is</i>
being an incredibly good Defense Professor, actually... I mean, if
he just wanted to keep up a disguise, he could get away with
<i>much</i> sloppier work..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was nodding firmly.</p>
<p>"Naive," Moody said flatly. "I suppose you all haven't wondered
if your Defense Professor set up the whole House of Monroe to be
wiped out?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" cried Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Our mystery wizard hears about a missing kid from a Most
Ancient House of Britain," Moody said. "Steps into the shoes of
'David Monroe', but stays away from the real Monroe family. But
eventually the House is bound to notice something wrong. So this
imposter somehow prods Voldie into wiping them all out - maybe
leaked a password they'd given him for their wards - and then he
was a Lord of the Wizengamot!"</p>
<p>There seemed to be a fight going on inside Harry's mind between
Hufflepuff One, who'd never trusted the Defense Professor in the
first place; and Hufflepuff Two, who was far too loyal to Harry's
friend, Professor Quirrell, to believe something like that just
because Moody said so.</p>
<p><i>It</i> is <i>kind of obvious, though,</i> observed his
Slytherin part. <i>I mean, do you actually believe that under
natural circumstances, anyone would end up as the last heir to a
Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family AND he has
to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I'd say he went too
far over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal
literary hero. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real
life.</i></p>
<p><i>This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his
heritage,</i> commented Harry's Inner Critic. <i>With a prophecy
about him. You know, I don't think we've ever read a story about
two equally destined heroes competing to see who's cliched enough
to take down the villain -</i></p>
<p><i>Yes,</i> replied the central Harry over the distant vroop-ing
noise in the background, <i>it's a very sad life we lead and YOU'RE
NOT HELPING.</i></p>
<p><i>There's only one thing to do at this point,</i> said
Ravenclaw. <i>And we all know what it is, so why argue?</i></p>
<p><i>But,</i> Harry replied, <i>how</i> do <i>we test
experimentally whether or not Professor Quirrell is the original
David Monroe? I mean, what sort of observable behaves differently,
depending on whether he's the real David Monroe or an
impostor?</i></p>
<p>"What do you want me to do about it, Mad-Eye?" Professor
McGonagall was demanding. "I can't -"</p>
<p>"You can," the scarred man said, glaring at her fiercely. "Just
fire the bloody Defense Professor."</p>
<p>"You say that <i>every</i> year," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm always right!"</p>
<p>"Constant vigilance or no, Alastor, the students must be
taught!"</p>
<p>Moody snorted. "Pfah! I swear the curse gets worse every year,
as you lot get more and more reluctant to let them go. Your
precious Professor Quirrell would have to <i>be</i> Grindelwald in
disguise, to get himself sent off!"</p>
<p>"Is he?" Harry couldn't help asking. "I mean, could he
<i>actually</i> be -"</p>
<p>"I check Grindie's cell every two months," Moody said. "He was
there in March."</p>
<p>"Could the person in the cell be a ringer?"</p>
<p>"I administer a blood test for his identity, son."</p>
<p>"Where do you keep the blood you use as a reference?"</p>
<p>"In a safe place." Something like a smile was stretching the
scarred lips. "Have you considered the Auror Office after you
graduate?"</p>
<p>"Alastor," Professor McGonagall said reluctantly. "The Defense
Professor <i>does</i> have a... health condition. I suppose you
will call it suspicious in itself - but it is by no means certain
that it will be any ill-doing on his part which prevents us from
renewing his employment."</p>
<p>"Yes, his little naptimes," Moody said darkly. "Amelia thinks he
stepped into the path of a high-level curse. Sounds to <i>me</i>
more like a Dark ritual gone wrong!"</p>
<p>"You've no proof of that!" Professor McGonagall said.</p>
<p>"That man might as well be wearing a sign saying 'Dark Wizard'
in glowing green letters over his head."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. It didn't seem like an especially good time
to ask what Mr. Moody thought of the 'not all sacrificial rituals
are evil' standpoint. "Excuse me, but you said earlier that
Professor Quirrell - I mean the old David Monroe - I mean the
Monroe from the seventies - anyway, you said that person used the
Killing Curse. What does that imply? Does somebody have to be a
Dark Wizard to use it?"</p>
<p>Moody shook his head. "I've used it myself. All it takes is
power and a certain <i>mood.</i>" The grimacing lips were showing
teeth. "The first time I cast it was against a wizard named Gerald
Grice, and you can ask me what <i>he</i> did after you graduate
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"But why is it Unforgiveable, then?" Harry said. "I mean, a
Cutting Hex can kill someone too. So why's it any better to use a
Reducto instead of Avada Kedav-"</p>
<p>"Shut your mouth!" Moody said sharply. "Someone might take it
the wrong way, your saying that incantation. You <i>look</i> too
young to cast it, but there's such a thing as Polyjuice. And to
answer your question, boy, there's two reasons why that spell's in
the blackest book. The first is that the Killing Curse strikes
directly at the soul, and it'll just keep going until it hits one.
Straight through shields. Straight through <i>walls.</i> There's a
<i>reason</i> why even Aurors fighting Death Eaters weren't allowed
to use it before the Monroe Act."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Harry. "That does seem like an excellent reason to
ban -"</p>
<p>"I'm not finished, son. The second reason is that the Killing
Curse doesn't <i>just</i> take a powerful bit of magic. You've got
to <i>mean</i> it. You've got to <i>want</i> someone dead, and not
for the greater good, either. Killing Grice didn't bring back Blair
Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David Capito. It wasn't for justice,
or to stop him doing it again. <i>I wanted him dead.</i> You
understand now, lad? You don't have to be a Dark Wizard to use that
spell - but you can't be Albus Dumbledore, either. And if you're
arrested for killing with it, there's no possible defense."</p>
<p>"I... see," murmured the Boy-Who-Lived. <i>You can't want the
person dead as an instrumental value on the way to some positive
future consequence, you can't cast it if you believe it's a
necessary evil, you have to actually want them dead for the sake of
being dead, as a terminal value in your utility function.</i> "A
magically embodied preference for death over life, striking within
the plane of pure life force... that does sound like a difficult
spell to block."</p>
<p>"Not difficult," Moody snapped. "<i>Impossible</i>."</p>
<p>Harry nodded gravely. "But David Monroe - or whoever - used the
Killing Curse against a couple of Death Eaters even <i>before</i>
they wiped out his family. Does that mean he already had to hate
them? Like, the martial arts story was probably true?"</p>
<p>Moody shook his head slightly. "One of the dark truths of the
Killing Curse, son, is that once you've cast it the first time, it
doesn't take much hate to do it again."</p>
<p>"It damages the mind?"</p>
<p>Again Moody shook his head. "No. It's the killing that does
that. Murder tears the soul - but that's just the same if it's a
Cutting Hex. The Killing Curse doesn't crack your soul. It just
takes a cracked soul to cast." If there was a sad expression on the
scarred face, it could not be read. "But that doesn't tell us much
about Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who'll never be able to cast
the Curse all their lives, because they never crack no matter what
- they're the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little
cracking."</p>
<p>There was a strange heavy feeling in Harry's chest. He'd
wondered what exactly it had meant, that Lily Potter had tried to
cast the Killing Curse at Lord Voldemort with her last breath. But
surely it was forgiveable, it was <i>right</i> and <i>proper</i>
for a mother to hate the Dark Wizard who was coming to kill her
baby, mocking her for how she couldn't stop him. There was
something wrong with you as a parent if you <i>couldn't</i> cast
Avada Kedavra, in that situation. And no other spell could've gone
past the Dark Lord's shields; you'd have to at least <i>try</i> to
hate the Dark Lord enough to want him dead for the sake of dead, if
that was the only way to save your baby.</p>
<p><i>It only takes a little cracking...</i></p>
<p>"Enough," said Professor McGonagall. "What would you have us
do?"</p>
<p>Moody's smile twisted. "Get rid of the Defense Professor and see
if all your troubles mysteriously clear up. Bet you a Galleon they
do."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked like she was in pain. "Alastor - but
- will <i>you</i> teach the classes, if -"</p>
<p>"Ha!" said Moody. "If I ever say yes to that question, check me
for Polyjuice, because it's not me."</p>
<p>"I'll test it experimentally," Harry said. And then, as everyone
looked at him, "I'll ask Professor Quirrell a question that the
real David Monroe would know - like who else was in the Slytherin
class of 1945, or something like that - hopefully without making it
obvious. It won't be definitive proof, he could've studied the
role, but it would be evidence. Still, Mr. Moody, even if Professor
Quirrell isn't the original Monroe, I'm not sure that getting rid
of him is a free action. He saved my life twice -"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" demanded Moody. "When? How?"</p>
<p>"Once when he knocked down a bunch of witches who were summoning
me toward the ground, once when he figured out that the Dementor
was draining me through my wand. And if Professor Quirrell
<i>wasn't</i> the one who set up Draco Malfoy in the first place,
then he saved Draco Malfoy's life, and things would be a lot worse
if he hadn't. If the Defense Professor <i>isn't</i> behind it all -
he's not someone we can afford to just get rid of."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded firmly.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Hypothesis: Severus Snape</i><i><br /></i><i>(April 8th,
1992, 9:03pm)</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turning
stairs, turning without descending; or at least <i>one</i> Harry
stood upon those stairs - his other three selves had been left
behind in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you a private question?" Harry said, when he thought
they were far enough away not to be heard. "And in particular,
private from the Headmaster."</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. "Though I
hope you realize that I cannot <i>do</i> anything which conflicts
with my duties to -"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "that's exactly what I need to ask you about.
In front of the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that
Hermione was no part of House Potter and that he wouldn't take the
money, you told Hermione how to swear that oath. I want to know, if
something like that comes up again, if your first duty is to the
Hogwarts student Hermione Granger, or to the head of the Order of
the Phoenix, Albus Dumbledore."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the face
with a cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she'd
been told that somebody was about to do it again, and not to
flinch.</p>
<p>Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he
needed to pick up the knack of <i>not</i> phrasing things to hit as
hard as he possibly could.</p>
<p>The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they
descended.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said with a low
exhalation. "I... <i>wish</i> you wouldn't ask me such questions...
oh, Harry, I wasn't thinking then, not at all. I only saw a chance
to help Miss Granger and... I <i>was</i> Sorted into Gryffindor,
after all."</p>
<p>"You've got a chance to think now," Harry said. It was all
coming out wrong, but he had to say it <i>anyway,</i> because -
"I'm not asking you to be loyal to <i>me.</i> But if you do know -
if you <i>are</i> sure - what you'll do if it comes down to an
innocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the Phoenix a second
time..."</p>
<p>But Professor McGonagall shook her head. "I'm <i>not</i> sure,"
the Transfiguration Professor whispered. "I don't know if it was
the right choice even then. I'm sorry. I can't decide such awful
things!"</p>
<p>"But you'll do <i>something</i> if it happens again," Harry
said. "Indecision is also a choice. You can't just <i>imagine</i>
having to make an immediate decision?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; and
Harry realized that he'd accidentally offered a way out. The
Professor's next words confirmed Harry's fears. "Such a dreadful
choice as that, Mr. Potter - I think I should not make it until I
must."</p>
<p>Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to
expect Professor McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral
dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice
would <i>feel</i> bad either way, so you could temporarily save
yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of
not being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost of
incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late...
but you couldn't expect a witch to know all that. "All right,"
Harry said.</p>
<p>Though it wasn't right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want
that debt removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of
that debt. And if the Defense Professor <i>was</i> David Monroe, or
could convincingly <i>appear</i> to be David Monroe, then Lord
Voldemort technically hadn't <i>exterminated</i> the House of
Monroe. In which case somebody might be able to pass a Wizengamot
resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter, which had
been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.</p>
<p>In which case Hermione's vow of service to a Noble House might
be null and void.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Harry didn't know anything about the legalities,
especially not whether House Potter got the money <i>back</i> if
someone managed to send Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost
something might not mean the payment was returned, legally
speaking. Harry wasn't sure and he didn't dare ask a magical
solicitor...</p>
<p>...it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one
adult to take Hermione's side instead of Dumbledore's, if an issue
like that threatened to come up.</p>
<p>The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before
the backs of the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside,
revealing the hallway.</p>
<p>Harry stepped out -</p>
<p>A hand caught at Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, "why did
you to tell me to keep watch over Professor Snape?"</p>
<p>Harry turned around again.</p>
<p>"You told me to keep watch, and see if he'd changed," Professor
McGonagall went on, her tone urgent. "<i>Why</i> did you say that,
Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and
remember why he <i>had</i> said that. Harry and Neville had rescued
Lesath Lestrange from bullies, and then Harry had confronted
Severus in the hallway and, at least according to the Potions
Master's own words, 'almost died' -</p>
<p>"I learned something that made me worry," Harry said after a
moment. "From someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else."
Severus had made Harry swear that their conversations wouldn't be
shared with anyone, and Harry was still bound by it.</p>
<p>"<i>Mr.</i> Potter -" began Professor McGonagall, and then
exhaled, the flash of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had
come. "Never mind. If you cannot say, you cannot say."</p>
<p>"Why do <i>you</i> ask?" Harry said.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate -</p>
<p>"All right, let me be more specific," Harry said. After
Professor Quirrell had done it to <i>him</i> several times, Harry
was starting to get the hang of it. "What change have you
<i>already</i> observed in Professor Snape that you're trying to
decide whether to tell me about?"</p>
<p>"Harry -" the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed
her mouth.</p>
<p>"I obviously know <i>something</i> you don't," Harry said
helpfully. "See, this is why we can't always put off trying to
decide our awful moral dilemmas."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath,
pinched the bridge of her nose and squeezed it several times. "All
right," she said. "It's a subtle thing... but worrying. How can I
put this... Mr. Potter, have you read many books that young
children are not meant to read?"</p>
<p>"I've read <i>all</i> of them."</p>
<p>"Of course you have. Well... I don't quite understand it myself,
but for so long as Severus has been employed in this school,
stalking about in that awful stained cloak, there has been a
<i>certain sort of girl</i> that stares at him with longing eyes
-"</p>
<p>"You say that like it's a bad thing?" Harry said. "I mean, if
there's one thing I <i>did</i> understand from those books, it's
that you're not supposed to question people's preferences."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gave Harry a <i>very</i> strange look.</p>
<p>"I mean," Harry said again, "from what I've read, when I'm a bit
older there's something like a 10% chance that <i>I'll</i> find
Professor Snape attractive, and the important thing is for me to
just accept whatever I -"</p>
<p>"<i>In any case, Mr. Potter,</i> Severus has always been
entirely indifferent to the stares of those young girls. But now -"
Professor McGonagall seemed to realize something, and hastily said,
her hands rising in warding, "Please don't mistake me, Professor
Snape <i>certainly</i> has not taken advantage of any young
witches! Absolutely not! He has never even so much as smiled at
one, not that I ever heard. He has told the young girls to stop
gaping at him. And if they stare at him regardless, he looks away.
That I have seen with my own eyes."</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. "Sorry, but just because I've <i>read</i>
those books doesn't mean I understood them. What does all that
<i>mean?</i>"</p>
<p>"That he is <i>noticing</i>," Professor McGonagall said in a low
voice. "It is a subtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am
certain. And <i>that</i> means... I am very much afraid... that the
bond which held Severus to Albus's cause... may have weakened, or
even broken."</p>
<p>2 + 2 = ...</p>
<p><i>"Snape and Dumbledore?</i>" Then Harry heard the words that
had just come out of his mouth, and hastily added, "Not that
there's anything wrong with that -"</p>
<p><i>"No!"</i> said Professor McGonagall. "Oh, for pity's sake - I
can't explain it to you, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>The other shoe finally dropped.</p>
<p><i>He was</i> still <i>in love with my mother?</i></p>
<p>This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, for
around five seconds before the <i>third</i> shoe dropped.</p>
<p><i>Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful relationship
advice.</i></p>
<p>"I see," Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were
times when saying 'Oops' didn't fully cover it. "You're right,
that's not a good sign."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. "Whatever
you're thinking right now," she said in a slightly muffled voice,
"which I assure you is <i>also</i> wrong, I don't want to hear
about it, ever."</p>
<p>"So..." Harry said. "If, like you said, the bond that held
Professor Snape to the Headmaster <i>has</i> broken... what would
he do then?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>What would he do then?</i></p>
<p>Minerva lowered her hands, gazing down at the upturned face of
the Boy-Who-Lived. One simple question shouldn't have caused her so
much dismay. She'd known Severus for years; the two of them bound,
in some strange way, by the prophecy they'd both heard. Though
Minerva suspected, from what she knew of the rules of prophecy,
that she had only <i>overheard</i> it herself. It had been
Severus's acts which had brought about the prophecy's fulfillment.
And the guilt, the heartbreak which had come of that choice, had
been tormenting the Potions Master for years. She couldn't imagine
who Severus would be without it. Her mind went blank, trying to
imagine; her thoughts an empty parchment.</p>
<p><i>Surely</i> Severus was no longer the man he'd once been, that
angry and terribly foolish young man who'd brought the prophecy
before Voldemort in exchange for being admitted into the Death
Eaters. She'd known him for years, and surely Severus was no longer
that man...</p>
<p>Did she really know him at all?</p>
<p>Had <i>anyone</i> ever seen the real Severus Snape?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"I don't know," Professor McGonagall finally said. "I truly
don't know at all. I can't even imagine. Do <i>you</i> know
anything of this, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Er..." Harry said. "I think I can say that my own evidence
points in the same direction as yours. I mean, it increases the
probability that Professor Snape isn't in love with my mother
anymore."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. "I give up."</p>
<p>"I don't know of anything wrong he's done apart from that,
though," Harry added. "I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask
me about this?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall.
"Please don't, Harry."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the
hallways, hearing Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after,
and the rumbling sound of the gargoyles moving into place.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was the morning after next, during Potions class, that
Harry's <i>potion of cold resistance</i> boiled over his cauldron
with a green froth and mildly nauseating smell, and Professor
Snape, looking more resigned than disgusted, told Harry to stay
after class. Harry had his own suspicions about this affair, and as
soon as class let out - Hermione, as usual for the last few days,
being the first to flee out the door - the door swung shot and
locked behind the departing students.</p>
<p>"I apologize for ruining your potion, Mr. Potter," Severus Snape
said quietly. There was upon his face the strange sad look that
Harry had seen only once before, in a hallway some time ago. "It
will not be reflected in your grades. Please, sit down."</p>
<p>Harry sat back down at his desk, filling up the time by
scrubbing a bit more at the green stain on the wooden surface, as
the Potions Master incanted a few privacy spells.</p>
<p>When the Potions Master was done, he spoke again. "I... do not
know how to broach this topic, Mr. Potter, so I will simply say
it... before the Dementor, you recovered your memory of the night
your parents died?"</p>
<p>Harry silently nodded.</p>
<p>"If... I know it must not be a pleasant memory, but... if you
could tell me what happened...?"</p>
<p>"Why?" Harry said. His voice was solemn, definitely <i>not
mocking</i> the pleading look that Harry had never expected to see
from that person. "I wouldn't think that would be a pleasant thing
for you to hear either, Professor -"</p>
<p>The Potions Master's voice was almost a whisper. "I have
imagined it every night these last ten years."</p>
<p><i>You know,</i> said Harry's Slytherin side, <i>it might not be
such a good idea to give him closure, if his guilt-based loyalties
are already wavering -</i></p>
<p><i>Shut up. Overruled.</i></p>
<p>It wasn't something that Harry could <i>actually</i> bring
himself to deny. He took one suggestion from his Slytherin side,
and that was it.</p>
<p>"Will you tell me <i>exactly</i> how you came to learn about the
Prophecy?" Harry said. "I'm sorry to make this a trade, I
<i>will</i> tell you afterward, only, it could be really important
-"</p>
<p>"There is little to say. I had come to be interviewed by the
Deputy Headmistress for the position of Potions Master, and so I
was waiting outside the room of the Hog's Head Inn when the
applicant before me, Sybill Trelawney, came to seek the position of
Professor of Divination. As soon as Trelawney finished speaking her
words, I fled, forsaking my chance at Hogwarts's Mastery, and went
to the Dark Lord." The Potions Master's face was drawn and tight.
"I did not even pause to consider why that riddle might have come
to me, before I sold it to another."</p>
<p>"A <i>job interview?</i>" Harry said. "Where you and Professor
Trelawney both happened to be applying, and Professor McGonagall
was interviewing? That seems... like rather a large
coincidence..."</p>
<p>"Seers are the pawns of time, Mr. Potter. Coincidence is beneath
them, and they are above it. I was the one meant to hear that
prophecy and become its fool. Minerva's presence made no final
difference to how it came about. There was no Memory Charm as you
supposed, I do not know why you thought that, but there was no
Memory-Charm, there could have been no Memory-Charm. The voice of a
seer has a quality, an enigma which even Legilimency cannot share,
how could that be imbued in a false memory? Do you think the Dark
Lord would believe my mere words? The Dark Lord seized my mind and
saw the mystification there, even if he could not seize the
mystery, and so he knew the prophecy had been true. The Dark Lord
could have killed me then, having taken what he wanted - I was a
fool indeed to go to him - but he saw something in me I do not
know, and took me into the Death Eaters, though on his terms rather
than mine. That is how I brought it about, brought it all about,
from beginning to end, always my own doing." Severus's voice had
gone rather hoarse, and his face was filled with naked pain. "Now
tell me, please, how did Lily die?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed twice, and began his recounting.</p>
<p>"James Potter shouted for Lily to run away with me, that he
would hold off You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>"You-Know-Who said -" Harry stopped, the chills going all over
his own skin, his own muscles tightening as if in preparing for a
seizure. The memory was returning strongly, now, accompanied by
cold and darkness in association. "He used... the Killing Curse...
and then he came upstairs somehow, I think he must have flown, I
don't remember any footsteps on stairs or anything like that... and
then my mother said, 'No, not Harry, please not Harry!' or
something like that. And the Dark Lord - his voice was so high,
like water whistling out of a teakettle only <i>cold</i> - the Dark
Lord said -"</p>
<p><i>Stand aside, woman! For you I am not come, only the
boy.</i></p>
<p>The words were very clear in Harry's memory.</p>
<p>"- he told my mother to get out of his way, that he was only
there for <i>me</i>, and my mother begged him to have mercy, and
the Dark Lord said -"</p>
<p><i>I give you this rare chance to flee.</i></p>
<p>"- that he was being generous and giving her a chance to run,
but he wouldn't bother fighting her, and even if she died, she
couldn't save me -" Harry's voice was unsteady, "- and so she ought
to get out of his way. And that was when my mother begged the Dark
Lord to take her life instead of mine - and the Dark Lord - the
Dark Lord said to her - and his voice was lower this time, like he
was dropping a pose -"</p>
<p><i>Very well, I accept the bargain.</i></p>
<p>"- he said that he accepted her offer, and that she should drop
her wand so he could kill her. And then the Dark Lord waited, just
waited. I, I don't know what Lily Potter was thinking, it hadn't
even made sense in the first place, what she said, it wasn't like
the Dark Lord would kill her and then just <i>leave,</i> when he'd
come there for me. Lily Potter didn't say anything, and then the
Dark Lord started laughing at her and it was horrible and - and she
finally tried the only thing left that wasn't abandoning me or just
giving up and dying. I don't know if she even could've, if the
spell would've worked for her, but when you think about, she had to
try. The last thing my mother said was 'Avada Ke-' but the Dark
Lord started his own curse as soon as she said 'Av' and he said it
in less than half a second and there was a flash of green light and
then - and then - <i>and then</i> -"</p>
<p>"That's enough."</p>
<p>Slowly, like a body floating to the surface of water, Harry
returned from wherever he'd been.</p>
<p>"That's enough," the Potions Master said hoarsely. "She died...
Lily died without pain, then? The Dark Lord... did not do anything
to her, before she died?"</p>
<p><i>She died thinking that she'd failed, and that the Dark Lord
was going to kill her baby next. That's pain.</i></p>
<p>"He - the Dark Lord didn't torture her -" Harry said. "If that's
what you're asking."</p>
<p>Behind Harry, the door unlocked itself and swung open.</p>
<p>Harry left.</p>
<p>It was Friday, April 10th, of 1992.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="87">Chapter 87</h2><h3>Hedonic Awareness</h3>
<p><i>Thursday, April 16th, 1992.</i></p>
<p>The school was almost deserted now, nine-tenths of the students
having gone home for the Easter holiday, just about everyone she
knew missing. Susan had stayed behind, her grand-aunt being quite
busy, as had Ron for reasons she didn't know - maybe the Weasley
family was poor enough that feeding all the children for an extra
week would've been a noticeable strain? It all worked out well
enough, since Ron and Susan were just about the only ones left
who'd still talk to her. (At least that she wanted to talk back
<i>to.</i> Lavender was still nice to her, and Tracey was, um,
Tracey, but neither of them were quite <i>relaxing</i> to spend a
free hour around; and in any case, neither of those two had stayed
over for the Easter hols.)</p>
<p>If she couldn't go <i>home</i> - and she wasn't allowed to go
home, her parents had been lied-to and told she'd had Glowpox -
then an almost-empty Hogwarts was the next best thing.</p>
<p>She could even visit the library without people staring at her,
since there were no lessons and nobody was trying to do
schoolwork.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to think that Hermione drooped about the
corridors weeping all day long. Oh, she'd cried a lot the first two
days, of course, but two days had been enough. There were parts of
Harry's borrowed books about that, how even people who were
paralyzed in car accidents weren't nearly as unhappy as they'd
expected to be, six months later, just like lottery winners weren't
nearly as happy as they'd expected. People adjusted, their
happiness levels went back to their happiness set point, life went
on.</p>
<p>A shadow fell over where Hermione was reading her current book
and she whirled around, the wand hidden on her lap coming up to
point directly at the surprised face of -</p>
<p>"Sorry!" Harry Potter said, hastily holding up his palms to show
his left hand empty, and his right hand holding a small red-velvet
pouch. "Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you."</p>
<p>There was an awful silence, her heartbeat increasing and her
palms starting to sweat as Harry Potter just looked at her. She'd
<i>almost</i> talked to him, on the first morning of the rest of
her life; but when she'd come down to breakfast Harry Potter had
looked so <i>awful</i> - so she hadn't sat down beside him at the
breakfast-table, just quietly eaten in her own little bubble of
nobody else sitting next to her, and it had been horrible, but
Harry hadn't come to her, and... she just hadn't talked to him,
since then. (It wasn't hard to avoid everyone, if you stayed out of
the Ravenclaw common room, and ran out of classes before anyone
could talk to you.)</p>
<p>And ever since she'd been wondering what Harry thought of her
now - if he hated her for having lost all his money - or if he
really <i>was</i> in love with her and that's why he'd done it - or
if he'd given up on her keeping pace with him because <i>she</i>
couldn't <i>frighten Dementors</i> - she couldn't face him now, she
just couldn't, she spent sleepless nights worrying what Harry
thought of her now, and she was afraid, and she'd been avoiding the
boy who'd spent all his money to save her, and she was a horrible
ungrateful wretch, and a terrible person and -</p>
<p>Then her eyes glanced down to see that Harry was reaching into
the red-velvet pouch and taking out a heart-shaped red-foil-wrapped
sweet, and her brain melted down like chocolate left out in the
sun.</p>
<p>"I was going to give you more space," said Harry Potter, "only I
was reading up on Critch's theories about hedonics and how to train
your inner pigeon and how small immediate positive and negative
feedbacks secretly control most of what we actually do, and it
occurred to me that you might be avoiding me because seeing me made
you think of things that felt like negative associations, and I
really <i>didn't</i> want to let that run any longer without doing
something about it, so I got ahold of a bag of chocolates from the
Weasley twins and I'm just going to give you one every time you see
me as a positive reinforcement if that's all right with you -"</p>
<p>"<i>Breathe</i>, Harry," Hermione said without thinking about
it.</p>
<p>It was the first word she'd spoken to him since the day of the
trial.</p>
<p>The two of them stared at each other.</p>
<p>The books stared at them from the surrounding shelves.</p>
<p>They stared some more at each other.</p>
<p>"You're supposed to eat the chocolate," Harry said, holding out
the heart-shaped sweet like a Valentine. "Unless just being given a
chocolate feels good enough to count as a positive reinforcement,
in which case you probably need to put it in your pocket or
something."</p>
<p>She knew that if she tried speaking again she'd fail, so she
didn't try.</p>
<p>Harry's head slumped a bit. "<i>Do</i> you hate me now?"</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" she said. "No, you shouldn't think that, Harry!
Just - just - just <i>everything!</i>" She realized that her wand
was still pointed at Harry, and she lowered it. She was trying very
hard not to burst out into tears. "<i>Everything!</i>" she
repeated, and couldn't find any better to say than that, although
she was certain that Harry wanted to tell her to be specific.</p>
<p>"I think I understand," Harry said cautiously. "What're you
reading?"</p>
<p>Before she could stop him, them, Harry bent over the
library-desk to see the book she was reading, leaning his head
forward before she could think to grab the book away -</p>
<p>Harry stared at the open page.</p>
<p>"The World's Wealthiest Wizards and How They Got That Way,"
Harry read off the book's title from the top. "Number sixty-five,
Sir Gareth, owner of a transportation company that won the
19th-century shipping wars... monopoly on oh-tee-threes... I
see."</p>
<p>"I s'pose you're going to tell me that I don't need to worry
about anything and you'll take care of it all?" It came out
sounding harsher than she would've wanted, and she felt another
stab of guilt for being such a terrible person.</p>
<p>"Nah," Harry said, sounding oddly cheerful. "I can put myself in
your shoes well enough to know that if <i>you</i> paid a bunch of
money to save <i>me, I'd</i> be trying to pay it back. I'd know it
was silly on some level, and I'd <i>still</i> be trying to pay it
back all by myself. There's no way I wouldn't understand
<i>that</i>, Hermione."</p>
<p>Hermione's face screwed up and she felt moisture in the corners
of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Fair warning, though," Harry went on, "I might solve the debt
to Lucius Malfoy myself if I see a way before you do, it's more
important to get that sorted immediately than <i>which</i> one of
us gets it sorted. Anything interesting so far?"</p>
<p>Three-quarters of her was running in circles and smashing into
trees as she tried to figure out the implications of everything
Harry had just said (<i>did</i> he still respect her as a heroine?
or did that mean he thought she <i>couldn't</i> do it on her own?)
and meanwhile a much more sensible part of Hermione flipped back
the book to page 37 which had the most promising entry she'd seen
so far (though in her imagination she always did it on her own and
took Harry completely by surprise) -</p>
<p>"I thought this seemed quite interesting," her voice said.</p>
<p>"Number fourteen, 'Crozier', true name unknown," Harry read.
"Wow, that is... that is the gaudiest checkered top hat I've ever
seen. Wealth, at least six hundred thousand Galleons... so around
thirty million pounds, not enough to make a Muggle famous, but good
enough for the smaller wizard population, I guess. Rumored to be a
modern alias of the six-century-old Nicholas Flamel, the only known
wizard to succeed at the incredibly difficult alchemical procedure
for creating the Philosopher's Stone, which enables the
transmutation of base metals into gold or silver as well as... the
Elixir of Life which indefinitely prolongs the youth and health of
the user... Um, Hermione, this seems obviously false."</p>
<p>"I've read more references to Nicholas Flamel," Hermione said.
"<i>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</i> says he secretly trained
Dumbledore to stand up to Grindelwald. There's a lot of books that
take the story seriously, not just this one... you think it's too
good to be true?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not," said Harry. Harry pulled out the chair next
to her own, at the small table, and sat down beside her in his
accustomed place on her right, just like he'd never left; she had
to choke back a catch in her throat. "The idea of 'too good to be
true' isn't causal reasoning, the universe doesn't check if the
output of the equations is 'too good' or 'too bad' before allowing
it. People used to think that airplanes and smallpox vaccines were
too good to be true. Muggles have figured out ways to travel to
other stars without even using magic, and you and I can use our
wands to do things that Muggle physicists think are literally
impossible. I can't even imagine what we could rule out the
<i>real</i> laws of magic being able to do."</p>
<p>"So what's the problem, then?" Hermione said. Her voice sounded
more normal now, in her own ears.</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. The boy reached over her own outstretched
arm, his robes brushing hers, and tapped the artist's illustration
of an ominously glowing red stone dripping scarlet liquid. "Problem
one is that there's no logical reason why the <i>same</i> artifact
would be able to transmute lead to gold <i>and</i> produce an
elixir that kept someone young. I wonder if there's an official
name for that in the literature? Like the 'turned up to eleven
effect', maybe? If everyone can see a flower, you can't get away
with saying flowers are the size of houses. But if you're in a
flying saucer cult, since nobody can see the alien mothership
anyway, you can say it's the size of a city, or the size of the
Moon. Observable things have to be constrained by evidence, but
when somebody makes up a story, they can make the story as extreme
as they want. So the Philosopher's Stone gives you unlimited gold
<i>and</i> eternal life, not because there's a single magical
discovery that would produce both of those effects, but because
someone made up a story about a super happy thingy."</p>
<p>"Harry, there's a lot of things in magic that aren't sensible,"
she said.</p>
<p>"Granted," said Harry. "But Hermione, problem two is that not
even <i>wizards</i> are crazy enough to casually overlook the
implications of <i>this</i>. <i>Everyone</i> would be trying to
rediscover the formula for the Philosopher's Stone, whole
<i>countries</i> would be trying to capture the immortal wizard and
get the secret out of him -"</p>
<p>"It's not a <i>secret.</i>" Hermione flipped the page, showing
Harry the diagrams. "The instructions are right on the next page.
It's just so difficult that only Nicholas Flamel's <i>done</i>
it."</p>
<p>"So entire countries would be trying to kidnap Flamel and force
<i>him</i> to make more Stones. Come on, Hermione, even wizards
wouldn't hear about <i>immortality</i> and, and," Harry Potter
paused, his eloquence apparently failing him, "and <i>just keep
going.</i> Humans are crazy, but they're not <i>that</i>
crazy!"</p>
<p>"Not everyone thinks the same way <i>you</i> do, Harry." He did
have a point, but... <i>how</i> many different references had she
come across to Nicholas Flamel? Besides <i>World's Wealthiest
Wizards</i> and <i>Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts,</i> there'd also
been <i>Stories of Moderately Ancient Times</i> and <i>Biographies
of the Justly Famous...</i></p>
<p>"All right then, <i>Professor Quirrell</i> would've kidnapped
this Flamel guy. It's what an evil person <i>or</i> a good person
or just a <i>selfish</i> person would do if they had any sense. The
Defense Professor knows a lot of secrets and he wouldn't miss
<i>that</i> one." Harry sighed and looked up; she followed his
gaze, but he was apparently just looking at the larger library, the
rows and rows and rows of bookcases. "I don't mean to mess with
your project," said Harry, "and I certainly don't mean to
discourage you, but... Honestly, Hermione, I'm not sure you're
going to find any good ideas for making money in a book like this.
Like the old joke about how if an economist sees a twenty-pound
note lying in the street, they won't bother picking it up, because
if it were real, someone else would've picked it up already. Any
way of making lots of money that everyone <i>knows</i> about to the
point where it's in books like this... you see what I'm saying? It
can't be possible for everyone to make a thousand Galleons a month
in three easy steps, or everyone would be doing it."</p>
<p>"So? That wouldn't stop <i>you,</i>" Hermione said, her voice
now roughening again. "You do impossible things all the time, I bet
you've done something impossible in the last <i>week</i> and you
didn't bother <i>telling</i> anyone."</p>
<p>(There was a slight pause, which, if Miss Granger had known, was
exactly the length of pause you'd make if you'd fought Mad-Eye
Moody and won exactly eight days earlier.)</p>
<p>"Not in the last seven days, no," Harry said. "Look... part of
the trick of doing the impossible is being selective about
<i>which</i> impossibilities you challenge, and only trying when
you have a special advantage. If there's a money-making method in
this book that sounds difficult for a wizard, but it's easy if we
can use Dad's old Mac Plus, <i>then</i> we'd have a plan."</p>
<p>"I <i>know that,</i> Harry," Hermione said, her voice wavering
only slightly. "I was looking to see if there was anything here I
<i>could</i> figure out how to do. I thought, maybe the difficult
part about making a Philosopher's Stone was that the alchemical
circle had to be super precise, and I could get it right by using a
Muggle microscope -"</p>
<p>"That's <i>brilliant,</i> Hermione!" The boy rapidly drew his
wand, said "<i>Quietus,</i>" and then continued after the small
noises of the rowdier books had died down. "Even if the
Philosopher's Stone is just a myth, the same trick might work for
other difficult alchemies -"</p>
<p>"Well, it <i>can't</i> work," Hermione said. She'd flown across
the library to look up the only book on alchemy that wasn't in the
Restricted Section. And then - she remembered the crushing letdown,
all the sudden hope dissipating like mist. "Because <i>all</i>
alchemical circles have to be drawn 'to the fineness of a child's
hair', it isn't any finer for some alchemies than others. And
wizards <i>have</i> Omnioculars, and I haven't heard of any spells
where you use Omnioculars to magnify things and do them exactly. I
should've realized that!"</p>
<p>"Hermione," Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into
the red-velvet pouch again, "don't punish yourself when a bright
idea doesn't work out. You've got to go through a <i>lot</i> of
flawed ideas to find one that might work. And if you send your
brain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a flawed
idea, instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by
your brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won't think of any
ideas at all." Harry put down two heart-shaped chocolates beside
the book. "Here, have another chocolate. Besides the one from
earlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your brain for generating
a good candidate strategy."</p>
<p>"I suppose you're right," Hermione said in a small voice, but
she didn't touch the chocolate. She started to turn the pages back
to 167, where she'd been reading before Harry had come in.</p>
<p>(Hermione Granger did not require <i>bookmarks,</i> of
course.)</p>
<p>Harry was leaning over slightly, his head almost touching her
shoulder, watching the pages as she turned them, as though he might
be able to glean valuable information from glimpsing the page for
only a quarter-second. Breakfast hadn't been long ago, and she
could clearly identify, from the faint scent of his breath, that
Harry'd eaten banana pudding for dessert.</p>
<p>Harry spoke again. "So with all that said... and please take
this as a positive reinforcement... did you really try to invent a
way to <i>mass-produce immortality</i> so that I could <i>pay off
my debt to Lucius Malfoy?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said in an even smaller voice. Even when she
<i>tried</i> to think like Harry, it seemed she hadn't yet got the
knack of it. "So what've you been doing this whole time,
Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry made a disgusted face. "Trying to collect evidence on the
whole 'Who Framed Hermione Granger' mystery."</p>
<p>"I..." Hermione looked up at Harry. "Shouldn't I... be trying to
solve my <i>own</i> mystery, though?" It hadn't been her first
thought, her first priority, but now that Harry mentioned it...</p>
<p>"That wouldn't work in this case," Harry said soberly. "There's
too many people who'll talk to me and not you... and I'm also sorry
to say that some of them made me promise not to talk to anyone
else. Sorry, I don't think you can help much on this one."</p>
<p>"Okay, I guess," Hermione said leadenly. "Fine. You do
everything. You gather all the clues and talk to all the suspects
while I just sit here in the library. Let me know after it turns
out that it was Professor Quirrell who did it."</p>
<p>"Hermione..." Harry said. "Why is it so important <i>who</i>
does what? Shouldn't it be more important to get everything solved,
than who solves it?"</p>
<p>"I guess you're right," Hermione said. She lifted her hands to
press up at her eyes. "I guess it doesn't matter any more.
Everyone's going to think - I <i>know</i> it's not your fault,
Harry, you were - you were being Good, you were a perfect gentlemen
- but no matter what I do now, they'll all think that I'm just -
someone for you to rescue." She paused, and said, with her voice
quivering, "And maybe they're <i>right</i>, Harry."</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa, hold on there a second -"</p>
<p>"I can't scare Dementors. I can get Outstandings in Charms
class, but I can't scare Dementors."</p>
<p>"<i>I've got a mysterious dark side!</i>" Harry hissed, after
his head turned around to scan the library. (There was one boy in a
distant corner, who did look in their direction occasionally, but
he would've been too far away to hear anything even without the
Quieting Barrier.) "I've got a dark side that <i>definitely</i>
isn't a child, and who knows what other crazy magical stuff going
on in my head - Professor Quirrell claimed that I become whoever I
believe I am - that's all <i>cheating,</i> don't you see, Hermione?
There's an arrangement that the school administration made that I'm
not supposed to talk about, so that the Boy-Who-Lived could have
more time to study every day, I'm <i>cheating</i> and you're
<i>still beating me in Charms class.</i> I'm - I'm probably not -
the Boy-Who-Lived probably isn't even something that you could
properly call a child - and you're <i>still competing</i> with
that. Don't you realize, if it <i>wasn't</i> for people paying
attention to me, you'd look like the most powerful witch to come
along in a century? When you can fight three older bullies by
yourself, and win?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said, pressing her hands again over her
eyes, with her voice wavering. "All I know is - even if that's all
<i>true</i> - nobody's ever going to see me for myself anymore,
ever."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said after a while. "I see what you mean.
Instead of the famous Potter-and-Granger research team, there'll be
Harry Potter and his lab assistant. Um... here's an idea. How about
if I <i>don't</i> focus on making money for a while? I mean, the
debt doesn't come due until I graduate Hogwarts. So you can do it
yourself and show the world you've still got it. And if you
coincidentally crack the secret of immortality along the way, we'll
just call it a bonus."</p>
<p>The thought of Harry relying on <i>her</i> to come up with a
solution seemed... like a crushing burden of responsibility to dump
on a poor traumatized twelve-year-old girl, and she wanted to hug
him for offering her a way to restore her self-respect as a
heroine, and it was what she <i>deserved</i> for being a horrible
person and speaking sharply to Harry all the time, when all along
he'd been a truer friend to her than she'd ever been to him, and it
was good that he still thought she could do things, and...</p>
<p>"Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind's
running in all different directions?" she managed.</p>
<p>"My own approach is usually to identify the different desires,
give them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let
them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones
are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my
Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco,
Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad,
Mum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter."</p>
<p>Hermione considered trying this before her Common Sense warned
that it might be a dangerous sort of thing to pretend. "There's a
copy of <i>me</i> inside your head?"</p>
<p>"Of course there is!" Harry said. The boy suddenly looked a bit
more vulnerable. "You mean there <i>isn't</i> a copy of me living
in <i>your</i> head?"</p>
<p>There <i>was,</i> she realized; and not only that, it talked in
Harry's exact voice.</p>
<p>"It's rather unnerving now that I think about it," said
Hermione. "I do have a copy of you living in my head. It's talking
to me right now using your voice, arguing how this is perfectly
normal."</p>
<p>"Good," Harry said seriously. "I mean, I don't see how people
could be friends without that."</p>
<p>She continued reading her book, then, Harry seeming content to
watch the pages over her shoulder.</p>
<p>She'd gotten all the way to number seventy, Katherine Scott,
who'd apparently invented a way to turn small animals into lemon
tarts, when she finally worked up the courage to speak.</p>
<p>"Harry?" she said. (She was leaning a bit away from him now,
though she didn't realize it.) "If there's a copy of Draco Malfoy
in your head, does that mean you're friends with Draco Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said. He sighed. "Yeah, I'd been meaning to talk
with you about this anyway. I kind of wish I'd talked to you
sooner. Anyway, how can I put this... I was corrupting him?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean <i>corrupting?</i>"</p>
<p>"Tempting him to the Light Side of the Force."</p>
<p>Her mouth just stayed open.</p>
<p>"You know, like the Emperor and Darth Vader, only in
reverse."</p>
<p>"<i>Draco Malfoy</i>," she said. "Harry, do you have <i>any idea
-</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"- the sort of things Malfoy has been <i>saying</i> about me?
What he said he'd <i>do</i> to me, as soon as he got the chance? I
don't know what he told to <i>you,</i> but Daphne Greengrass told
me what Malfoy says when he's in Slytherin. It's
<i>unspeakable,</i> Harry! It's unspeakable in the completely
literal sense that I can't say it out loud!"</p>
<p>"When was this?" Harry said. "At the start of the year? Did
Daphne say <i>when</i> this was?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said. "Because it doesn't matter when, Harry.
Anyone who said things - like Malfoy said - they can't be a good
person. It doesn't matter what you tempted him to, he's still a
rotten person, because no matter <i>what</i> a good person would
<i>never</i> -"</p>
<p>"You're wrong." Harry said, looking her straight in the eyes. "I
can guess what Draco threatened to do to you, because the second
time I met him, he talked about doing it to a ten-year-old girl.
But don't you see, on the day Draco Malfoy arrived in Hogwarts,
he'd spent his whole previous life being raised by <i>Death
Eaters.</i> It would've required a <i>supernatural intervention</i>
for him to have <i>your</i> morality given <i>his</i> environment
-"</p>
<p>Hermione was shaking her head violently. "<i>No,</i> Harry.
Nobody has to <i>tell</i> you that hurting people is wrong, it's
not something you don't do because the teacher says it's not
allowed, it's something you don't do because - because you can
<i>see when people are hurting,</i> don't you know that, Harry?"
Her voice was shaking now. "That's not - that's not a <i>rule</i>
people follow like the rules for algebra! If you can't <i>see</i>
it, if you can't feel it <i>here,</i>" her hand slapped down over
the center of her chest, not quite where her heart was located, but
that didn't matter because it was all really in the brain anyway,
"then you just don't have it!"</p>
<p>The thought came to her, then, that Harry might <i>not</i> have
it.</p>
<p>"There's history books you haven't read," Harry said quietly.
"There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give
you a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it
was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a
popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle,
with a dozen live cats in it, and -"</p>
<p>"Stop," she said.</p>
<p>"- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good
clean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning
women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built,
Hermione, the way people are built to <i>feel</i> inside -" Harry
put a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct
position, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his
head at around the ear level, "- is that they hurt when they see
their <i>friends</i> hurting. Someone inside their circle of
concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an
off-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or
sometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't
<i>learn</i> otherwise. So, no, it does <i>not</i> indicate that
Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up
believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -"</p>
<p>"If you believe that<i>,</i>" she said with her voice unsteady,
"if you <i>can</i> believe that, then you're evil. People are
always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter what anyone
<i>tells</i> you to do, you're the one who does it. Everyone knows
that -"</p>
<p>"<i>No they don't!</i> You grew up in a post-World-War-Two
society where 'I vas only followink orders' is something
<i>everyone knows</i> the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century
they would've called it honourable fealty." Harry's voice was
rising. "Do you think you're, you're just <i>genetically</i> better
than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been transported
back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd realize <i>all on
your own</i> that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong,
slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your
circle of concern? Do you think you'd <i>finish</i> realizing all
that by the first day you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever <i>told</i>
Draco he was personally responsible for becoming more ethical than
the society he grew up in. And <i>despite that</i>, it only took
him four months to get to the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn
falling off a building." Harry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever
seen him. "I'm not <i>finished</i> corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I
think <i>he's done pretty well so far.</i>"</p>
<p>The problem with having such a good memory was that she
<i>did</i> remember.</p>
<p>She remembered Draco Malfoy grabbing her wrist, so hard she'd
had a bruise afterward, while she was falling off the roof of
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>She remembered Draco Malfoy helping her up, after that
mysterious tripping jinx had sent her stumbling into the Slytherin
Quidditch Captain's plate of food.</p>
<p>And she remembered - it was, in fact, the reason she'd brought
up the topic in the first place - how she'd felt when she'd heard
Draco Malfoy's testimony under Veritaserum.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you <i>tell</i> me any of this?" Hermione said, and
despite herself, her voice rose in pitch. "If I'd <i>known</i>
-"</p>
<p>"It wasn't my secret to tell you," Harry said. "Draco's the one
who would've been at risk, if his father had found out."</p>
<p>"I'm not stupid, Mr. Potter. What's the <i>real</i> reason you
didn't tell me, and what were you <i>actually</i> doing with Mr.
Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Ah. Well..." Harry broke eye contact with her, and looked down
at the library table.</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy told the Aurors under Veritaserum that he wanted
to know if he could beat me, so he challenged me to a duel to
<i>test it empirically</i>. Those were his <i>exact words</i>
according to the transcript."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said, still not meeting her eyes. "Hermione
Granger. Of <i>course</i> she'll remember the exact wording. It
doesn't matter if she's chained to her chair, on trial for murder
in front of the entire Wizengamot -"</p>
<p>"What were you <i>really</i> doing with Draco Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Harry winced, and said, "Probably not <i>quite</i> what you're
thinking, but..."</p>
<p>The horror scaled and scaled within her, and finally broke
loose.</p>
<p>"<i>You were doing SCIENCE with him?</i>"</p>
<p>"Well -"</p>
<p>"<i>You were doing SCIENCE with him? You were supposed to be
doing science with ME!</i>"</p>
<p>"It wasn't like that! It's not like I was doing <i>real</i>
science with him! I was just, you know, <i>teaching</i> him some
harmless bits of Muggle science, like elementary physics with
algebra and so on - it's not like I was doing original magical
research with him, the way I was with you -"</p>
<p>"And I suppose you didn't tell <i>him</i> about <i>me,</i>
either?"</p>
<p>"Um, of course not?" Harry said. "I've been doing science with
him since October, and he wasn't exactly ready to hear about you
then -"</p>
<p>The inexpressible sense of betrayal inside her was welling and
welling, taking over everything, her rising voice, her glaring
eyes, her nose that she was certain was starting to run, the
burning in her throat. She shoved herself up from the table and
took a step back, the better to look down on her betrayer, and her
voice was very nearly screeching as she yelled, "<i>That is not
okay! You can't do science with two people at once!</i>"</p>
<p>"Er -"</p>
<p>"I mean, you can't do science with two different people and
<i>not tell them about each other!</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said cautiously. "I <i>did</i> think of that, and
I was very careful not to get your research mixed together with
anything I did with him -"</p>
<p>"You were being <i>careful."</i> She would have <i>hissed</i>
it, if it had contained any Ss.</p>
<p>Harry raised a hand and rubbed at his messy hair, and somehow
that made her want to scream at him even <i>more.</i> "Miss
Granger," said Harry, "I think this conversation has become
<i>metaphorical</i> on a level that's, um..."</p>
<p><i>"What?</i>" she screeched at him, at the top of her lungs
inside their Quieting barrier.</p>
<p>Then she realized and got so red that if she'd had an adult
level of magical power her hair would have spontaneously caught on
fire.</p>
<p>The lone other patron in the library, the Ravenclaw boy sitting
in the far opposite corner, was staring wide-eyed at both of them
while making a rather sad attempt to conceal it by holding up a
book just below his face.</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said with a small sigh. "So, keeping <i>firmly in
mind</i> that it was just a bad metaphor, and that <i>real
scientists</i> collaborate with each other <i>all the time,</i> I
don't think that I was cheating. Scientists often keep quiet about
projects they're working on. You and I are doing research that
we're keeping secret, and there were reasons not to tell Draco
Malfoy in particular - he wouldn't have stayed around me at all, in
the beginning, if he'd known I was your friend and not your rival.
And Draco would've been the one at risk if I'd told anyone else
about <i>him</i> -"</p>
<p>"Is that really all?" she said. "<i>Really,</i> Harry? You
didn't want both of us to <i>feel special,</i> like we were the
<i>only</i> ones you wanted to be with and the <i>only</i> ones who
got to be with you?"</p>
<p>"That was <i>not</i> why I -"</p>
<p>Harry paused.</p>
<p>Harry looked at her.</p>
<p>All the blood was rushing back into her face, there probably
should've been steam coming out of her ears, which in turn
should've been melting off her head with the liquid flesh running
down into her neck, as she realized what she'd just blurted
out.</p>
<p>Harry was staring at her in dawning and complete terror.</p>
<p>"Well..." she said in a rather high-pitched voice, "it's... oh,
I don't know, Harry! <i>Is</i> it just a metaphor? When a boy
spends a hundred thousand Galleons to save a girl from certain
doom, she's entitled to wonder, don't you think? It's like being
bought flowers, only, you see, rather <i>more</i> so -"</p>
<p>Harry shoved himself up from the table and took a staggering
step back, even as he brought up his arms to wave frantically.
<i>"That's not why I did it! I did it because we're
friends!</i>"</p>
<p>"Just friends?"</p>
<p>Harry Potter's breathing was starting to scale up toward
hyperventilation. "Very good friends! Extra-special friends, even!
Best friends forever, possibly! But not <i>that</i> kind of
friends!"</p>
<p>"Is it really that awful to think about?" she said with a catch
in her voice. "I mean - I'm not saying <i>I'm</i> in love with
<i>you,</i> but -"</p>
<p>"Oh, you're not? Thank <i>goodness.</i>" Harry brought up the
sleeve of his robe and wiped across his forehead. "Look, Hermione,
please don't misunderstand, I'm sure you're a wonderful person
-"</p>
<p>She took a staggering step back.</p>
<p>"- but - even with my dark side -"</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> what this is about?" said Hermione. "But I - I
wouldn't -"</p>
<p>"No, no, I mean, I have a mysterious dark side and probably
other weird magic stuff going on, you <i>know</i> I'm not a normal
child, not really -"</p>
<p>"It's okay to not be normal," she said, feeling increasingly
desperate and confused. <i>"I'm</i> okay with it -"</p>
<p>"But <i>even with all that weird magical stuff</i> letting me be
more adult than I should be, I haven't gone through puberty yet and
there's no hormones in my bloodstream and my brain is <i>physically
incapable</i> of falling in love with anyone. So I'm not in love
with you! I couldn't possibly be in love with you! For all I know
at this point, six months from now my brain is going to wake up and
decide to fall in love with Professor Snape! Er, can I take it from
this that you <i>have</i> been through puberty?"</p>
<p>"Eep," said Hermione in a high-pitched sound. She swayed where
she stood, and a moment later Harry was rushing over to her side
and helping lower her to sit on the ground, bracing her body with
firm hands.</p>
<p>The fact was that she <i>had</i> staggered over to Professor
McGonagall's office back in December, not in total surprise because
she'd done her reading, but still rather <i>queasily</i> and it was
with great relief that she'd learned that witches had Charms to
deal with the inconveniences and <i>what was Harry even doing
asking a poor innocent girl a question like that -</i></p>
<p>"Look, I'm <i>sorry</i>," Harry said frantically. "I really
didn't mean most of that the way it sounded! I'm sure that anyone
taking the outside view of the whole situation and offering betting
odds on who I finally married would assign a higher probability to
you than anyone else I can think of -"</p>
<p>Her intelligence, which had barely been starting to pull itself
together, promptly exploded into sparks and flame.</p>
<p>"- though not necessarily a probability higher than fifty
percent, I mean, from the outside view there's a lot of other
possibilities, and who I like before I hit puberty probably isn't
all that strongly <i>diagnostic</i> of who I'll be with seven years
later - I don't want to sound like I'm <i>promising</i> anything
-"</p>
<p>Her throat was making some sort of high-pitched sounds and she
wasn't really listening to exactly what. All her universe had
narrowed to Harry's terrible, terrible voice.</p>
<p>"- and besides I've been reading about evolutionary psychology,
and, well, there are all these suggestions that one man and one
woman living together happily ever afterward may be more the
exception rather than the rule, and in hunter-gatherer tribes it
was more often just staying together for two or three years to
raise a child during its most vulnerable stages - and, I mean,
considering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional
marriages, it seems like it might be the sort of thing that needs
some clever reworking - especially if we actually do solve
immortality -"</p>

<p>Tano Wolfe, of fifth-year Ravenclaw, slowly stood up from his
library desk, from which vantage point he'd just watched Granger
flee the library, sobbing. He hadn't been able to hear the
argument, but it had clearly been one of <i>those.</i></p>
<p>Slowly and with his knees trembling, Tano approached the
Boy-Who-Lived, who was staring in the direction of the library
doors, still vibrating from the force of how they'd been
slammed.</p>
<p>Tano didn't particularly want to do this, but Harry Potter
<i>had</i> been Sorted into Ravenclaw. The Boy-Who-Lived was,
technically, his fellow Ravenclaw. And that meant there was a
Code.</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived didn't say anything as Tano approached him,
but his gaze wasn't friendly.</p>
<p>Tano swallowed, laid a hand on Harry Potter's shoulder, and
recited, his voice cracking only slightly, "Witches! Go figure,
huh?"</p>
<p>"<i>Remove your hand before I cast it into the outer
darkness.</i>"</p>
<p>The library doors slammed open again in the wake of another
departure.</p>
