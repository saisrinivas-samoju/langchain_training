<p>Reviews make me happy. You can leave reviews on any chapter, no

<i>one</i> review per chapter.</p>
<p>This is <i>not</i> a strict single-point-of-departure fic -
there exists a primary point of departure, at some point in the
past, but also other alterations. The best term I've heard for this
fic is "parallel universe".</p>
<p>The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious
clues, truly obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers
successfully decode, and massive evidence left out in plain sight.
This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable, and meant
to be solved.</p>
<p>The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of
a TV show running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose
episodes are individually plotted but with an overall arc building
to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>The story has been corrected to British English up to Ch. 17,
and further Britpicking is currently in progress (see the /HPMOR
subreddit).</p>
<p>All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind
that, beyond the realm of science, the views of the characters may
not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is
a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered by darker characters may be
untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.</p>

<p>Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase
has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are
stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history,
and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback
science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old
tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer
of books above the books in front. And it still isn't enough. Books
are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little
heaps under the windows.</p>
<p>This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent
Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia
Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres.</p>
<p>There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an
unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to <i>Mr. H.
Potter</i> in emerald-green ink.</p>
<p>The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other,
but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be
uncivilised.</p>
<p>"You're joking," Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated
that he was very much afraid that she was serious.</p>
<p>"My sister was a witch," Petunia repeated. She looked
frightened, but stood her ground. "Her husband was a wizard."</p>
<p>"This is absurd!" Michael said sharply. "They were at our
wedding - they visited for Christmas -"</p>
<p>"I told them you weren't to know," Petunia whispered. "But it's
true. I've seen things -"</p>
<p>The Professor rolled his eyes. "Dear, I understand that you're
not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how
easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.
Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they
could always guess what you were thinking, that's called cold
reading -"</p>
<p>"It wasn't bending spoons -"</p>
<p>"What was it, then?"</p>
<p>Petunia bit her lip. "I can't just tell you. You'll think I'm -"
She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I wasn't - always like this -" She
gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. "Lily
did this. Because I - because I <i>begged</i> her. For years, I
begged her. Lily had <i>always</i> been prettier than me, and
I'd... been mean to her, because of that, and then she got
<i>magic,</i> can you imagine how I felt? And I <i>begged</i> her
to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too, even
if I couldn't have her magic, at least I could be pretty."</p>
<p>Tears were gathering in Petunia's eyes.</p>
<p>"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous
excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,
or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I
hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I
was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was
the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,
and that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to
myself, <i>what kind of parent names their child Dudley
Dursley?</i> It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out
in front of me, and I couldn't stand it. And I wrote to my sister
and told her that if she didn't help me I'd rather just -"</p>
<p>Petunia stopped.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told
me it was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank
this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin
cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people
were <i>nice</i> to me," her voice broke, "and after that I
couldn't hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what
her magic brought her in the end -"</p>
<p>"Darling," Michael said gently, "you got sick, you gained some
weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own.
Or being sick made you change your diet -"</p>
<p>"She was a witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."</p>
<p>"Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his
voice. "You <i>know</i> that can't be true. Do I really have to
explain why?"</p>
<p>Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.
"My love, I know I can't win arguments with you, but please, you
have to trust me on this -"</p>
<p>"<i>Dad! Mum!</i>"</p>
<p>The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they'd
forgotten there was a third person in the room.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Mum, <i>your</i> parents didn't have
magic, did they?"</p>
<p>"No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.</p>
<p>"Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her
letter. How did <i>they</i> get convinced?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Petunia said. "They didn't just send a letter. They sent
a professor from Hogwarts. He -" Petunia's eyes flicked to Michael.
"He showed us some magic."</p>
<p>"Then you don't have to fight over this," Harry said firmly.
Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would
listen to him. "If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor
here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it's
true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it's false. That's what
the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve
things just by arguing."</p>
<p>The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as
usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, <i>magic?</i> I thought
<i>you'd</i> know better than to take this seriously, son, even if
you're only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing
there is!"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably
better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry
had been sent to the best primary schools - and when that didn't
work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of
starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study
whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his
fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he
entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,
maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching
biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the
advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of
course; that's what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you
conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a
ten-year-old <i>seriously?</i> Hardly.</p>
<p>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.</p>
<p>"Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad,
look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on
Physics. There's a quote there about how philosophers say a great
deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong,
because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is
observation - that you just have to look at the world and report
what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can't think of where
to find something about how it's an ideal of science to settle
things by experiment instead of arguments -"</p>
<p>His mother looked down at him and smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But
-" her head rose back up to stare at her husband. "I don't want to
win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen
to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once -"</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes briefly. <i>Hopeless.</i> Both of his
parents were just hopeless.</p>
<p>Now his parents were getting into one of <i>those</i> arguments
again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty,
and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go to my room," Harry announced. His voice
trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about this,
Mum, Dad, we'll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course, Harry," said his father, and his mother gave him a
reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed
the stairs to his bedroom.</p>
<p>He shut the door behind him and tried to think.</p>
<p>The funny thing was, he <i>should</i> have agreed with Dad. No
one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum,
there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep
something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather
suspicious sort of excuse.</p>
<p>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being
insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter
herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without
a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the
universe really working like that.</p>
<p>Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic
was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter
from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
<p>Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. <i>Don't believe
everything you think,</i> one of his books had said.</p>
<p>But this bizarre certainty... Harry was finding himself just
<i>expecting</i> that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and
wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was
making no effort to guard itself against falsification - wasn't
making excuses in advance for why there wouldn't be a professor, or
the professor would only be able to bend spoons.</p>
<p><i>Where do you come from, strange little prediction?</i> Harry
directed the thought at his brain. <i>Why do I believe what I
believe?</i></p>
<p>Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in
this particular case, he had no <i>clue</i> what his brain was
thinking.</p>
<p>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords
pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to
do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.</p>
<p>He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started
writing.</p>
<p><i>Dear Deputy Headmistress</i></p>
<p>Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another,
tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil.
This called for careful calligraphy.</p>
<p><i>Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,</i></p>
<p><i>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:</i></p>
<p><i>I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,
addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic
parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are
dead. I was adopted by Lily's sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her
husband, Michael Verres-Evans.</i></p>
<p><i>I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional
on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she
knows about magic, and she can't use it herself. My father is
highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don't know where to
obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance
letter.</i></p>
<p><i>Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to
Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family
that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school
materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be
extremely helpful.</i></p>
<p><i>Sincerely,</i></p>
<p><i>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</i></p>
<p>Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and
put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further
consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap
of the envelope, into which, using a penknife's tip, he impressed
the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this
madness, he was going to do it with style.</p>
<p>Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was
sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to
show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing
one of his father's favourite meals to show how loving she was. It
didn't look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary
as arguments could be, <i>not arguing</i> was somehow much
worse.</p>
<p>"Mum," Harry said into the unnerving silence, "I'm going to test
the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to
Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking
shocked. "I - I don't know, I think you just have to own a magic
owl."</p>
<p>That should've sounded highly suspicious, <i>oh, so there's no
way to test your theory then,</i> but the peculiar certainty in
Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.</p>
<p>"Well, the letter got here somehow," Harry said, "so I'll just
wave it around outside and call 'letter for Hogwarts!' and see if
an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?"</p>
<p>His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. <i>Of
course,</i> Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing
that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so far as
to <i>test</i> the hypothesis, or even <i>watch</i> it being
tested, that would feel like <i>associating</i> himself with
that...</p>
<p>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden,
did it occur to him that if an owl <i>did</i> come down and snatch
the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about
it.</p>
<p><i>But - well - that can't</i> really <i>happen, can it? No
matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down
and grabs this envelope, I'm going to have worries a lot more
important than what Dad thinks.</i></p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the
air.</p>
<p>He swallowed.</p>
<p>Calling out <i>Letter for Hogwarts!</i> while holding an
envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden
was... actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about
it.</p>
<p><i>No. I'm better than Dad. I will use the scientific method
even if it makes me feel stupid.</i></p>
<p>"Letter -" Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a
whispered croak.</p>
<p>Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky,
"<i>Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?</i>"</p>
<p>"Harry?" asked a bemused woman's voice, one of the
neighbours.</p>
<p>Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the
envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was
hot with shame.</p>
<p>An old woman's face peered out from above the neighbouring
fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the
occasional babysitter. "What are you doing, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Harry said in a strangled voice. "Just - testing a
really silly theory -"</p>
<p>"Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>Harry froze in place<i>.</i></p>
<p>"Yes," Harry's lips said a little while later. "I got a letter
from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but
-"</p>
<p>"But you don't <i>have</i> an owl. Poor dear! I can't imagine
<i>what</i> someone must have been thinking, sending you just the
standard letter."</p>
<p>A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an
expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over
his envelope.</p>
<p>"Just leave it to me, dear," said Mrs. Figg, "and in a jiffy or
two I'll have someone over."</p>
<p>And her face disappeared from over the fence.</p>
<p>There was a long silence in the garden.</p>
<p>Then a boy's voice said, calmly and quietly, "What."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="2">Chapter 2</h2><h3>Everything I Believe Is
False</h3>
<p>#include "stddisclaimer.h"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who
could be responsible for anything."</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Now, just to be clear," Harry said, "if the professor does
levitate you, Dad, when you know you haven't been attached to any
wires, that's going to be sufficient evidence. You're not going to
turn around and say that it's a magician's trick. That wouldn't be
fair play. If you feel that way, you should say so <i>now</i>, and
we can figure out a different experiment instead."</p>
<p>Harry's father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes.
"Yes, Harry."</p>
<p>"And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be
able to do this, and if that doesn't happen, you'll admit you're
mistaken. Nothing about how magic doesn't work when people are
sceptical of it, or anything like that."</p>
<p>Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry with a
bemused expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes and
pointed hat, but when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish,
which didn't go together with the look at all. At first glance she
looked like someone who ought to cackle and put babies into
cauldrons, but the whole effect was ruined as soon as she opened
her mouth. "Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter?" she said. "Shall I go
ahead and demonstrate?"</p>
<p>"<i>Sufficient?</i> Probably not," Harry said. "But at least it
will <i>help.</i> Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress."</p>
<p>"Just Professor will do," said she, and then, "<i>Wingardium
Leviosa</i>."</p>
<p>Harry looked at his father.</p>
<p>"Huh," Harry said.</p>
<p>His father looked back at him. "Huh," his father echoed.</p>
<p>Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall.
"All right, you can put me down now."</p>
<p>His father was lowered carefully to the ground.</p>
<p>Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just
that strange part of him which had <i>already</i> been convinced,
but... "That's a bit of an anticlimax," Harry said. "You'd think
there'd be some kind of more dramatic mental event associated with
updating on an observation of infinitesimal probability -" Harry
stopped himself. Mum, the witch, and even his Dad were giving him
<i>that look</i> again. "I mean, with finding out that everything I
believe is false."</p>
<p>Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to
have been flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the
universe, none of which allowed this to happen. But instead his
brain just seemed to be going, <i>All right, I saw the Hogwarts
Professor wave her wand and make your father rise into the air, now
what?</i></p>
<p>The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite
amused. "Would you like a further demonstration, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to," Harry said. "We've performed a definitive
experiment. But..." Harry hesitated. He couldn't help himself.
Actually, under the circumstances, he <i>shouldn't</i> be helping
himself. It was right and proper to be curious. "What else
<i>can</i> you do?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned into a cat.</p>
<p>Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he
tripped over a stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom
with a <i>thwack.</i> His hands came down to catch himself without
quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in his
shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.</p>
<p>At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said the witch, sounding sincere, though
the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. "I should have
warned you."</p>
<p>Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked.
<i>"You can't DO that!"</i></p>
<p>"It's only a Transfiguration," said Professor McGonagall. "An
Animagus transformation, to be exact."</p>
<p>"You turned into a cat! A <i>SMALL</i> cat! You violated
Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's
implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it
destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are
<i>COMPLICATED!</i> A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's
anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the
<i>neurology?</i> How can you go on <i>thinking</i> using a
cat-sized brain?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's lips were twitching harder now.
"Magic."</p>
<p>"Magic <i>isn't enough</i> to do that! You'd have to be a
god!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall blinked. "That's the first time I've ever
been called <i>that.</i>"</p>
<p>A blur was coming over Harry's vision, as his brain started to
comprehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified
universe with mathematically regular laws, that was what had been
flushed down the toilet; the whole notion of <i>physics</i>. Three
thousand years of resolving big complicated things into smaller
pieces, discovering that the music of the planets was the same tune
as a falling apple, finding that the true laws were perfectly
universal and had no exceptions anywhere and took the form of
simple maths governing the smallest parts, <i>not to mention</i>
that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of neurons, a
brain was what a person <i>was</i> -</p>
<p>And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.</p>
<p>A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry's lips and
the winner poured out: "And, and what kind of incantation is
<i>Wingardium Leviosa?</i> Who invents the words to these spells,
nursery schoolers?"</p>
<p>"That will do, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said crisply,
though her eyes shone with suppressed amusement. "If you wish to
learn about magic, I suggest that we finalise the paperwork so that
you can go to Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts
together. The March of Reason would just have to start over, that
was all; they still had the experimental method and that was the
important thing. "How do I get to Hogwarts, then?"</p>
<p>A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted
from her by tweezers.</p>
<p>"Hold on a moment, Harry," his father said. "Remember why you
haven't been going to school up until now? What about your
condition?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. "His condition?
What's this?"</p>
<p>"I don't sleep right," Harry said. He waved his hands
helplessly. "My sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go
to sleep two hours later, every day. I can't fall asleep any
earlier than that, and then the next day I go to sleep two hours
later than <i>that.</i> 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, until it goes around
the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no difference
and I'm a wreck that whole day. That's why I haven't been going to
a normal school up until now."</p>
<p>"One of the reasons," said his mother. Harry shot her a
glare.</p>
<p>McGonagall gave a long <i>hmmmmm.</i> "I can't recall hearing
about such a condition before..." she said slowly. "I'll check with
Madam Pomfrey to see if she knows any remedies." Then her face
brightened. "No, I'm sure this won't be a problem - I'll find a
solution in time. Now," and her gaze sharpened again, "what are
these <i>other</i> reasons?"</p>
<p>Harry sent his parents a glare. "I am a conscientious objector
to child conscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer
for a disintegrating school system's failure to provide teachers or
study materials of even minimally adequate quality."</p>
<p>Both of Harry's parents howled with laughter at that, like they
thought it was all a big joke. "Oh," said Harry's father, eyes
bright, "is <i>that</i> why you bit a maths teacher in third
year."</p>
<p>"<i>She didn't know what a logarithm was!</i>"</p>
<p>"Of course," seconded Harry's mother. "Biting her was a very
mature response to that."</p>
<p>Harry's father nodded. "A well-considered policy for addressing
the problem of teachers who don't understand logarithms."</p>
<p>"I was <i>seven years old!</i> How long are you going to keep on
bringing that up?"</p>
<p>"I know," said his mother sympathetically, "you bite <i>one</i>
maths teacher and they never let you forget it, do they?"</p>
<p>Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. "There! You see what I
have to deal with?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Petunia, and fled through the backdoor into
the garden, from which her screams of laughter were clearly
audible.</p>
<p>"There, ah, there," Professor McGonagall seemed to be having
trouble speaking for some reason, "there is to be no biting of
teachers at Hogwarts, is that quite clear, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry scowled at her. "Fine, I won't bite anyone who doesn't
bite me first."</p>
<p>Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room
briefly upon hearing that.</p>
<p>"Well," Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry's parents had
composed themselves and returned. "Well. I think, under the
circumstances, that I should avoid taking you to purchase your
study materials until a day or two before school begins."</p>
<p>"What? Why? The other children already know magic, don't they? I
have to start catching up right away!"</p>
<p>"Rest assured, Mr. Potter," replied Professor McGonagall,
"Hogwarts is quite capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect,
Mr. Potter, that if I leave you alone for two months with your
schoolbooks, even without a wand, I will return to this house only
to find a crater billowing purple smoke, a depopulated city
surrounding it and a plague of flaming zebras terrorising what
remains of England."</p>
<p>Harry's mother and father nodded in perfect unison.</p>
<p>"<i>Mum! Dad!</i>"</p>

Alternatives</h3>
<p>If J. K. Rowling asks you about this story, you know
nothing.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"But then the question is - who?"</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Good Lord," said the barman, peering at Harry, "is this - can
this be -?"</p>
<p>Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he
could, though it came up to somewhere around the tips of his
eyebrows. A question like <i>that</i> deserved his very best.</p>
<p>"Am I - could I be - maybe - you never know - if I'm <i>not</i>
- but then the question is - <i>who?</i>"</p>
<p>"Bless my soul," whispered the old barman. "Harry Potter... what
an honour."</p>
<p>Harry blinked, then rallied. "Well, yes, you're quite
perceptive; most people don't realise that so quickly -"</p>
<p>"That's enough," Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened
on Harry's shoulder. "Don't pester the boy, Tom, he's new to all
this."</p>
<p>"But it is him?" quavered an old woman. "It's Harry Potter?"
With a scraping sound, she got up from her chair.</p>
<p>"Doris -" McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around
the room should have been enough to intimidate anyone.</p>
<p>"I only want to shake his hand," the woman whispered. She bent
low and stuck out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused
and more uncomfortable than he ever had in his life, carefully
shook. Tears fell from the woman's eyes onto their clasped hands.
"My granson was an Auror," she whispered to him. "Died in
seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens for you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Harry said automatically, and then he turned
his head and shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading
look.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the general
rush was about to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new
referent for the phrase "Crack of Doom", and everyone froze in
place.</p>
<p>"We're in a hurry," Professor McGonagall said in a voice that
sounded perfectly, utterly normal.</p>
<p>They left the bar without any trouble.</p>
<p>"Professor?" Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He had
meant to ask what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an
entirely different question instead. "Who was that pale man, by the
corner? The man with the twitching eye?"</p>
<p>"Hm?" said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised;
perhaps she hadn't expected that question either. "That was
Professor Quirinus Quirrell. He'll be teaching Defence Against the
Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"I had the strangest feeling that I knew him..." Harry rubbed
his forehead. "And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand." Like
meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went
drastically wrong... that wasn't really it at all, but Harry
couldn't find words. "And what <i>was...</i> all of that?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. "Mr.
Potter... do you know... how <i>much</i> have you been told...
about how your parents died?"</p>
<p>Harry returned a steady look. "My parents are alive and well,
and they always refused to talk about how my <i>genetic</i> parents
died. From which I infer that it wasn't good."</p>
<p>"An admirable loyalty," said Professor McGonagall. Her voice
went low. "Though it hurts a little to hear you say it like that.
Lily and James were friends of mine."</p>
<p>Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. "I'm sorry," he said in a
small voice. "But I <i>have</i> a Mum and Dad. And I know that I'd
just make myself unhappy by comparing that reality to... something
perfect that I built up in my imagination."</p>
<p>"That is amazingly wise of you," Professor McGonagall said
quietly. "But your <i>genetic</i> parents died very well indeed,
protecting you."</p>
<p><i>Protecting me?</i></p>
<p>Something strange clutched at Harry's heart. "What... <i>did</i>
happen?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry's forehead,
and his vision blurred for a moment. "Something of a disguise," she
said, "so that this doesn't happen again, not until you're ready."
Then her wand licked out again, and tapped three times on a brick
wall...</p>
<p>...which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and
shivered into a huge archway, revealing a long row of shops with
signs advertising cauldrons and dragon livers.</p>
<p>Harry didn't blink. It wasn't like anyone was turning into a
cat.</p>
<p>And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding
world.</p>
<p>There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots ("Made with real
Flubber!") and "Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!" There
were goggles that would turn anything you looked at green, and a
lineup of comfy armchairs with ejection seats for emergencies.</p>
<p>Harry's head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind
itself off his neck. It was like walking through the magical items
section of an <i>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</i> rulebook (he
didn't play the game, but he did enjoy reading the rulebooks).
Harry desperately didn't want to miss a single item for sale, in
case it was one of the three you needed to complete the cycle of
infinite <i>wish</i> spells.</p>
<p>Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely without
thinking, veer off from the Deputy Headmistress and start heading
straight into the shop, a front of blue bricks with bronze-metal
trim. He was brought back to reality only when Professor McGonagall
stepped right in front of him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" she said.</p>
<p>Harry blinked, then realised what he'd just done. "I'm sorry! I
forgot for a moment that I was with you instead of my family."
Harry gestured at the shop window, which displayed fiery letters
that shone piercingly bright and yet remote, spelling out
<i>Bigbam's Brilliant Books</i>. "When you walk past a bookshop you
haven't visited before, you have to go in and look around. That's
the family rule."</p>
<p>"That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Mr. Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the
bank of the wizarding world. Your <i>genetic</i> family vault is
there, with the inheritance your <i>genetic</i> parents left you,
and you'll need money for school supplies." She sighed. "And, I
suppose, a certain amount of spending money for books could be
excused as well. Though you might want to hold off for a time.
Hogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And the
tower in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more
broad-ranging library of its own. Any book you bought now would
probably be a duplicate."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and they walked on.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, it's a <i>great</i> distraction," Harry
said as his head kept swivelling, "probably the best distraction
anyone has ever tried on me, but don't think I've forgotten about
our pending discussion."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. "Your parents - or your mother at
any rate - may have been very wise not to tell you."</p>
<p>"So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There
is a certain flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"I suppose it would be rather pointless," the witch said
tightly, "when anyone on the street could tell you the story. Very
well."</p>
<p>And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord,
Voldemort.</p>
<p>"Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it
wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond
clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of
yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the
word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like
You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding
wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives.
Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene,
whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever
was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be
the next target of his terror.</p>
<p>(<i>The bystander effect,</i> thought Harry, thinking of Latane
and Darley's experiment which had shown that you were more likely
to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than
in front of three. <i>Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping
that someone else would go first.</i>)</p>
<p>The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord's wake and in his
vanguard, carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and
weaken. The Death Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but
they were terrible, and they were many. And the Death Eaters
wielded more than wands; there was wealth within those masked
ranks, and political power, and secrets held in blackmail, to
paralyse a society trying to protect itself.</p>
<p>An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for
increased taxes and conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for
the many to cower in fear of the few. His skin, only his skin, had
been found nailed to the newsroom wall that next morning, next to
the skins of his wife and two daughters. Everyone wished for
something more to be done, and no one dared take the lead to
propose it. Whoever stood out the most became the next example.</p>
<p>Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that
list.</p>
<p>And those two might have died with their wands in their hands
and not regretted their choices, for they <i>were</i> heroes; but
for that they had an infant child, their son, Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Tears were coming into Harry's eyes. He wiped them away in anger
or maybe desperation, <i>I didn't know those people, not really,
they aren't my parents</i> now, <i>it would be pointless to feel so
sad for them -</i></p>
<p>When Harry was done sobbing into the witch's robes, he looked
up, and felt a little bit better to see tears in Professor
McGonagall's eyes as well.</p>
<p>"So what happened?" Harry said, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord came to Godric's Hollow," Professor McGonagall
said in a whisper. "You should have been hidden, but you were
betrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he
came in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at
you, and that was where it ended. The Killing Curse is formed of
pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it from the
body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But
you survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing
Curse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt
hulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead. That was the end of
the terror, and we were free. That, Harry Potter, is why people
want to see the scar on your forehead, and why they want to shake
your hand."</p>
<p>The storm of weeping that had washed through Harry had used up
all his tears; he could not cry again, he was done.</p>
<p>(And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note
of confusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it
should have been a part of Harry's art to notice that tiny note,
but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are
most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are
most likely to forget it.)</p>
<p>Harry detached himself from Professor McGonagall's side. "I'll -
have to think about this," he said, trying to keep his voice under
control. He stared at his shoes. "Um. You can go ahead and call
them my parents, if you want, you don't have to say 'genetic
parents' or anything. I guess there's no reason I can't have two
mothers and two fathers."</p>
<p>There was no sound from Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>And they walked together in silence, until they came before a
great white building with vast bronze doors, and carven words above
saying <i>Gringotts Bank.</i></p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="4">Chapter 4</h2><h3>The Efficient Market
Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Disclaimer: J. K. Rowling is watching you from where she waits,
eternally in the void between worlds.</p>
<p>A/N: As others have noted, the novels seem inconsistent in the
apparent purchasing power of a Galleon; I'm picking a consistent
value and sticking with it. Five pounds sterling to the Galleon
doesn't square with seven Galleons for a wand and children using
hand-me-down wands.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it
world optimisation.</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Heaps of gold Galleons. Stacks of silver Sickles. Piles of
bronze Knuts.</p>
<p>Harry stood there, and stared with his mouth open at the family
vault. He had so many questions he didn't know <i>where</i> to
start.</p>
<p>From just outside the door of the vault, Professor McGonagall
watched him, seeming to lean casually against the wall, but her
eyes intent. Well, that made sense. Being plopped in front of a
giant heap of gold coins was a test of character so pure it was
archetypal.</p>
<p>"Are these coins the pure metal?" Harry said finally.</p>
<p>"What?" hissed the goblin Griphook, who was waiting near the
door. "Are you questioning the integrity of Gringotts, Mr.
Potter-Evans-Verres?"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry absently, "not at all, sorry if that came out
wrong, sir. I just have no idea at all how your financial system
works. I'm asking if Galleons in general are made of pure
gold."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Griphook.</p>
<p>"And can anyone coin them, or are they issued by a monopoly that
thereby collects seigniorage?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. "Only a fool would trust
any but goblin coin!"</p>
<p>"In other words," Harry said, "the coins aren't supposed to be
worth any more than the metal making them up?"</p>
<p>Griphook stared at Harry. Professor McGonagall looked
bemused.</p>
<p>"I mean, suppose I came in here with a ton of silver. Could I
get a ton of Sickles made from it?"</p>
<p>"For a fee, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres." The goblin watched him
with glittering eyes. "For a certain fee. Where would you find a
ton of silver, I wonder?"</p>
<p>"I was speaking hypothetically," Harry said. <i>For now, at any
rate.</i> "So... how much would you charge in fees, as a fraction
of the whole weight?"</p>
<p>Griphook's eyes were intent. "I would have to consult my
superiors..."</p>
<p>"Give me a wild guess. I won't hold Gringotts to it."</p>
<p>"A twentieth part of the metal would well pay for the
coining."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Thank you very much, Mr. Griphook."</p>
<p><i>So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely
decoupled from the Muggle economy, no one here has ever heard of
arbitrage.</i> The larger Muggle economy had a fluctuating trading
range of gold to silver, so every time the Muggle gold-to-silver
ratio got more than 5% away from the weight of seventeen Sickles to
one Galleon, either gold or silver should have drained from the
wizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain the
exchange rate. Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay
5%), change the Sickles for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle
world, exchange it for more silver than you started with, and
repeat.</p>
<p>Wasn't the Muggle gold to silver ratio somewhere around fifty to
one? Harry didn't think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked
like the silver coins were actually <i>smaller</i> than the gold
coins.</p>
<p>Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that <i>literally</i>
stored your money in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons,
where you had to go in and take coins out of your vault whenever
you wanted to spend money. The finer points of arbitraging away
market inefficiencies might well be lost on them. He'd been tempted
to make snide remarks about the crudity of their financial
system...</p>
<p><i>But the sad thing is, their way is probably better.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably own
the whole wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this
notion in case he ever ran out of money, or had a week free.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the giant heaps of gold coins within the Potter vault
ought to suit his near-term requirements.</p>
<p>Harry stumped forward, and began picking up gold coins with one
hand and dumping them into the other.</p>
<p>When he had reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. "I
think that will be more than enough to pay for your school
supplies, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Hm?" Harry said, his mind elsewhere. "Hold on, I'm doing a
Fermi calculation."</p>
<p>"A <i>what?</i>" said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat
alarmed.</p>
<p>"It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of
getting rough numbers quickly in your head..."</p>
<p>Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And
gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a
Galleon would be worth about fifty pounds... The mounds of gold
coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in
either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it
would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per
mound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so
forty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.</p>
<p>Not bad. Harry smiled with a certain grim satisfaction. It was
too bad that he was right in the middle of discovering the amazing
new world of magic, and couldn't take time out to explore the
amazing new world of being rich, which a quick Fermi estimate said
was roughly a billion times less interesting.</p>
<p><i>Still, that's the last time I ever mow a lawn for one lousy
pound.</i></p>
<p>Harry wheeled from the giant heap of money. "Pardon me for
asking, Professor McGonagall, but I understand that my parents were
in their twenties when they died. Is this a <i>usual</i> amount of
money for a young couple to have in their vault, in the wizarding
world?" If it was, a cup of tea probably cost five thousand pounds.
Rule one of economics: you can't eat money.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "Your father was the last
heir of an old family, Mr. Potter. It's also possible..." The witch
hesitated. "Some of this money may be from bounties placed on
You-Know-Who, payable to his ki- ah, to whoever might defeat him.
Or those bounties might not have been collected yet. I am not
sure."</p>
<p>"Interesting..." Harry said slowly. "So some of this really is,
in a sense, mine. That is, earned by me. Sort of. Possibly. Even if
I don't remember the occasion." Harry's fingers tapped against his
trouser-leg. "That makes me feel less guilty about spending <i>a
very tiny fraction of it! Don't panic, Professor
McGonagall!</i>"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter! You are a minor, and as such, you will only be
allowed to make <i>reasonable</i> withdrawals from -"</p>
<p>"I am <i>all about</i> reasonable! I am totally on board with
fiscal prudence and impulse control! But I <i>did</i> see some
things on the way here which would constitute <i>sensible,
grown-up</i> purchases..."</p>
<p>Harry locked gazes with Professor McGonagall, engaging in a
silent staring contest.</p>
<p>"Like what?" Professor McGonagall said finally.</p>
<p>"Trunks whose insides hold more than their outsides?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's face grew stern. "Those are <i>very</i>
expensive, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but -" Harry pleaded. "I'm sure that when I'm an adult
I'll want one. And I <i>can</i> afford one. Logically, it would
make just as much sense to buy it now instead of later, and get the
use of it right away. It's the same money either way, right? I
mean, I <i>would</i> want a good one, with <i>lots</i> of room
inside, good enough that I wouldn't have to just get a better one
later..." Harry trailed off hopefully.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's gaze didn't waver. "And just what would
you <i>keep</i> in a trunk like that, Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"Books."</p>
<p>"Of course," sighed Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"You should have told me <i>much earlier</i> that sort of magic
item existed! And that I could afford one! Now my father and I are
going to have to spend the next two days <i>frantically</i> hitting
up all the secondhand bookshops for old textbooks, so I can have a
decent science library with me at Hogwarts - and maybe a small
science fiction collection, if I can assemble something decent out
of the bargain bins. Or better yet, I'll make the deal a little
sweeter for you, okay? Just let me buy -"</p>
<p>"<i>Mr. Potter!</i> You think you can <i>bribe</i> me?"</p>
<p>"What? <i>No!</i> Not like that! I'm saying, Hogwarts can keep
some of the books I bring, if you think that any of them would make
good additions to the library. I'm going to be getting them cheap,
and <i>I</i> just want to have them around somewhere or other. It's
okay to bribe people with <i>books,</i> right? That's a -"</p>
<p>"Family tradition."</p>
<p>"Yes, exactly."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's body seemed to slump, the shoulders
lowering within her black robes. "I cannot deny the sense of your
words, though I much wish I could. I will allow you to withdraw an
additional hundred Galleons, Mr. Potter." She sighed again. "I
<i>know</i> that I shall regret this, and I am doing it
anyway."</p>
<p>"That's the spirit! And does a 'mokeskin pouch' do what I think
it does?"</p>
<p>"It can't do as much as a trunk," the witch said with visible
reluctance, "but... a mokeskin pouch with a Retrieval Charm and
Undetectable Extension Charm can hold a number of items until they
are called forth by the one who emplaced them -"</p>
<p>"Yes! I definitely need one of those too! It would be like the
super beltpack of ultimate awesomeness! Batman's utility belt of
holding! Never mind my swiss army knife, I could carry a whole tool
set in there! Or <i>books!</i> I could have the top three books I
was reading on me at all times, and just pull one out anywhere!
I'll never have to waste another minute of my life! What do you
say, Professor McGonagall? It's for the sake of children's reading,
the best of all possible causes."</p>
<p>"...I suppose you may add another ten Galleons."</p>
<p>Griphook was favouring Harry with a gaze of frank respect,
possibly even outright admiration.</p>
<p>"And a little spending money, like you mentioned earlier. I
think I can remember seeing one or two other things I might want to
store in that pouch."</p>
<p>"<i>Don't push it, Mr. Potter.</i>"</p>
<p>"But oh, Professor McGonagall, why rain on my parade? Surely
this is a <i>happy</i> day, when I discover all things wizarding
for the first time! Why act the part of the grumpy grownup when
instead you could smile and remember your own innocent childhood,
watching the look of delight upon my young face as I buy a few toys
using an insignificant fraction of the wealth that I earned by
defeating the most terrible wizard Britain has ever known, not that
I'm accusing you of being ungrateful or anything, but still, what
are a few toys compared to that?"</p>
<p>"<i>You,</i>" growled Professor McGonagall. There was a look on
her face so fearsome and terrible that Harry squeaked and stepped
back, knocking over a pile of gold coins with a great jingling
noise and sprawling backwards into a heap of money. Griphook sighed
and put a palm over his face. "I would be doing a great service to
wizarding Britain, Mr. Potter, if I locked you in this vault and
left you here."</p>
<p>And they left without any more trouble.</p>

<p>The Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say
cute) ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical
glove shop that was on an alleyway off a side street of Diagon
Alley. Disappointingly, the shopkeeper was not a wizened ancient
crone; just a nervous-looking young woman wearing faded yellow

<p>Harry had <i>insisted</i> on coming here straight away, first

never one to discard an opportunity... though it'd really been more
of a spur-of-the-moment thing. Ever since Harry had been awkwardly
carrying the allowed bag of Galleons next to his trouser pocket, so
that any jingling would seem to come from the right place.</p>
<p>This still left the question of how he was actually going to get
the <i>other</i> coins into the pouch without getting caught. The
golden coins might have been his, but they were still stolen -
self-stolen? Auto-thieved?</p>
<p>Harry looked up from the Moke Super Pouch QX31 on the counter in
front of him. "Can I try this for a bit? To make sure it works, um,
reliably?" He widened his eyes in an expression of boyish, playful
innocence.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after ten repetitions of putting the coin-bag into
the pouch, reaching in, whispering "bag of gold", and taking it
out, Professor McGonagall took a step away and began examining some
of the other items in the shop, and the shopkeeper turned her head
to watch.</p>
<p>Harry dropped the bag of gold into the mokeskin pouch with his
<i>left</i> hand; his <i>right</i> hand came out of his pocket
tightly holding some of the gold coins, reached into the mokeskin
pouch, dropped the loose Galleons, and (with a whisper of "bag of
gold") retrieved the original bag. Then the bag went back into his
<i>left</i> hand, to be dropped in again, and Harry's <i>right</i>
hand went back into his pocket...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked back at him once, but Harry managed
to avoid freezing or flinching, and she didn't seem to notice
anything. Though you never <i>did</i> quite know, with the adults
that had a sense of humour. It took three iterations to get the job
done, and Harry guessed he'd managed to steal maybe thirty Galleons
from himself.</p>
<p>Harry reached up, wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead, and
exhaled. "I'd like this one, please."</p>
<p>Fifteen Galleons lighter (twice the price of a wizard's wand,
apparently) and one Moke Super Pouch QX31 heavier, Harry and
Professor McGonagall pushed their way out of the door. The door
formed a hand and waved goodbye to them as they left, extruding its
arm in a way that made Harry feel a bit queasy.</p>
<p>And then, unfortunately...</p>
<p>"Are you <i>really</i> Harry Potter?" whispered the old man, one
huge tear sliding down his cheek. "You wouldn't lie about that,
would you? Only I'd heard rumours that you didn't <i>really</i>
survive the Killing Curse and that's why no one ever heard from you
again."</p>
<p>...it seemed that Professor McGonagall's disguise spell was less
than perfectly effective against more experienced magical
practitioners.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had laid a hand on Harry's shoulder and
yanked him into the nearest alleyway the moment she'd heard "Harry
Potter?" The old man had followed, but at least it looked like no
one else had heard.</p>
<p>Harry considered the question. <i>Was</i> he really Harry
Potter? "I only know what other people have told me," Harry said.
"It's not like I remember being born." His hand brushed his
forehead. "I've had this scar as long as I remember, and I've been
told my name was Harry Potter as long as I remember. But," Harry
said thoughtfully, "if there's already sufficient cause to
postulate a conspiracy, there's no reason why they wouldn't just
find another orphan and raise him to believe that <i>he</i> was
Harry Potter -"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall drew her hand over her face in
exasperation. "You look just about exactly like your father, James,
the year he first attended Hogwarts. And I can attest on the basis
of <i>personality alone</i> that you are related to the Scourge of
Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"<i>She</i> could be in on it too," Harry observed.</p>
<p>"No," quavered the old man. "She's right. You have your mother's
eyes."</p>
<p>"Hmm," Harry frowned. "I suppose <i>you</i> could be in on it
too -"</p>
<p>"Enough, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>The old man raised up a hand as if to touch Harry, but then let
it fall. "I'm just glad that you're alive," he murmured. "Thank
you, Harry Potter. Thank you for what you did... I'll leave you
alone now."</p>
<p>And his cane slowly tapped away, out the alley and down the main
street of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>The Professor looked around, her expression tense and grim.
Harry automatically looked around himself. But the alley seemed
empty of all but old leaves, and from the mouth leading out into
Diagon Alley, only swiftly striding passersby could be seen.</p>
<p>Finally Professor McGonagall seemed to relax. "That was not well
done," she said in a low voice. "I know you're not used to this,
Mr. Potter, but people do care about you. Please be kind to
them."</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his shoes. "They shouldn't," he said with a
tinge of bitterness. "Care about me, I mean."</p>
<p>"You saved them from You-Know-Who," said Professor McGonagall.
"How should they not care?"</p>
<p>Harry looked up at the witch-lady's strict expression beneath
her pointed hat, and sighed. "I suppose there's no chance that if I
said <i>fundamental attribution error</i> you'd have any idea what
that meant."</p>
<p>"No," said the Professor in her precise Scottish accent, "but
please explain, Mr. Potter, if you would be so kind."</p>
<p>"Well..." Harry said, trying to figure out how to describe that
particular bit of Muggle science. "Suppose you come into work and
see your colleague kicking his desk. You think, 'what an angry
person he must be'. Your colleague is thinking about how someone
bumped him into a wall on the way to work and then shouted at him.
<i>Anyone</i> would be angry at that, he thinks. When we look at
others we see personality traits that explain their behaviour, but
when we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our
behaviour. People's stories make internal sense to them, from the
inside, but we don't see people's histories trailing behind them in
the air. We only see them in one situation, and we don't see what
they would be like in a different situation. So the fundamental
attribution error is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits
what would be better explained by circumstance and context." There
were some elegant experiments which confirmed this, but Harry
wasn't about to go into them.</p>
<p>The witch's eyebrows drew up beneath her hat's brim. "I think I
understand..." Professor McGonagall said slowly. "But what does
that have to do with you?"</p>
<p>Harry kicked the brick wall of the alley hard enough to make his
foot hurt. "People think that I saved them from You-Know-Who
because I'm some kind of great warrior of the Light."</p>
<p>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord..." murmured
the witch, a strange irony leavening her voice.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, annoyance and frustration warring in him,
"like I destroyed the Dark Lord because I have some kind of
permanent, enduring destroy-the-Dark-Lord trait. I was fifteen
months old at the time! I don't <i>know</i> what happened, but I
would <i>suppose</i> it had something to do with, as the saying
goes, contingent environmental circumstances. And certainly nothing
to do with my personality. People don't care about <i>me,</i> they
aren't even paying attention to <i>me,</i> they want to shake hands
with a <i>bad explanation</i>." Harry paused, and looked at
McGonagall. "Do <i>you</i> know what really happened?"</p>
<p>"I <i>have</i> formed an idea..." said Professor McGonagall.
"After meeting you, that is."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"You triumphed over the Dark Lord by being more awful than
<i>he</i> was, and survived the Killing Curse by being more
terrible than Death."</p>
<p>"Ha. Ha. Ha." Harry kicked the wall again.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall chuckled. "Let's get you to Madam Malkin's
next. I fear your Muggle clothing may be attracting attention."</p>
<p>They ran into two more well-wishers along the way.</p>
<p>Madam Malkin's Robes had a genuinely boring shopfront, red
ordinary brick, and glass windows showing plain black robes within.
Not robes that shone or changed or spun, or radiated strange rays
that seemed to go right through your shirt and tickle you. Just
plain black robes, that was all you could see through the window.
The door was propped wide open, as if to advertise that there were
no secrets here and nothing to hide.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go off for a few minutes while you get fitted for
your robes," said Professor McGonagall. "Will you be all right with
that, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. He hated clothes shopping with a fiery passion and
couldn't blame the older witch for feeling the same way.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's wand came out of her sleeve, tapped
Harry's head lightly. "And as you'll need to be clear to Madam
Malkin's senses, I am removing the Obfuscation."</p>
<p>"Uh..." Harry said. That did worry him a little; he still wasn't
used to the 'Harry Potter' thing.</p>
<p>"I went to Hogwarts with Madam Malkin," McGonagall said. "Even
then, she was one of the most <i>composed</i> people I knew. She
wouldn't turn a hair if You-Know-Who himself walked into her shop."
McGonagall's voice was reminiscent, and very approving. "Madam
Malkin won't bother you, and she won't let anyone else bother
you."</p>
<p>"Where <i>are</i> you going?" Harry inquired. "Just in case, you
know, something <i>does</i> happen."</p>
<p>McGonagall gave Harry a hard look. "I am going <i>there,</i>"
she said, pointing at a building across the street which showed the
sign of a wooden keg, "and buying a drink, which I desperately
need. <i>You</i> are to get fitted for your robes, <i>nothing
else</i>. I will come back to check up on you <i>shortly</i>, and I
<i>expect</i> to find Madam Malkin's shop still standing and not in
any way on fire."</p>
<p>Madam Malkin was a bustling old woman who didn't say a word
about Harry when she saw the scar on his forehead, and she shot a
sharp look at an assistant when that girl seemed about to say
something. Madam Malkin got out a set of animated, writhing bits of
cloth that seemed to serve as tape measures and set to work
examining the medium of her art.</p>
<p>Next to Harry, a pale young boy with a pointed face and
<i>awesomecool</i> blonde-white hair seemed to be going through the
final stages of a similar process. One of Malkin's two assistants
was examining the white-haired boy and the chequerboard-gridded
robe he was wearing; occasionally she would tap a corner of the
robe with her wand, and the robe would loosen or tighten.</p>
<p>"Hello," said the boy. "Hogwarts, too?"</p>
<p>Harry could predict where this conversation was about to go, and
he decided in a split second of frustration that enough was
enough.</p>
<p>"Good heavens," whispered Harry, "it couldn't be." He let his
eyes widen. "Your... name, sir?"</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy," said Draco Malfoy, looking slightly puzzled.</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> you! Draco Malfoy. I - I never thought I'd be so
honoured, sir." Harry wished he could make tears come out of his
eyes. The others usually started crying at around this point.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Draco, sounding a little confused. Then his lips
stretched in a smug smile. "It's good to meet someone who knows his
place."</p>
<p>One of the assistants, the one who'd seemed to recognise Harry,
made a muffled choking sound.</p>
<p>Harry burbled on. "I'm delighted to meet you, Mr. Malfoy. Just
unutterably delighted. And to be attending Hogwarts in your very
year! It makes my heart swoon."</p>
<p>Oops. That last part might have sounded a little odd, like he
was flirting with Draco or something.</p>
<p>"And <i>I</i> am pleased to learn that I shall be treated with
the respect due to the family of Malfoy," the other boy lobbed
back, accompanied by a smile such as the highest of kings might
bestow upon the least of his subjects, if that subject were honest,
though poor.</p>
<p>Eh... Damn, Harry was having trouble thinking up his next line.
Well, everyone <i>did</i> want to shake the hand of Harry Potter,
so - "When my clothes are fitted, sir, might you deign to shake my
hand? I should wish nothing more to put the capper upon this day,
nay, this month, indeed, my whole lifetime."</p>
<p>The white-blonde-haired boy glared in return. "And what have
<i>you</i> done for the Malfoys that entitles you to such a
favour?"</p>
<p><i>Oh, I am so totally trying this routine on the next person
who wants to shake my hand.</i> Harry bowed his head. "No, no, sir,
I understand. I'm sorry for asking. I should be honoured to clean
your boots, rather."</p>
<p>"Indeed," snapped the other boy. His stern face lightened
somewhat. "Tell me, what House do you think you might be sorted
into? I'm bound for Slytherin House, of course, like my father
Lucius before me. And for you, I'd guess House Hufflepuff, or
possibly House Elf."</p>
<p>Harry grinned sheepishly. "Professor McGonagall says that I'm
the most Ravenclaw person she's ever seen or heard tell of in
legend, so much so that Rowena herself would tell me to get out
more, whatever <i>that</i> means, and that I'll undoubtedly end up
in Ravenclaw House if the hat isn't screaming too loudly for the
rest of us to make out any words, end quote."</p>
<p>"Wow," said Draco Malfoy, sounding slightly impressed. The boy
gave a sort of wistful sigh. "Your flattery was great, or I thought
so, anyway - you'd do well in Slytherin House, too. Usually it's
only my father who gets that sort of grovelling. I'm <i>hoping</i>
the other Slytherins will suck up to me now I'm at Hogwarts... I
guess this is a good sign, then."</p>
<p>Harry coughed. "Actually, sorry, I've got no idea who you are
really."</p>
<p>"<i>Oh come on!</i>" the boy said with fierce disappointment.
"Why'd you go and do that, then?" Draco's eyes widened with sudden
suspicion. "And how do you <i>not</i> know about the Malfoys? And
what are those <i>clothes</i> you're wearing? Are your parents
<i>Muggles?</i>"</p>
<p>"Two of my parents are dead," Harry said. His heart twinged.
When he put it that way - "My other two parents are Muggles, and
they're the ones that raised me."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Draco. "Who <i>are</i> you?"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, pleased to meet you."</p>
<p>"<i>Harry Potter?</i>" gasped Draco. "<i>The</i> Harry -" and
the boy cut off abruptly.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence.</p>
<p>Then, with bright enthusiasm, "Harry Potter? <i>The</i> Harry
Potter? Gosh, I've always wanted to meet you!"</p>
<p>Draco's attendant emitted a sound like she was strangling but
kept on with her work, lifting Draco's arms to carefully remove the
chequered robe.</p>
<p>"Shut up," Harry suggested.</p>
<p>"Can I have your autograph? No, wait, I want a picture with you
first!"</p>
<p>"Shut<i>up</i>shut<i>up</i>shut<i>up.</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm just so <i>delighted</i> to meet you!"</p>
<p>"Burst into flames and die."</p>
<p>"But you're Harry Potter, the glorious saviour of the wizarding
world! Everyone's hero, Harry Potter! I've always wanted to be just
like you when I grow up so I can -"</p>
<p>Draco cut off the words in mid-sentence, his face freezing in
absolute horror.</p>
<p>Tall, white-haired, coldly elegant in black robes of the finest
quality. One hand gripping a silver-handled cane which took on the
character of a deadly weapon just by being in that hand. His eyes
regarded the room with the dispassionate quality of an executioner,
a man to whom killing was not painful, or even deliciously
forbidden, but just a routine activity like breathing.</p>
<p>That was the man who had, just that moment, strolled in through
the open door.</p>
<p>"Draco," said the man, low and very angry, "<i>what</i> are you
<i>saying?</i>"</p>
<p>In one split second of sympathetic panic, Harry formulated a
rescue plan.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy!" gasped Harry Potter. "<i>The</i> Lucius
Malfoy?"</p>
<p>One of Malkin's assistants had to turn away and face the
wall.</p>
<p>Coolly murderous eyes regarded him. "Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I am so, so honoured to meet you!"</p>
<p>The dark eyes widened, shocked surprise replacing deadly
threat.</p>
<p>"Your son has been telling me <i>all</i> about you," Harry
gushed on, hardly even knowing what was coming out of his mouth but
just talking as fast as possible. "But of course I knew about you
all before then, everyone knows about you, the great Lucius Malfoy!
The most honoured laureate of all the House of Slytherin, I've been
thinking about trying to get into Slytherin House myself just
because I heard you were in it as a child -"</p>
<p>"<i>What are you saying, Mr. Potter?</i>" came a near-scream
from outside the shop, and Professor McGonagall burst in a second
later.</p>
<p>There was such pure horror on her face that Harry's mouth opened
automatically, and then blocked on nothing-to-say.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall!" cried Draco. "Is it really you? I've
heard so much about you from my father, I've been thinking of
trying to get Sorted into Gryffindor so I can -"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" bellowed Lucius Malfoy and Professor McGonagall
in perfect unison, standing side-by-side. Their heads swivelled to
look at each other in duplicate motions, and then the two recoiled
from one another as though performing a synchronised dance.</p>
<p>There was a sudden flurry of action as Lucius seized Draco and
dragged him out of the shop.</p>
<p>And then there was silence.</p>
<p>In Professor McGonagall's left hand lay a small drinking-glass,
tilted over to one side in the forgotten rush, now slowly dripping
drops of alcohol into the tiny puddle of red wine that had appeared
on the floor.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall strode forward into the shop until she was
opposite Madam Malkin.</p>
<p>"Madam Malkin," said Professor McGonagall, her voice calm. "What
has been happening here?"</p>
<p>Madam Malkin looked back silently for four seconds, and then
cracked up. She fell against the wall, wheezing out laughter, and
that set off both of her assistants, one of whom fell to her hands
and knees on the floor, giggling hysterically.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall slowly turned to look at Harry, her
expression chilly. "I leave you alone for six minutes. Six minutes,
Mr. Potter, by the very clock."</p>
<p>"I was only joking around," Harry protested, as the sounds of
hysterical laughter went on nearby.</p>
<p>"<i>Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to
be sorted into Gryffindor!</i> Joking around <i>isn't enough</i> to
<i>do</i> that!" Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking
breaths. "What part of 'get fitted for robes' sounded to you like
<i>please cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!</i>"</p>
<p>"He was in a situational context where those actions made
internal sense -"</p>
<p>"No. Don't explain. I don't want to know what happened in here,
ever. Whatever dark power inhabits you, it is <i>contagious,</i>
and I don't want to end up like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam
Malkin and her two poor assistants."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. It was clear that Professor McGonagall wasn't in a
mood to listen to reasonable explanations. He looked at Madam
Malkin, who was still wheezing against the wall, and Malkin's two
assistants, who had now <i>both</i> fallen to their knees, and
finally down at his own tape-measure-draped body.</p>
<p>"I'm not quite done being fitted for clothes," Harry said
kindly. "Why don't you go back and have another drink?"</p>

<p><i>Some</i> children would have waited until <i>after</i> their

<p>"Bag of element 79," Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty,
from the mokeskin pouch.</p>
<p>Most children would have at least waited to get their
<i>wands</i> first.</p>
<p>"Bag of <i>okane,</i>" said Harry. The heavy bag of gold popped
up into his hand.</p>
<p>Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskin
pouch. He took out his hand, put it back in, and said, "Bag of
tokens of economic exchange." That time his hand came out
empty.</p>
<p>"Give me back the bag that I just put in." Out came the bag of
gold once more.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had gotten his hands on at least
one magical item. Why wait?</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall," Harry said to the bemused witch
strolling beside him, "can you give me two words, one word for
gold, and one word for something else that isn't money, in a
language that I wouldn't know? But don't tell me which is
which."</p>
<p>"<i>Ahava</i> and <i>zahav,</i>" said Professor McGonagall.
"That's Hebrew, and the other word means love."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Professor. Bag of <i>ahava.</i>" Empty.</p>
<p>"Bag of <i>zahav.</i>" And it popped up into his hand.</p>
<p>"Zahav is gold?" Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall
nodded.</p>
<p>Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only
the most crude and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to
support at least one conclusion:</p>
<p>"<i>Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn't make any sense!</i>"</p>
<p>The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. "Problems, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know
that 'bag of 115 Galleons' is okay but not 'bag of 90 plus 25
Galleons'? It can <i>count</i> but it can't <i>add?</i> It can
understand nouns, but not some noun phrases that mean the same
thing? The person who made this probably didn't speak Japanese and
<i>I</i> don't speak any Hebrew, so it's not using <i>their</i>
knowledge, and it's not using <i>my</i> knowledge -" Harry waved a
hand helplessly. "The rules seem <i>sorta</i> consistent but they
don't <i>mean</i> anything! I'm not even going to ask how a
<i>pouch</i> ends up with voice recognition and natural language
understanding when the best Artificial Intelligence programmers
can't get the fastest supercomputers to do it after thirty-five
years of hard work," Harry gasped for breath, "but <i>what</i> is
going <i>on?</i>"</p>
<p>"Magic," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"That's just a <i>word!</i> Even after you tell me that, I can't
make any new predictions! It's exactly like saying 'phlogiston' or
'elan vital' or 'emergence' or 'complexity'!"</p>
<p>The black-robed witch laughed aloud. "But it <i>is</i> magic,
Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry slumped over a little. "With respect, Professor
McGonagall, I'm not quite sure you understand what I'm trying to do
here."</p>
<p>"With respect, Mr. Potter, I'm quite sure I don't. Unless - this
is just a guess, mind - you're trying to take over the world?"</p>
<p>"No! I mean yes - well, <i>no!</i>"</p>
<p>"I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble
answering the question."</p>
<p>Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial
Intelligence in 1956. It had been the first conference ever on the
topic, the one that had coined the phrase "Artificial
Intelligence". They had identified key problems such as making
computers understand language, learn, and improve themselves. They
had suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on
these problems might be made by ten scientists working together for
two months.</p>
<p><i>No. Chin up. You're just</i> starting <i>on the problem of
unravelling all the secrets of magic. You don't actually</i> know
<i>whether it's going to be too difficult to do in two
months.</i></p>
<p>"And you <i>really</i> haven't heard of other wizards asking
these sorts of questions or doing this sort of scientific
experimenting?" Harry asked again. It just seemed so <i>obvious</i>
to him.</p>
<p>Then again, it'd taken more than two hundred years <i>after</i>
the invention of the scientific method before any Muggle scientists
had thought to systematically investigate which sentences a
<i>human four-year-old</i> could or couldn't understand. The
developmental psychology of linguistics could've been discovered in
the eighteenth century, in principle, but no one had even thought
to look until the twentieth. So you couldn't really blame the much
smaller wizarding world for not investigating the Retrieval
Charm.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. "I'm still
not sure what you mean by 'scientific experimenting', Mr. Potter.
As I said, I've seen Muggleborn students try to get Muggle science
to work inside Hogwarts, and people invent new Charms and Potions
every year."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. "Technology isn't the same thing as
science at all. And trying lots of different ways to do something
isn't the same as experimenting to figure out the rules." There
were plenty of people who'd tried to invent flying machines by
trying out lots of things-with-wings, but only the Wright Brothers
had built a wind tunnel to measure lift... "Um, how many
Muggle-raised children <i>do</i> you get at Hogwarts every
year?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps ten or so?"</p>
<p>Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet.
"<i>Ten?</i>"</p>
<p>The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting.
If you were one in a million, there were seven of you in London and
a thousand more in China. It was inevitable that the Muggle
population would produce <i>some</i> eleven-year-olds who could do
calculus - Harry knew he wasn't the only one. He'd met other
prodigies in mathematical competitions. In fact he'd been
thoroughly trounced by competitors who probably spent literally
<i>all day</i> practising maths problems and who'd <i>never</i>
read a science-fiction book and who would burn out
<i>completely</i> before <i>puberty</i> and <i>never</i> amount to
<i>anything</i> in their future lives because they'd just practised
<i>known</i> techniques instead of learning to think
<i>creatively</i>. (Harry was something of a sore loser.)</p>
<p>But... in the wizarding world...</p>
<p>Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who'd all ended their
Muggle educations at the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall
might be biased, but she had claimed that Hogwarts was the largest
and most eminent wizarding school in the world... and it only
educated up to the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how
you went about turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally
never <i>heard</i> of the scientific method. To her it was just
Muggle magic. And she didn't even seem <i>curious</i> about what
secrets might be hiding behind the natural language understanding
of the Retrieval Charm.</p>
<p>That left two possibilities, really.</p>
<p>Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and
impenetrable, that even though wizards and witches had tried their
best to understand, they'd made little or no progress and
eventually given up; and Harry would do no better.</p>
<p><i>Or</i>...</p>
<p>Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made
a quiet sort of clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off
the walls of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Possibility two: He'd be taking over the world.</p>
<p>Eventually. Perhaps not right away.</p>
<p>That sort of thing <i>did</i> sometimes take longer than two
months. Muggle science hadn't gone to the moon in the first week
after Galileo.</p>
<p>But Harry still couldn't stop the huge smile that was stretching
his cheeks so wide they were starting to hurt.</p>
<p>Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those
child prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest
of their lives boasting about how far ahead they'd been at age ten.
But then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either.
There were probably a thousand people as intelligent as Einstein
for every actual Einstein in history. Because those other geniuses
hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed to
achieve greatness. They'd never found an important problem.</p>
<p><i>You're mine now,</i> Harry thought at the walls of Diagon
Alley, and all the shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and
customers; and all the lands and people of wizarding Britain, and
all the wider wizarding world; and the entire greater universe of
which Muggle scientists understood so much less than they believed.
<i>I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do now claim this territory
in the name of Science.</i></p>
<p>Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in the
cloudless skies.</p>
<p>"What are you smiling about?" inquired Professor McGonagall,
warily and wearily.</p>
<p>"I'm wondering if there's a spell to make lightning flash in the
background whenever I make an ominous resolution," explained Harry.
He was carefully memorising the exact words of his ominous
resolution so that future history books would get it right.</p>
<p>"I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something
about this," sighed Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Ignore it, it'll go away. Ooh, shiny!" Harry put his thoughts
of world conquest temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop
with an open display, and Professor McGonagall followed.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry had now bought his potions ingredients and cauldron, and,
oh, a few more things. Items that seemed like good things to carry
in Harry's Bag of Holding (aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 with
Undetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm, and Widening Lip).
Smart, sensible purchases.</p>
<p>Harry genuinely didn't understand why Professor McGonagall was
looking so <i>suspicious</i>.</p>
<p>Right now, Harry was in a shop expensive enough to display in
the twisting main street of Diagon Alley. The shop had an open
front with merchandise laid out on slanted wooden rows, guarded
only by slight grey glows and a young-looking salesgirl in a
much-shortened version of witch's robes that exposed her knees and
elbows.</p>
<p>Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit,
the Emergency Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening
tourniquets. A Stabilisation Potion, which would slow blood loss
and prevent shock. A syringe of what looked like liquid fire, which
was supposed to drastically slow circulation in a treated area
while maintaining oxygenation of the blood for up to three minutes,
if you needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the body.
White cloth that could be wrapped over a part of the body to
temporarily numb pain. Plus any number of other items that Harry
totally failed to comprehend, like the "Dementor Exposure
Treatment", which looked and smelled like ordinary chocolate. Or
the "Bafflesnaffle Counter", which looked like a small quivering
egg and carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone's
nostril.</p>
<p>"A definite buy at five Galleons, wouldn't you agree?" Harry
said to Professor McGonagall, and the teenage salesgirl hovering
nearby nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>Harry had expected the Professor to make some sort of approving
remark about his prudence and preparedness.</p>
<p>What he was getting instead could only be described as the Evil
Eye.</p>
<p>"And just <i>why</i>," Professor McGonagall said with heavy
scepticism, "do you expect to <i>need</i> a healer's kit, young
man?" (After the unfortunate incident at the Potions shop,
Professor McGonagall was trying to avoid saying "Mr. Potter" while
anyone else was nearby.)</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened and closed. "I don't <i>expect</i> to need
it! It's just in case!"</p>
<p>"Just in case of <i>what?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened. "You think I'm <i>planning</i> to do
something dangerous and <i>that's</i> why I want a medical
kit?"</p>
<p>A look of grim suspicion and ironic disbelief was the
answer.</p>
<p>"Great Scott!" said Harry. (This was an expression he'd learned
from the mad scientist Doc Brown in <i>Back to the Future</i>.)
"Were you also thinking that when I bought the Feather-Falling
Potion, the Gillyweed, and the bottle of Food and Water Pills?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head in amazement. "Just what sort of plan do
you think I have <i>going</i>, here?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Professor McGonagall said darkly, "but it ends
either in you delivering a ton of silver to Gringotts, or in world
domination."</p>
<p>"World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it
world optimisation."</p>
<p>This hilarious joke failed to reassure the witch giving him the
Look of Doom.</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry said, as he realised that she was serious. "You
really think that. You really think I'm planning to do something
dangerous."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Like that's the <i>only</i> reason anyone would ever buy a
first-aid kit? Don't take this the wrong way, Professor McGonagall,
but <i>what sort of crazy children are you used to dealing
with</i>?"</p>
<p>"Gryffindors," spat Professor McGonagall, the word carrying a
freight of bitterness and despair that fell like an eternal curse
on all youthful enthusiasm and high spirits.</p>
<p>"Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall," Harry said,
putting his hands sternly on his hips. "I am not going to be in
Gryffindor -"</p>
<p>At this point the Deputy Headmistress interjected something
about how if he <i>was</i> she would figure out how to kill a hat,
which odd remark Harry let pass without comment, though the
salesgirl seemed to be having a sudden coughing fit.</p>
<p>"- I am going to be in Ravenclaw. And if you really think that
I'm planning to do something dangerous, then, honestly, you don't
understand me <i>at all.</i> I don't <i>like</i> danger, it is
<i>scary.</i> I am being <i>prudent</i>. I am being
<i>cautious</i>. I am preparing for <i>unforeseen
contingencies</i>. Like my parents used to sing to me: <i>Be
prepared! That's the Boy Scout's marching song! Be prepared! As
through life you march along! Don't be nervous, don't be flustered,
don't be scared - be prepared!</i>"</p>
<p>(Harry's parents had in fact only ever sung him those
<i>particular</i> lines of that Tom Lehrer song, and Harry was
blissfully unaware of the rest.)</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's stance had slightly softened - though
mostly when Harry had said that he was heading for Ravenclaw. "What
sort of <i>contingency</i> do you imagine this kit might prepare
you for, <i>young man?</i>"</p>
<p>"One of my classmates gets bitten by a horrible monster, and as
I scrabble frantically in my mokeskin pouch for something that
could help her, she looks at me sadly and with her last breath
says, <i>'Why weren't you prepared?'</i> And then she dies, and I
know as her eyes close that she won't ever forgive me -"</p>
<p>Harry heard the salesgirl gasp, and he looked up to see her
staring at him with her lips pressed tight. Then the young woman
whirled and fled into the deeper recesses of the shop.</p>
<p><i>What...?</i></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall reached down, and took Harry's hand in
hers, gently but firmly, and pulled Harry out of the main street of
Diagon Alley, leading him into an alleyway between two shops which
was paved in dirty bricks and dead-ended in a wall of solid black
dirt.</p>
<p>The tall witch pointed her wand at the main street and spoke,
<i>"Quietus</i>" she said, and a screen of silence descended around
them, blocking out all the street noises.</p>
<p><i>What did I do wrong...</i></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn't have a
full adult Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat,
controlled. "You must remember, Mr. Potter," she said, "that there
was a war in this country not ten years ago. Everyone has lost
someone, and to speak of friends dying in your arms - is not done
lightly."</p>
<p>"I - I didn't mean to -" The inference dropped like a falling
stone into Harry's exceptionally vivid imagination. He'd talked
about someone breathing their last breath - and then the salesgirl
had run away - and the war had ended ten years ago so that girl
would have been at most eight or nine years old, when, when, "I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to..." Harry choked up, and turned away to run
from the older witch's gaze but there was a wall of dirt blocking
his way and he didn't have his wand yet. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
<i>sorry!</i>"</p>
<p>There came a heavy sigh from behind him. "I know you are, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>Harry dared to peek behind him. Professor McGonagall only seemed
sad, now. "I'm sorry," Harry said again, feeling wretched. "Did
anything like that happen to -" and then Harry shut his lips and
slapped a hand over his mouth for good measure.</p>
<p>The older witch's face grew a little sadder. "You must learn to
think before you speak, Mr. Potter, or else go through life without
many friends. That has been the fate of many a Ravenclaw, and I
hope it will not be yours."</p>
<p>Harry wanted to just run away. He wanted to pull out a wand and
erase the whole thing from Professor McGonagall's memory, be back
with her outside the shop again, <i>make it didn't happen -</i></p>
<p>"But to answer your question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like
<i>that</i> has ever happened to me. Certainly I've watched a
friend breathe their last, once or seven times. But not one of them
ever cursed me as they died, and I never thought that they wouldn't
forgive me. Why would you <i>say</i> such a thing, Mr. Potter? Why
would you even <i>think</i> it?"</p>
<p>"I, I, I," Harry swallowed. "It's just that I always try to
imagine the worst thing that could happen," and maybe he'd also
been joking around a little but he would rather have bitten off his
own tongue than say that now.</p>
<p>"What?" said Professor McGonagall. "But <i>why?"</i></p>
<p>"So I can stop it from happening!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter..." the older witch's voice trailed off. Then she
sighed, and knelt down beside him. "Mr. Potter," she said, gently
now, "it's not your responsibility to take care of the students at
Hogwarts. It's mine. I won't let anything bad happen to you or
anyone else. Hogwarts is the safest place for magical children in
all the wizarding world, and Madam Pomfrey has a full healer's
office. You won't need a healer's kit at all, let alone a
five-Galleon one."</p>
<p>"But I <i>do!</i>" Harry burst out. "<i>Nowhere</i> is
perfectly safe! And what if my parents have a heart attack or get
in an accident when I go home for Christmas - Madam Pomfrey won't
be there, I'll need a healer's kit of my own -"</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> in Merlin's name..." Professor McGonagall said. She
stood up, and looked down at Harry an expression torn between
annoyance and concern. "There's no need to think about such
terrible things, Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>Harry's expression twisted up into bitterness, hearing that.
"Yes there <i>is!</i> If you don't think, you don't just get hurt
yourself, you end up hurting other people!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, then closed it. The witch
rubbed the bridge of her nose, looking thoughtful. "Mr. Potter...
if I were to offer to listen to you for a while... is there
anything you'd like to talk to me about?"</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About why you're convinced you must always be on your guard
against terrible things happening to you."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her in puzzlement. That was a self-evident
axiom. "Well..." Harry said slowly. He tried to organise his
thoughts. How <i>could</i> he explain himself to a Professor-witch,
when she didn't even know the basics? "Muggle researchers have
found that people are always very optimistic, compared to reality.
Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days,
or they say it'll take two months and it takes over thirty-five
years. For example, in one experiment, they asked students for
times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99% sure they'd
complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of the students
finished by those times. And they found that the reason was that
when they asked one group for their best-case estimates if
everything went as well as possible, and another group for their
average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they got back
answers that were statistically indistinguishable. See, if you ask
someone what they expect in the <i>normal</i> case, they visualise
what looks like the line of maximum probability at each step along
the way - everything going according to plan, with no surprises.
But actually, since more than half the students didn't finish by
the time they were 99% sure they'd be done, reality usually
delivers results a little worse than the 'worst-case scenario'.
It's called the planning fallacy, and the best way to fix it is to
ask how long things took the last time you tried them. That's
called using the outside view instead of the inside view. But when
you're doing something new and can't do that, you just have to be
really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that
reality actually comes out <i>better</i> than you expected around
as often and as much as it comes out worse. It's actually <i>really
hard</i> to be <i>so</i> pessimistic that you stand a decent chance
of <i>undershooting</i> real life. Like I make this big effort to
be gloomy and I imagine one of my classmates getting bitten, but
what actually happens is that the surviving Death Eaters attack the
whole school to get at me. But on a happier note -"</p>
<p>"Stop," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry stopped. He had just been about to point out that at least
they knew the Dark Lord wouldn't attack, since he was dead.</p>
<p>"I think I might not have made myself clear," the witch said,
her precise Scottish voice sounding even more careful. "Did
anything happen to <i>you personally</i> that frightened you, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"What happened to me personally is only anecdotal evidence,"
Harry explained. "It doesn't carry the same weight as a replicated,
peer-reviewed journal article about a controlled study with random
assignment, many subjects, large effect sizes and strong
statistical significance."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled,
and exhaled. "I would still like to hear about it," she said.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. He took a deep breath. "There'd been some
muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a
pan she'd borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I
didn't want to because I might get mugged, and she said, 'Harry,
don't say things like that!' Like thinking about it would
<i>make</i> it happen, so if I didn't talk about it, I would be
safe. I tried to explain why I wasn't reassured, and she made me
carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how
statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was
old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesn't stop
it from happening, so I was really scared."</p>
<p>"Nothing else?" Professor McGonagall said after a pause, when it
became clear that Harry was done. "There isn't anything <i>else</i>
that happened to you?"</p>
<p>"I know it doesn't <i>sound</i> like much," Harry defended. "But
it was just one of those critical life moments, you see? I mean, I
<i>knew</i> that not thinking about something doesn't stop it from
happening, I <i>knew</i> that, but I could see that Mum really
thought that way." Harry stopped, struggling with the anger that
was starting to rise up again when he thought about it. "She
<i>wouldn't listen</i>. I tried to tell her, I <i>begged</i> her
not to send me out, and she <i>laughed it off</i>. Everything I
said, she treated like some sort of big joke..." Harry forced the
black rage back down again. "That's when I realised that everyone
who was supposed to protect me was actually crazy, and that they
wouldn't listen to me no matter how much I begged them, and that I
couldn't ever rely on them to get anything right." Sometimes good
intentions weren't enough, sometimes you had to be sane...</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>Harry took the time to breathe deeply and calm himself down.
There was no point in getting angry. There was no point in getting
angry. <i>All</i> parents were like that, <i>no</i> adult would
lower themselves far enough to place themselves on level ground
with a child and listen, his genetic parents would have been no
different. Sanity was a tiny spark in the night, an infinitesimally
rare exception to the rule of madness, so there was no point in
getting angry.</p>
<p>Harry didn't like himself when he was angry.</p>
<p>"Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Potter," said Professor
McGonagall after a while. There was an abstracted look on her face
(almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face
while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in
a mirror to realise that). "I shall have to think about this." She
turned towards the alley mouthway, and raised her wand -</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said, "can we go get the healer's kit now?"</p>
<p>The witch paused, and looked back at him steadily. "And if I say
no - that it is too expensive and you won't need it - then
what?"</p>
<p>Harry's face twisted in bitterness. "Exactly what you're
thinking, Professor McGonagall. <i>Exactly</i> what you're
thinking. I conclude you're another crazy adult I can't talk to,
and I start planning how to get my hands on a healer's kit
anyway."</p>
<p>"I am your guardian on this trip," Professor McGonagall said
with a tinge of danger. "I <i>will not</i> allow you to push me
around."</p>
<p>"I understand," Harry said. He kept the resentment out of his
voice, and didn't say any of the other things that came to mind.
Professor McGonagall had told him to think before he spoke. He
probably wouldn't remember that tomorrow, but he could at least
remember it for five minutes.</p>
<p>The witch's wand made a slight circle in her hand, and the
noises of Diagon Alley came back. "All right, young man," she said.
"Let's go get that healer's kit."</p>
<p>Harry's jaw dropped in surprise. Then he hurried after her,
almost stumbling in his sudden rush.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and
unrecognisable items still laid out on the slanted wooden display,
the grey glow still protecting and the salesgirl back in her old
position. The salesgirl looked up as they approached, her face
showing surprise.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at
almost the same moment, "I apologise for -"</p>
<p>They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirl
laughed a little. "I didn't mean to get you in trouble with
Professor McGonagall," she said. Her voice lowered
conspiratorially. "I hope she wasn't <i>too</i> awful to you."</p>
<p>"<i>Della!</i>" said Professor McGonagall, sounding
scandalised.</p>
<p>"Bag of gold," Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up
at the salesgirl while he counted out five Galleons. "Don't worry,
I understand that she's only awful to me because she loves me."</p>
<p>He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor
McGonagall was spluttering something unimportant. "One Emergency
Healing Pack Plus, please."</p>
<p>It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip
swallowed the briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn't help
wondering what would happen if he tried climbing into the mokeskin
pouch himself, given that only the person who put something in was
supposed to be able to take it out again.</p>
<p>When the pouch was done... eating... his hard-won purchase,
Harry swore he heard a small burping sound afterward. That
<i>had</i> to have been spelled in on purpose. The alternative
hypothesis was too horrifying to contemplate... in fact Harry
couldn't even <i>think</i> of any alternative hypotheses. Harry
looked back up at the Professor, as they began walking through
Diagon Alley once more. "Where to next?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it
had been made from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur
instead of paint. "Small pets are permitted at Hogwarts - you could
get an owl to send letters, for example -"</p>
<p>"Can I pay a Knut or something and <i>rent</i> an owl when I
need to send mail?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Then I think emphatically <i>no.</i>"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point.
"Might I ask why not?"</p>
<p>"I had a pet rock once. It died."</p>
<p>"You don't think you could take care of a pet?"</p>
<p>"I <i>could,</i>" Harry said, "but I would end up obsessing all
day long about whether I'd remembered to feed it that day or if it
was slowly starving in its cage, wondering where its master was and
why there wasn't any food."</p>
<p>"That poor owl," the older witch said in a soft voice.
"Abandoned like that. I wonder what it would do."</p>
<p>"Well, I expect it'd get really hungry and start trying to claw
its way out of the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably
wouldn't have much luck with that -" Harry stopped short.</p>
<p>The witch went on, still in that soft voice. "And what would
happen to it afterward?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor
McGonagall by the hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet
another alleyway; after ducking so many well-wishers the process
had become almost unnoticeably routine. "Please cast that silencing
spell."</p>
<p>"<i>Quietus.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's voice was shaking. "That owl does <i>not</i> represent
me, my parents <i>never</i> locked me in a cupboard and left me to
starve, I do <i>not</i> have abandonment fears and I <i>don't like
the trend of your thoughts, Professor McGonagall!</i>"</p>
<p>The witch looked down at him gravely. "And what thoughts would
those be, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"You think I was," Harry was having trouble saying it, "I was
<i>abused?</i>"</p>
<p>"Were you?"</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" Harry shouted. "No, I never was! Do you think I'm
<i>stupid?</i> I <i>know</i> about the concept of child abuse, I
<i>know</i> about inappropriate touching and all of that and if
anything like that happened I would call the police! And report it
to the head teacher! And look up social services in the phone book!
And tell Grandpa and Grandma and Mrs. Figg! But my parents
<i>never</i> did anything like that, never ever <i>ever!</i> How
<i>dare</i> you suggest such a thing!"</p>
<p>The older witch gazed at him steadily. "It is my duty as Deputy
Headmistress to investigate possible signs of abuse in the children
under my care."</p>
<p>Harry's anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black
fury. "Don't you ever <i>dare</i> breathe a word of these, these
<i>insinuations</i> to anyone else! <i>No one</i>, do you hear me,
McGonagall? An accusation like that can ruin people and destroy
families even when the parents are completely innocent! I've read
about it in the newspapers!" Harry's voice was climbing to a
high-pitched scream. "The <i>system</i> doesn't know how to
<i>stop</i>, it doesn't believe the parents <i>or</i> the children
when they say nothing happened! <i>Don't you dare threaten my
family with that! I won't let you destroy my home!</i>"</p>
<p>"Harry," the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand
towards him -</p>
<p>Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knocked
hers away.</p>
<p>McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a step
backwards. "Harry, it's all right," she said. "I believe you."</p>
<p>"<i>Do you,</i>" Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through
his blood. "Or are you just waiting to get away from me so you can
file the papers?"</p>
<p>"Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love
you. You love them. I do believe you when you say that your parents
are not abusing you. But I <i>had</i> to ask, because there is
something strange at work here."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her coldly. "Like what?"</p>
<p>"Harry, I've seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts,
it would break your heart to know how many. And, when you're happy,
you don't behave like one of those children, not at <i>all</i>. You
smile at strangers, you hug people, I put my hand on your shoulder
and you didn't flinch. But sometimes, only sometimes, you say or do
something that seems <i>very</i> much like... someone who spent his
first eleven years locked in a cellar. Not the loving family that I
saw." Professor McGonagall tilted her head, her expression growing
puzzled again.</p>
<p>Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain
away, as it dawned on him that he was being listened to
respectfully, and that his family wasn't in danger.</p>
<p>"And how <i>do</i> you explain your observations, Professor
McGonagall?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said. "But it's possible that something
could have happened to you that you don't remember."</p>
<p>Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what
he'd read in the newspaper stories of shattered families.
"Suppressed memory is a load of <i>pseudoscience!</i> People do
<i>not</i> repress traumatic memories, they remember them all
<i>too</i> well for the rest of their lives!"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation."</p>
<p>Harry froze in place. "A spell that erases memories?"</p>
<p>The older witch nodded. "But not all the effects of the
experience, if you see what I'm saying, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>A chill went down Harry's spine. <i>That</i> hypothesis... could
<i>not</i> be easily refuted. "But my parents couldn't do
that!"</p>
<p>"Indeed not," said Professor McGonagall. "It would have taken
someone from the wizarding world. There's... no way to be certain,
I'm afraid."</p>
<p>Harry's rationalist skills began to boot up again. "Professor
McGonagall, how sure are you of your observations, and what
alternative explanations could there also be?"</p>
<p>The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness.
"Sure? I'm sure of <i>nothing</i>, Mr. Potter. In all my life I've
never met anyone else like you. Sometimes you just don't seem
eleven years old or even all that <i>human</i>."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows rose toward the sky -</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" Professor McGonagall said quickly. "I'm very sorry,
Mr. Potter. I was trying to make a point and I'm afraid that came
out sounding different from what I had in mind -"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, Professor McGonagall," Harry said, and slowly
smiled. "I shall take it as a very great compliment. But would you
mind if I offered an alternative explanation?"</p>
<p>"Please do."</p>
<p>"Children aren't meant to be too much smarter than their
parents," Harry said. "Or too much saner, maybe - my father could
probably outsmart me if he was, you know, actually <i>trying,</i>
instead of using his adult intelligence mainly to come up with new
reasons not to change his mind -" Harry stopped. "I'm too smart,
Professor. I've got nothing to say to normal children. Adults don't
respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they
did, they wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as
well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. I'm
<i>isolated</i>, Professor McGonagall. I've been isolated my whole
life. Maybe that has some of the same effects as being locked in a
cellar. And I'm too intelligent to look up to my parents the way
that children are designed to do. My parents love me, but they
don't feel obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like
they're the children - children who <i>won't listen</i> and have
absolute authority over my whole existence. I try not to be too
bitter about it, but I also try to be <i>honest</i> with myself,
so, yes, I'm bitter. And I also have an anger management problem,
but I'm working on it. That's all."</p>
<p>"<i>That's all?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry nodded firmly. "That's all. Surely, Professor McGonagall,
even in magical Britain, the normal explanation is always worth
<i>considering?</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was later in the day, the sun lowering in the summer sky and
shoppers beginning to peter out from the streets. Some shops had
already closed; Harry and Professor McGonagall had bought his
textbooks from Flourish and Blotts just under the deadline. With
only a slight explosion when Harry had made a beeline for the
keyword "Arithmancy" and discovered that the seventh-year textbooks
invoked nothing more mathematically advanced than trigonometry.</p>
<p>At this moment, though, dreams of low-hanging research fruit
were far from Harry's mind.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two of them were walking out of
Ollivander's, and Harry was staring at his wand. He'd waved it, and
produced multicoloured sparks, which really shouldn't have come as
such an extra shock after everything else he'd seen, but somehow
-</p>
<p><i>I can do magic.</i></p>
<p><i>Me. As in, me personally. I am magical; I am a
wizard.</i></p>
<p>He had <i>felt</i> the magic pouring up his arm, and in that
instant, realised that he had always had that sense, that he had
possessed it his whole life, the sense that was not sight or sound
or smell or taste or touch but only magic. Like having eyes but
keeping them always closed, so that you didn't even realise that
you were seeing darkness; and then one day the eye opened, and saw
the world. The shock of it had poured through him, touching pieces
of himself, awakening them, and then died away in seconds; leaving
only the certain knowledge that he was now a wizard, and always had
been, and had even, in some strange way, always known it.</p>
<p>And -</p>
<p><i>"It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for
this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that
scar."</i></p>
<p>That could not <i>possibly</i> be coincidence. There had been
<i>thousands</i> of wands in that shop. Well, okay, actually it
<i>could</i> be coincidence, there were six billion people in the
world and thousand-to-one coincidences happened every day. But
Bayes's Theorem said that any reasonable hypothesis which made it
<i>more</i> likely than a thousand-to-one that he'd end up with the
brother to the Dark Lord's wand, was going to have an
advantage.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had simply said <i>how peculiar</i> and
left it at that, which had put Harry into a state of shock at the
sheer, overwhelming <i>uncuriosity</i> of wizards and witches. In
no <i>imaginable</i> world would Harry have just went "Hm" and
walked out of the shop without even <i>trying</i> to come up with a
hypothesis for what was going on.</p>
<p>His left hand rose and touched his scar.</p>
<p>What... <i>exactly...</i></p>
<p>"You're a full wizard now," said Professor McGonagall.
"Congratulations."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"And what do you think of the wizarding world?" said she.</p>
<p>"It's strange," Harry said. "I ought to be thinking about
everything I've seen of magic... everything that I now know is
possible, and everything I now know to be a lie, and all the work
left before me to understand it. And yet I find myself distracted
by relative trivialities like," Harry lowered his voice, "the whole
Boy-Who-Lived thing." There didn't seem to be anyone nearby, but no
point tempting fate.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall <i>ahemmed</i>. "Really? You don't
say."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Yes. It's just... <i>odd.</i> To find out that
you were part of this grand story, the quest to defeat the great
and terrible Dark Lord, and it's already <i>done.</i> Finished.
Completely over with. Like you're Frodo Baggins and you find out
that your parents took you to Mount Doom and had you toss in the
Ring when you were one year old and you don't even remember
it."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's smile had grown somewhat fixed.</p>
<p>"You know, if I were anyone else, anyone else at all, I'd
probably be pretty worried about living up to that start. <i>Gosh,
Harry, what have you done since you defeated the Dark Lord? Your
own bookshop? That's great! Say, did you know I named my child
after you?</i> But I have hopes that this will not prove to be a
problem." Harry sighed. "Still... it's almost enough to make me
wish that there were <i>some</i> loose ends from the quest, just so
I could say that I really, you know, <i>participated</i>
somehow."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor McGonagall in an odd tone. "What did you
have in mind?"</p>
<p>"Well, for example, you mentioned that my parents were betrayed.
Who betrayed them?"</p>
<p>"Sirius Black," the witch said, almost hissing the name. "He's
in Azkaban. Wizarding prison."</p>
<p>"How probable is it that Sirius Black will break out of prison
and I'll have to track him down and defeat him in some sort of
spectacular duel, or better yet put a large bounty on his head and
hide out in Australia while I wait for the results?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. "Not likely. No one has
ever escaped from Azkaban, and I doubt that <i>he</i> will be the
first."</p>
<p>Harry was a bit sceptical of that "<i>no one</i> has <i>ever</i>
escaped from Azkaban" line. Still, maybe with magic you could
actually get close to a 100% perfect prison, especially if you had
a wand and they did not. The best way to get out would be to not go
there in the first place.</p>
<p>"All right then," Harry said. "Sounds like it's been nicely
wrapped up." He sighed, scrubbing his palm over his head. "Or maybe
the Dark Lord didn't <i>really</i> die that night. Not completely.
His spirit lingers, whispering to people in nightmares that bleed
over into the waking world, searching for a way back into the
living lands he swore to destroy, and now, in accordance with the
ancient prophecy, he and I are locked in a deadly duel where the
winner shall lose and the loser shall win -"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's head swivelled, and her eyes darted
around, as though to search the street for listeners.</p>
<p>"I'm <i>joking</i>, Professor," Harry said with some annoyance.
Sheesh, why did she always take everything so seriously -</p>
<p>A slow sinking sensation began to dawn in the pit of Harry's
stomach.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with a calm expression. A
very, <i>very</i> calm expression. Then a smile was put on. "Of
course you are, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p><i>Aw crap.</i></p>
<p>If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had
just flashed into his mind, it would have come out something like,
'If I estimate the probability of Professor McGonagall doing what I
just saw as the result of carefully controlling herself, versus the
probability distribution for all the things she would do
<i>naturally</i> if I made a bad joke, then this behavior is
significant evidence for her hiding something.'</p>
<p>But what Harry actually thought was, <i>Aw crap.</i></p>
<p>Harry turned his own head to scan the street. Nope, no one
nearby. "He's <i>not</i> dead, is he," Harry sighed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord is alive. Of <i>course</i> he's alive. It was an
<i>act</i> of utter <i>optimism</i> for me to have even
<i>dreamed</i> otherwise. I <i>must</i> have taken leave of my
<i>senses</i>, I can't <i>imagine</i> what I was <i>thinking.</i>
Just because <i>someone</i> said that his body was found burned to
a <i>crisp</i>, I can't imagine why I would have thought he was
<i>dead.</i> <i>Clearly</i> I have much left to learn about the art
of proper <i>pessimism.</i>"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"At least tell me there's not really a prophecy..." Professor
McGonagall was still giving him that bright, fixed smile. "Oh, you
have <i>got</i> to be kidding me."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, you shouldn't go inventing things to worry about
-"</p>
<p>"Are you <i>actually</i> going to tell me <i>that?</i> Imagine
my reaction later, when I find out that there was something to
worry about after all."</p>
<p>Her fixed smile faltered.</p>
<p>Harry's shoulders slumped. "I have a whole world of magic to
analyse. I do <i>not</i> have time for this."</p>
<p>Then both of them shut up, as a man in flowing orange robes
appeared on the street and slowly passed them by; Professor
McGonagall's eyes tracked him, unobtrusively. Harry's mouth was
moving as he chewed hard on his lip, and someone watching closely
would have noticed a tiny spot of blood appear.</p>
<p>When the orange-robed man had passed into the distance, Harry
spoke again, in a low murmur. "Are you going to tell me the truth
now, Professor McGonagall? And don't bother trying to wave it off,
I'm not stupid."</p>
<p>"You're <i>eleven years old</i>, Mr. Potter!" she said in a
harsh whisper.</p>
<p>"And therefore subhuman. Sorry... for a moment there, I
<i>forgot</i>."</p>
<p>"These are dreadful and important matters! They are
<i>secret,</i> Mr. Potter! It is a <i>catastrophe</i> that you,
still a child, know even this much! You must not tell
<i>anyone,</i> do you understand? Absolutely no one!"</p>
<p>As sometimes happened when Harry got <i>sufficiently</i> angry,
his blood went cold, instead of hot, and a terrible dark clarity
descended over his mind, mapping out possible tactics and assessing
their consequences with iron realism.</p>
<p><i>Point out that you have a right to know: Failure.
Eleven-year-old children do not have rights to know anything, in
McGonagall's eyes.</i></p>
<p><i>Say that you will not be friends any more: Failure. She does
not value your friendship sufficiently.</i></p>
<p><i>Point out that you will be in danger if you do not know:
Failure. Plans have already been made based on your ignorance.
The</i> certain <i>inconvenience of rethinking will seem far more
unpalatable than the mere</i> uncertain <i>prospect of your coming
to harm.</i></p>
<p><i>Justice and reason will both fail. You must either find
something you have that she wants, or find something you can do
which she fears...</i></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>"Well then, Professor," Harry said in a low, icy tone, "it
sounds like I have something you want. You can, if you like, tell
me the truth, the <i>whole</i> truth, and in return I will keep
your secrets. Or you can try to keep me ignorant so you can use me
as a pawn, in which case I will owe you nothing."</p>
<p>McGonagall stopped short in the street. Her eyes blazed and her
voice descended into an outright hiss. "How dare you!"</p>
<p>"<i>How dare you!</i>" he whispered back at her.</p>
<p>"You would <i>blackmail</i> me?"</p>
<p>Harry's lips twisted. "I am <i>offering</i> you a <i>favor.</i>
I am <i>giving</i> you a chance to protect <i>your</i> precious
secret. If you refuse I will have <i>every</i> natural motive to
make inquiries elsewhere, not to spite you, but because I <i>have
to know!</i> Get past your pointless anger at a <i>child</i> who
you think ought to obey you, and you'll realise that any sane adult
would do the same! <i>Look at it from my perspective! How would you
feel if it was YOU?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry watched McGonagall, observed her harsh breathing. It
occurred to him that it was time to ease off the pressure, let her
simmer for a while. "You don't have to decide right away," Harry
said in a more normal tone. "I'll understand if you want time to
think about my <i>offer</i>... but I'll warn you of one thing,"
Harry said, his voice going colder. "Don't try that Obliviation
spell on me. Some time ago I worked out a signal, and I have
already sent that signal to myself. If I find that signal and I
don't <i>remember</i> sending it..." Harry let his voice trail off
significantly.</p>
<p>McGonagall's face was working as her expressions shifted. "I...
wasn't thinking of Obliviating you, Mr. Potter... but why would you
have <i>invented</i> such a signal if you didn't know about -"</p>
<p>"I thought of it while reading a Muggle science-fiction book,
and said to myself, <i>well, just in case...</i> And no, I won't
tell you the signal, I'm not dumb."</p>
<p>"I hadn't planned to ask," McGonagall said. She seemed to fold
in on herself, and suddenly looked very old, and very tired. "This
has been an exhausting day, Mr. Potter. Can we get your trunk, and
send you home? I will trust you not to speak upon this matter until
I have had time to think. Keep in mind that there are only two
other people in the whole world who know about this matter, and
they are Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and Professor Severus
Snape."</p>
<p>So. New information; that was a peace offering. Harry nodded in
acceptance, and turned his head to look forward, and started
walking again, as his blood slowly began to warm over once
more.</p>
<p>"So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark
Wizard," Harry said, and sighed in frustration. "I really wish you
had told me that <i>before</i> I started shopping."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop
Harry had visited; the curtains were lush and delicately patterned,
the floor and walls of stained and polished wood, and the trunks
occupied places of honor on polished ivory platforms. The salesman
was dressed in robes of finery only a cut below those of Lucius
Malfoy, and spoke with exquisite, oily politeness to both Harry and
Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of
heavy-looking wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with
the pattern of a guardian dragon whose eyes shifted to look at
anyone nearing it. A trunk charmed to be light, to shrink on
command, to sprout small clawed tentacles from its bottom and
squirm after its owner. A trunk with two drawers on each of four
sides that each slid out to reveal compartments as deep as the
whole trunk. A lid with four locks each of which would reveal a
different space inside. And - this was the important part - a
handle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a staircase
leading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry
estimated, around twelve bookcases.</p>
<p>If they made luggages like this, Harry didn't know why anyone
bothered owning a house.</p>
<p>One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a
good trunk, lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the
Galleon, that was enough to buy a second-hand car. It would be more
expensive than everything else Harry had ever bought in his whole
life all put together.</p>
<p>Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of
gold Harry had been allowed to take out of Gringotts.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After
a long day's shopping she hadn't needed to ask Harry how much gold
was left in the bag, after the salesman quoted his price, which
meant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and
paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that <i>scientifically
illiterate</i> was not at all the same thing as <i>stupid.</i></p>
<p>"I'm sorry, young man," said Professor McGonagall. "This is
entirely my fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but
the bank will be closed for all but emergency services now."</p>
<p>Harry looked at her, wondering...</p>
<p>"Well," sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel,
"we may as well go, I suppose."</p>
<p>...she <i>hadn't</i> lost it completely when a child had dared
defy her. She hadn't been happy, but she had <i>thought</i> instead
of exploding in fury. It might have just been that there was an
immortal Dark Lord to fight - that she had needed Harry's goodwill.
But most adults wouldn't have been capable of thinking even that
much; wouldn't consider <i>future consequences</i> at all, if
someone lower in status had refused to obey
them...<i><br /></i></p>
<p>"Professor?" Harry said.</p>
<p>The witch turned back and looked at him.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for
what he wanted to try now, there was no way he'd have the courage
to do it otherwise. <i>She didn't listen to me,</i> he thought to
himself, <i>I would have taken more gold but she didn't want to
listen...</i> Focusing his entire world on McGonagall and the need
to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.</p>
<p>"Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than
enough for a trunk. That's why you didn't bother warning me before
it went down to ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the
research studies show - that's what happens when people think
they're leaving themselves a <i>little</i> error margin. They're
not pessimistic enough. If it'd been up to me, I'd have taken
<i>two hundred</i> Galleons just to be sure. There was plenty of
money in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But
I thought you wouldn't let me do it. I thought you'd be angry at me
just for asking. Was I wrong?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I must confess that you are right," said Professor
McGonagall. "But, young man -"</p>
<p>"That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting
adults." Somehow Harry kept his voice steady. "Because they get
angry if you even <i>try</i> to reason with them. To them it's
defiance and insolence and a challenge to their higher tribal
status. If you try to talk to them they get <i>angry.</i> So if I
had anything <i>really</i> <i>important</i> to do, I wouldn't be
able to trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to
whatever I said - because that's also part of the <i>role</i> of
someone playing a concerned adult - you'd never change your
actions, you wouldn't actually behave differently, because of
anything I said."</p>
<p>The salesman was watching them both with unabashed
fascination.</p>
<p>"I can understand your point of view," Professor McGonagall said
eventually. "If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I
have served as Head of Gryffindor House for what feels like several
thousand years."</p>
<p>Harry nodded and continued. "So - suppose I had a way to get
more Galleons from my vault <i>without</i> us going back to
Gringotts, but it involved me violating the role of an obedient
child. Would I be able to trust you with that, even though you'd
have to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take
advantage of it?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"To put it another way, if I could make today have happened
differently, so that we <i>didn't</i> take too little money with
us, would that be all right even though it would involve a child
being insolent to an adult in retrospect?"</p>
<p>"I... suppose..." the witch said, looking quite puzzled.</p>
<p>Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, "Eleven Galleons
originally from my family vault."</p>
<p>And there was gold in Harry's hand.</p>
<p>For a moment Professor McGonagall's mouth gaped wide, then her
jaw snapped shut and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out,
"<i>Where</i> did you get that -"</p>
<p>"From my family vault, like I said."</p>
<p>"<i>How?</i>"</p>
<p>"Magic."</p>
<p>"That's hardly an answer!" snapped Professor McGonagall, and
then stopped, blinking.</p>
<p>"No, it isn't, is it? I <i>ought</i> to claim that it's because
I experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the pouch works
and that it can actually retrieve objects from anywhere, not just
its own inside, if you phrase the request correctly. But actually
it's from when I fell into that pile of gold before and I shoved
some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who understands pessimism
knows that money is something you might need quickly and without
much warning. So now are you angry at me for defying your
authority? Or glad that we succeeded in our important mission?"</p>
<p>The salesman's eyes were wide like saucers.</p>
<p>And the tall witch stood there, silent.</p>
<p>"Discipline at Hogwarts <i>must</i> be enforced," she said after
almost a full minute. "For the sake of <i>all</i> the students. And
that <i>must</i> include courtesy and obedience from you to
<i>all</i> professors."</p>
<p>"I understand, Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home."</p>
<p>Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or
<i>something</i>. That was the first time his careful reasoning had
ever worked on <i>anyone</i>. Maybe because it was also the first
time he had something really serious that an adult needed from him,
but still -</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.</p>
<p>Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven
Galleons into McGonagall's hands. "Thank you very much, Professor.
Can you finish up the purchase for me? I've got to visit the
lavatory."</p>
<p>The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into
the wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away,
he heard the salesman ask in his oily voice, "May I inquire as to
who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin -
third-year, perhaps? - and from a prominent family, but I did not
recognise -"</p>
<p>The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry
had identified the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the
magical self-cleaning towel and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture
off his forehead. Harry's entire body was sheathed in sweat which
had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at least it
didn't show through the robes.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The sun was setting and it was very late indeed, by the time
they stood again in the courtyard of the Leaky Cauldron, the silent
leaf-dusted interface between magical Britain's Diagon Alley and
the entire Muggle world. (That was one <i>awfully</i> decoupled
economy...) Harry was to go to a phone box and call his father,
once he was on the other side. He didn't need to worry about his
luggage being stolen, apparently. His trunk had the status of a
major magical item, something that most Muggles wouldn't notice;
that was part of what you could get in the wizarding world, if you
were willing to pay the price of a secondhand car.</p>
<p>"So here we part ways, for a time," Professor McGonagall said.
She shook her head in wonderment. "This has been the strangest day
of my life for... many a year. Since the day I learned that a child
had defeated You-Know-Who. I wonder now, looking back, if that was
the last reasonable day of the world."</p>
<p>Oh, like <i>she</i> had anything to complain about. <i>You think
your day</i> <i>was surreal? Try mine.</i></p>
<p>"I was very impressed with you today," Harry said to her. "I
should have remembered to compliment you out loud, I was awarding
you points in my head and everything."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "If you had
already been sorted into a House I would have deducted so many
points that your grandchildren would still be losing the House
Cup."</p>
<p>"Thank <i>you</i>, Professor." It was probably too early to call
her Minnie.</p>
<p>This woman might well be the sanest adult Harry had ever met,
despite her lack of scientific background. Harry was even
considering offering her the number-two position in whatever group
he formed to fight the Dark Lord, though he wasn't silly enough to
say that out loud. <i>Now what would be a good name for that...?
The Death Eater Eaters?</i></p>
<p>"I'll see you again soon, when school starts," Professor
McGonagall said. "And, Mr. Potter, about your wand -"</p>
<p>"I know what you're going to ask," Harry said. He took out his
precious wand and, with a deep twinge of inner pain, flipped it
over in his hand, presenting her with the handle. "Take it. I
hadn't planned to do anything, not a single thing, but I don't want
you to have nightmares about me blowing up my house."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head rapidly. "Oh no, Mr. Potter!
That isn't done. I only meant to warn you not to <i>use</i> your
wand at home, since the Ministry can detect underage magic and it
is prohibited without supervision."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "That sounds like a very sensible rule. I'm
glad to see the wizarding world takes that sort of thing
seriously."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall peered hard at him. "You really mean
that."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "I get it. Magic is dangerous and the rules
are there for good reasons. Certain other matters are also
dangerous. I get that too. Remember that I am not stupid."</p>
<p>"I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does
make me feel better about entrusting you with certain things.
Goodbye for now."</p>
<p>Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the
Muggle world.</p>
<p>As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last
whisper from behind him.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.</p>
<p>"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train
to Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Who is she?"</p>
<p>There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor
McGonagall was gone.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His
twinkling eyes peered out at Minerva. "So, my dear, how did you
find Harry?"</p>
<p>Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then she
opened her mouth again. No words came out.</p>
<p>"I see," Albus said gravely. "Thank you for your report,
Minerva. You may go."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="7">Chapter 7</h2><h3>Reciprocation</h3>
<p>Whoa. A spokesman for Rowling's literary agent said that Rowling
is okay with the existence of fanfiction as long as no one charges
for it and everyone's clear that the original copyrights belong to
her? That's really cool of her. So thank you, JKR, and thine is the
kingdom!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>I feel the need to disclaim that certain parts of this chapter
are not meant as "bashing". It's not that I have a grudge, the
story just writes itself and once you start dropping anvils on a
character it's hard to stop.</p>
<p>A few reviewers have asked whether the science in this story is
real or made up. Yes, it is real, and if you look at my profile,
you'll see a link to a certain nonfiction site that will teach you
pretty much everything Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres knows <i>and
then some</i>.</p>
<p>Thank you very much to <i>all</i> my reviewers. (Especially
Darkandus on Viridian Dreams, for the surprisingly inspiring
comment "Lungs and tea are not meant to interact".</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad."</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Petunia Evans-Verres's lips were trembling and her eyes were
tearing up as Harry hugged her midsection on Platform Nine of the
King's Cross Station. "Are you sure you don't want me to come with
you, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry glanced over to his father Michael Verres-Evans, who was
looking stereotypically stern-but-proud, and then back to his
mother, who really did look rather... uncomposed. "Mum, I know you
don't like the wizarding world very much. You don't have to come
with. I mean it."</p>
<p>Petunia winced. "Harry, you shouldn't worry about me, I'm your
mother and if you need someone with you -"</p>
<p>"Mum, I'm going to be on my own at Hogwarts for <i>months</i>
and <i>months.</i> If I can't manage a train platform alone, better
to find out sooner rather than later so we can abort." He lowered
his voice to a whisper. "Besides, Mum, they all love me over there.
If I have any problems, all I need to do is take off my sweatband,"
Harry tapped the exercise band covering his scar, "and I'll have
<i>way</i> more help than I can handle."</p>
<p>"Oh, Harry," Petunia whispered. She knelt down and hugged him
hard, face to face, their cheeks resting against each other. Harry
could feel her ragged breathing, and then he heard a muffled sob
escape. "Oh, Harry, I do love you, always remember that."</p>
<p><i>It's like she's afraid she'll never see me again,</i> the
thought popped into Harry's head. He knew the thought was true but
he didn't know why Mum was so afraid.</p>
<p>So he made a guess. "Mum, you know that I'm not going to turn
into your sister just because I'm learning magic, right? I'll do
any magic you ask for - if I can, I mean - or if you want me
<i>not</i> to use any magic around the house, I'll do that too, I
promise I'll never let magic come between us -"</p>
<p>A tight hug cut off his words. "You have a good heart," his
mother whispered into his ear. "A very good heart, my son."</p>
<p>Harry choked up himself a little, then.</p>
<p>His mother released him, and stood up. She took a handkerchief
out of her handbag, and with a trembling hand dabbed at the running
makeup around her eyes.</p>
<p>There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the
magical side of King's Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking
at Harry's trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael
Verres-Evans couldn't even walk.</p>
<p>So instead his father just cleared his throat. "Good luck at
school, Harry," he said. "Do you think I bought you enough
books?"</p>
<p>Harry had explained to his father about how he thought this
might be his big chance to do something really revolutionary and
important, and Professor Verres-Evans had nodded and dumped his
extremely busy schedule for two solid days in order to go on the
Greatest Secondhand Bookshop Raid Ever, which had covered four
cities and produced <i>thirty</i> boxes of science books now
sitting in the cavern level of Harry's trunk. Most of the books had
gone for a pound or two, but some of them definitely <i>hadn't,</i>
like the very latest <i>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</i> or
the complete 1972 set of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica.</i> His
father had tried to block Harry off from seeing the till displays
but Harry figured his father must have spent <i>at least</i> a
thousand pounds. Harry had said to his father that he would pay him
back as soon as he figured out how to convert wizarding gold into
Muggle money, and his father had told him to go jump in a lake.</p>
<p>And then his father had asked him: <i>Do you think I bought you
enough books?</i> It was quite clear what answer Dad wanted to
hear.</p>
<p>Harry's throat was hoarse, for some reason. "You can never have
enough books," he recited the Verres family motto, and his father
knelt down and gave him a quick, firm embrace. "But you
<i>certainly</i> tried," Harry said, and felt himself choking up
again. "It was a really, really, <i>really</i> good try."</p>
<p>His Dad straightened. "So..." he said. "Do <i>you</i> see a
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters?"</p>
<p>King's Cross Station was huge and busy, with walls and floors
paved with ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It was full of ordinary
people hurrying about their ordinary business, having ordinary
conversations which generated lots and lots of ordinary noise.
King's Cross Station had a Platform Nine (which they were standing
on) and a Platform Ten (right nearby) but there was nothing between
Platform Nine and Platform Ten except a thin, unpromising barrier
wall. A great skylight overhead let in plenty of light to
illuminate the total lack whatsoever of any Platform Nine and
Three-Quarters.</p>
<p>Harry stared around until his eyes watered, thinking, <i>come
on, mage-sight, come on, mage-sight</i>, but absolutely nothing
appeared to him. He thought about taking out his wand and waving
it, but Professor McGonagall had warned him against using his wand.
Plus if there was another shower of multicoloured sparks that might
lead to being arrested for setting off fireworks inside a train
station. And that was assuming his wand didn't decide to do
something else, like blowing up all of King's Cross. Harry had only
lightly skimmed his schoolbooks (though that skim was quite bizarre
enough) in a very quick effort to determine what sort of science
books to buy over the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>Well, he had - Harry glanced at his watch - one whole hour to
figure it out, since he was supposed to be on the train at eleven.
Maybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids
couldn't become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave
yourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the
second most important factor in scholarly success.)</p>
<p>"I'll figure it out," Harry said to his waiting parents. "It's
probably some sort of test thingy."</p>
<p>His father frowned. "Hm... maybe look for a trail of mixed
footprints on the ground, leading somewhere that doesn't seem to
make sense -"</p>
<p>"<i>Dad!</i>" Harry said. "Stop that! I haven't even
<i>tried</i> to figure it out on my own!" It was a very good
suggestion, too, which was worse.</p>
<p>"Sorry," his father apologised.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry's mother said. "I don't think they would do that
to a student, do you? Are you sure Professor McGonagall didn't tell
you anything?"</p>
<p>"Maybe she was distracted," Harry said without thinking.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" hissed his father and mother in unison.
"<i>What did you do?</i>"</p>
<p>"I, um -" Harry swallowed. "Look, we don't have time for this
now -"</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>"</p>
<p>"I mean it! We don't have time for this now! Because it's a
really long story and I've got to figure out how to get to
school!"</p>
<p>His mother had a hand over her face. "How bad was it?"</p>
<p>"I, ah," <i>I can't talk about that for reasons of National
Security,</i> "about half as bad as the Incident with the Science
Project?"</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>"</p>
<p>"I, er, oh look there are some people with an owl I'll go ask
them how to get in!" and Harry ran away from his parents towards
the family of fiery redheads, his trunk automatically slithering
behind him.</p>
<p>The plump woman looked to him as he arrived. "Hello, dear. First
time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too -" and then she peered closely at
him. "<i>Harry Potter?</i>"</p>
<p>Four boys and a red-headed girl and an owl all swung around and
then froze in place.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>come on!</i>" Harry protested. He'd been planning to go
as Harry Verres at least until he got to Hogwarts. "I bought a
sweatband and everything! How come you know who I am?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry's father said, coming up behind him with long easy
strides, "how <i>do</i> you know who he is?" His voice indicated a
certain dread.</p>
<p>"Your picture was in the newspapers," said one of two
identical-looking twins.</p>
<p>"<i>HARRY!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Dad!</i> It's not like that! It's 'cause I defeated the Dark
Lord You-Know-Who when I was one year old!"</p>
<p>"<i>WHAT?</i>"</p>
<p>"Mum can explain."</p>
<p>"<i>WHAT?</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah... Michael dear, there are certain things I thought it would
be best not to bother you with until now -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said to the redheaded family who were all
staring at him, "but it would be quite extremely helpful if you
could tell me how to get to Platform Nine and Three Quarters
<i>right now</i>."</p>
<p>"Ah..." said the woman. She raised a hand and pointed at the
wall between platforms. "Just walk straight at the barrier between
platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash
into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if
you're nervous."</p>
<p>"And whatever you do, don't think of an elephant."</p>
<p>"<i>George!</i> Ignore him, Harry dear, there's no reason not to
think of an elephant."</p>
<p>"I'm Fred, Mum, not George -"</p>
<p>"Thanks!" Harry said and took off at a run towards the barrier
-</p>
<p>Wait a minute, it wouldn't work <i>unless he believed in
it?</i></p>
<p>It was at times like this that Harry hated his mind for actually
working fast enough to realise that this was a case where "resonant
doubt" applied, that is, if he'd started out thinking that he would
go through the barrier he'd have been fine, only now he was worried
about whether he sufficiently <i>believed</i> he'd go through the
barrier, which meant that he actually <i>was</i> worried about
crashing into it -</p>
<p>"<i>Harry! Get back here, you have some explaining to do!</i>"
That was his Dad.</p>
<p>Harry shut his eyes and ignored everything he knew about
justified credibility and just tried to believe <i>really hard</i>
that he'd go through the barrier and -</p>
<p>- the sounds around him changed.</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and stumbled to a halt, feeling vaguely
dirtied by having made a deliberate effort to believe
something.</p>
<p>He was standing in a bright, open-air platform next to a single
huge train, fourteen long carriages headed up by a massive
scarlet-metal steam engine with a tall chimney that promised death
to air quality. The platform was already lightly crowded (even
though Harry was a full hour early); dozens of children and their
parents swarmed around benches, tables, and various hawkers and
stalls.</p>
<p>It went entirely without saying that there was no such place in
King's Cross Station and no room to hide it.</p>
<p><i>Okay, so either (a) I just teleported somewhere else entirely
(b) they can fold space like no one's business or (c) they are
simply ignoring all the rules.</i></p>
<p>There was a slithering sound behind him, and Harry turned around
to observe that his trunk had indeed followed him on its small
clawed tentacles. Apparently, for magical purposes, his luggage had
also managed to believe with sufficient strength to pass through
the barrier. That was actually a little disturbing when Harry
started thinking about it.</p>
<p>A moment later, the youngest-looking red-haired boy came through
the iron archway (iron archway?) at a run, pulling his trunk behind
him on a lead and nearly crashing into Harry. Harry, feeling stupid
for having stayed around, quickly began moving away from the
landing area, and the red-haired boy followed him, yanking hard on
his trunk's lead in order to keep up. A moment later, a white owl
fluttered through the archway and came to rest on the boy's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Cor," said the red-haired boy, "are you <i>really</i> Harry
Potter?"</p>
<p><i>Not this again.</i> "I have no logical way of knowing that
for certain. My parents raised me to <i>believe</i> that my name
was Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, and many people here have told
me that I <i>look</i> like my parents, I mean my other parents,
but," Harry frowned, realising, "for all <i>I</i> know, there could
easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specified appearance
-"</p>
<p>"Er, what, mate?"</p>
<p><i>Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it.</i> "Yes, I'm Harry
Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm Ron Weasley," said the tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid,
and stuck out a hand, which Harry politely shook as they walked.
The owl gave Harry an oddly measured and courteous hoot (actually
more of an eehhhhh sound, which surprised Harry).</p>
<p>At this point Harry realised the potential for imminent
catastrophe. "Just a second," he said to Ron, and opened one of the
drawers of his trunk, the one that if he recalled correctly was for
Winter Clothes - it was - and then he found the lightest scarf he
owned, underneath his winter coat. Harry took off his sweatband,
and just as quickly unfolded the scarf and tied it around his face.
It was a little hot, especially in the summer, but Harry could live
with that.</p>
<p>Then he shut that drawer and pulled out another drawer and drew
forth black wizarding robes, which he shrugged over his head, now
that he was out of Muggle territory.</p>
<p>"There," Harry said. The sound came out slightly muffled through
the scarf over his face. He turned to Ron. "How do I look? Stupid,
I know, but am I identifiable as Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>"Er," Ron said. He closed his mouth, which had been open. "Not
really, Harry."</p>
<p>"Very good," Harry said. "However, so as not to obviate the
point of the whole exercise, you will henceforth address me as,"
Verres might not work anymore, "Mr. Spoo."</p>
<p>"Okay, Harry," Ron said uncertainly.</p>
<p><i>The Force is not particularly strong in this one.</i>
"Call... me... Mister... Spoo."</p>
<p>"Okay, Mister Spoo -" Ron stopped. "I can't do that, it makes me
feel stupid."</p>
<p><i>That's not just a feeling.</i> "Okay. <i>You</i> pick a
name."</p>
<p>"Mr. Cannon," Ron said at once. "For the Chudley Cannons."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry knew he was going to terribly regret asking this.
"Who or what are the Chudley Cannons?"</p>
<p>"<i>Who're the Chudley Cannons?</i> Only the most brilliant team
in the whole history of Quidditch! Sure, they finished at the
bottom of the league last year, but -"</p>
<p>"What's Quidditch?"</p>
<p>Asking this was also a mistake.</p>
<p>"So let me get this straight," Harry said as it seemed that
Ron's explanation (with associated hand gestures) was winding down.
"Catching the Snitch is worth <i>one hundred and fifty
points?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yeah -"</p>
<p>"How many ten-point goals does one side usually score <i>not</i>
counting the Snitch?"</p>
<p>"Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games -"</p>
<p>"That's just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game
design. Look, the rest of this game sounds like it might make
sense, sort of, for a sport I mean, but you're basically saying
that catching the Snitch overwhelms almost any ordinary point
spread. The two Seekers are up there flying around looking for the
Snitch and usually not interacting with anyone else, spotting the
Snitch first is going to be mostly luck -"</p>
<p>"It's not luck!" protested Ron. "You've got to keep your eyes
moving in the right pattern -"</p>
<p>"That's not <i>interactive,</i> there's no back-and-forth with
the other player and how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly
good at moving their eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky
swoops in and grabs the Snitch and makes everyone else's work moot.
It's like someone took a real game and grafted on this pointless
extra position so that you could be the Most Important Player
without needing to really get involved or learn the rest of it. Who
was the first Seeker, the King's idiot son who wanted to play
Quidditch but couldn't understand the rules?" Actually, now that
Harry thought about it, that seemed like a surprisingly good
hypothesis. Put him on a broomstick and tell him to catch the shiny
thing...</p>
<p>Ron's face pulled into a scowl. "If you don't like Quidditch,
you don't have to make fun of it!"</p>
<p>"If you can't criticise, you can't optimise. I'm suggesting how
to <i>improve the game.</i> And it's very simple. Get rid of the
Snitch."</p>
<p>"They won't change the game just 'cause <i>you</i> say so!"</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen to
me. And maybe if I can persuade them to change the game at
Hogwarts, the innovation will spread."</p>
<p>A look of absolute horror was spreading over Ron's face. "But,
but if you get rid of the Snitch, how will anyone know when the
game ends?"</p>
<p>"<i>Buy... a... clock.</i> It would be a lot fairer than having
the game sometimes end after ten minutes and sometimes not end for
hours, and the schedule would be a lot more predictable for the
spectators, too." Harry sighed. "Oh, stop giving me that look of
absolute horror, I probably won't <i>actually</i> take the time to
destroy this pathetic excuse for a national sport and remake it
stronger and smarter in my own image. I've got way, way, <i>way</i>
more important stuff to worry about." Harry looked thoughtful.
"Then again, it wouldn't <i>take</i> much time to write up the
Ninety-Five Theses of the Snitchless Reformation and nail it to a
church door -"</p>
<p>"Potter," drawled a young boy's voice, "<i>what</i> is that on
your face and <i>what</i> is standing next to you?"</p>
<p>Ron's look of horror was replaced by utter hatred.
"<i>You!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry turned his head; and indeed it was Draco Malfoy, who might
have been forced to wear standard school robes, but was making up
for that with a trunk looking at least as magical and far more
elegant than Harry's own, decorated in silver and emeralds and
bearing what Harry guessed to be the Malfoy family crest, a
beautiful fanged serpent over crossed ivory wands.</p>
<p>"Draco!" Harry said. "Er, or Malfoy if you prefer, though that
kind of sounds like Lucius to me. I'm glad to see you're doing so
well after, um, our last meeting. This is Ron Weasley. And I'm
trying to go incognito, so call me, eh," Harry looked down at his
robes, "Mister Black."</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" hissed Ron. "You can't use <i>that</i>
name!"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Why not?" It <i>sounded</i> nicely dark, like an
international man of mystery -</p>
<p>"I'd say it's a <i>fine</i> name," said Draco, "but it belongs
to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. I'll call you Mr.
Silver."</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> get away from... from Mr. Gold," Ron said coldly,
and took a forward step. "He doesn't need to talk to the likes of
you!"</p>
<p>Harry raised a placating hand. "I'll go by Mr. Bronze, thanks
for the naming schema. And, Ron, um," Harry struggled to find a way
to say this, "I'm glad you're so... enthusiastic about protecting
me, but I don't particularly mind talking to Draco -"</p>
<p>This was apparently the last straw for Ron, who spun on Harry
with eyes now aflame with outrage. "<i>What?</i> Do you <i>know</i>
who this is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Ron," Harry said, "you may remember that I called him
Draco without him needing to introduce himself."</p>
<p>Draco sniggered. Then his eyes lit on the white owl on Ron's
shoulder. "Oh, what's <i>this?</i>" Draco said in a drawl rich
with malice. "Where's the famous Weasley family rat?"</p>
<p>"Buried in the backyard," Ron said coldly.</p>
<p>"Aw, how sad. Pot... ah, Mr. Bronze, I should mention that the
Weasley family is widely agreed to have <i>the best pet story
ever</i>. Want to tell it, Weasley?"</p>
<p>Ron's face contorted. "You wouldn't think it was funny if it
happened to <i>your</i> family!"</p>
<p>"Oh," Draco purred, "but it wouldn't ever <i>happen</i> to the
Malfoys."</p>
<p>Ron's hands clenched into fists -</p>
<p>"That's enough," Harry said, putting as much quiet authority
into the voice as he could manage. It was clear that whatever this
was about, it was a painful memory for the red-haired kid. "If Ron
doesn't want to talk about it, he doesn't have to talk about it,
and I'd ask that you not talk about it either."</p>
<p>Draco turned a surprised look on Harry, and Ron nodded. "That's
right, Harry! I mean Mr. Bronze! You see what kind of person he is?
Now tell him to go away!"</p>
<p>Harry counted to ten inside his head, which for him was a very
quick <i>12345678910</i> - an odd habit left over from the age of
five when his mother had first instructed him to do it, and Harry
had reasoned that his way was faster and ought to be just as
effective. "I'm not telling him to go away," Harry said calmly.
"He's welcome to talk to me if he wants."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't intend to hang around with anyone who hangs
around with Draco Malfoy," Ron announced coldly.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "That's up to you. <i>I</i> don't intend to let
anyone say who I can and can't hang around with." Silently
chanting, <i>please go away, please go away...</i></p>
<p>Ron's face went blank with surprise, like he'd actually expected
that line to work. Then Ron spun about, yanked his luggage's lead
and stormed off down the platform.</p>
<p>"If you didn't like him," Draco said curiously, "why didn't you
just walk away?"</p>
<p>"Um... his mother helped me figure out how to get to this
platform from the King's Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to
tell him to get lost. And it's not that I <i>hate</i> this Ron
guy," Harry said, "I just, just..." Harry searched for words.</p>
<p>"Don't see any reason for him to exist?" offered Draco.</p>
<p>"Pretty much."</p>
<p>"Anyway, Potter... if you really were raised by Muggles -" Draco
paused here, as if waiting for a denial, but Harry didn't say
anything "- then you mightn't know what it's like to be famous.
People want to take up <i>all</i> of our time. You <i>have</i> to
learn to say no."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, putting a thoughtful look on his face. "That
sounds like good advice."</p>
<p>"If you try to be nice, you just end up spending the most time
with the pushiest ones. Decide who you <i>want</i> to spend time
with and make everyone else leave. You're just getting here,
Potter, so everyone's going to judge you by who they see you with,
and you don't want to be seen with the likes of Ron Weasley."</p>
<p>Harry nodded again. "If you don't mind my asking, how did you
recognise me?"</p>
<p>"<i>Mister Bronze</i>," Draco drawled, "I <i>have</i> met you,
remember. I saw someone going around with a scarf wrapped around
his head, looking absolutely ridiculous. So I took a
<i>guess.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry bowed his head, accepting the compliment. "I'm
<i>terribly</i> sorry about that," Harry said. "Our first meeting,
I mean. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of Lucius."</p>
<p>Draco waved it off while giving Harry an odd look. "I just wish
Father could have come in while <i>you</i> were flattering
<i>me</i> -" Draco laughed. "But thank <i>you</i> for what you said
to Father. If not for that, I might've had a harder time
explaining."</p>
<p>Harry swept a deeper bow. "And thank <i>you</i> for
reciprocating with what you said to Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"You're welcome. Though one of the assistants must've sworn her
closest friend to absolute secrecy, because Father says there're
<i>weird rumors</i> going around, like you and I got in a fight or
something."</p>
<p>"Ouch," Harry said, wincing. "I'm <i>really</i> sorry -"</p>
<p>"No, we're used to it, Merlin knows there's lots of rumors about
the Malfoy family already."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "I'm glad to hear you're not in trouble."</p>
<p>Draco smirked. "Father has, um, a <i>refined</i> sense of humor,
but he <i>does</i> understand making friends. He understands it
<i>very</i> well. He made me repeat that before I went to bed every
night for the last month, 'I will make friends at Hogwarts.' When I
explained everything to him and he saw that's what I was doing, he
bought me an ice-cream."</p>
<p>Harry's jaw dropped. "<i>You managed to spin that into an
ice-cream?</i>"</p>
<p>Draco nodded, looking every bit as smug as the feat deserved.
"Well, father <i>knew</i> what I was doing, of course, but he's the
one who taught me <i>how</i> to do it, and if I grin the right way
<i>while</i> I'm doing it, that makes it a father-son thing and
then he <i>has</i> to buy me an ice-cream or I'll give him this
sort of sad look, like I think I must have disappointed him."</p>
<p>Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing the presence of another
master. "You've had <i>lessons</i> on how to manipulate
people?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Draco said proudly. "I'm a <i>Malfoy.</i> Father
bought me tutors."</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini's <i>Influence:
Science and Practice</i> probably didn't stack up very high
compared to that (though it was still one heck of a book). "Your
dad is almost as awesome as my dad."</p>
<p>Draco's eyebrows rose loftily. "Oh? And what does <i>your</i>
father do?"</p>
<p>"He buys me books."</p>
<p>Draco considered this. "That doesn't sound very impressive."</p>
<p>"You had to be there. Anyway, I'm glad to hear all that. The way
Lucius was looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify
you."</p>
<p>"My father really loves me," Draco said firmly. "He wouldn't
ever do that."</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. He remembered the black-robed, white-haired
figure of elegance that had stormed through Madam Malkin's,
wielding that beautiful, deadly silver-handled cane. It wasn't easy
to visualise him as a doting father. "Don't take this the wrong
way, but how do you <i>know</i> that?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" It was clear that this was a question Draco did not
commonly ask himself.</p>
<p>"I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you
believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you
think you know it? What makes you think Lucius wouldn't sacrifice
you the same way he'd sacrifice anything else for power?"</p>
<p>Draco shot Harry another odd look. "Just what do <i>you</i> know
about Father?"</p>
<p>"Um... seat on the Wizengamot, seat on Hogwarts' Board of
Governors, incredibly wealthy, has the ear of Minister Fudge, has
the confidence of Minister Fudge, probably has some highly
embarrassing photos of Minister Fudge, most prominent blood purist
now that the Dark Lord's gone, former Death Eater who was found to
have the Dark Mark but got off by claiming to be under the Imperius
Curse, which was ridiculously implausible and pretty much everyone
knew it... evil with a capital 'E' and a born killer... I think
that's it."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes had narrowed to slits. "McGonagall told you that,
did she."</p>
<p>"No, she wouldn't say <i>anything</i> to me about Lucius
afterwards, except to stay away from him. So during the Incident at
the Potions Shop, while Professor McGonagall was busy yelling at
the shopkeeper and trying to get everything under control, I
grabbed one of the customers and asked <i>them</i> about
Lucius."</p>
<p>Draco's eyes were wide again. "Did you <i>really?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry gave Draco a puzzled look. "If I lied the first time, I'm
not going to tell you the truth just because you ask twice."</p>
<p>There was a certain pause as Draco absorbed this.</p>
<p>"You're so completely going to be in Slytherin."</p>
<p>"I'm so completely going to be in Ravenclaw, thank you very
much. I only want power so I can get books."</p>
<p>Draco giggled. "Yeah, right. Anyway... to answer what you
asked..." Draco took a deep breath, and his face turned serious.
"Father once missed a Wizengamot vote for me. I was on a broom and
I fell off and broke a lot of ribs. It really hurt. I'd never hurt
that much before and I thought I was going to die. So Father missed
this really important vote, because he was there by my bed at St.
Mungo's, holding my hands and promising me that I was going to be
okay."</p>
<p>Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, with an effort, forced
himself to look back at Draco. "Why are you telling me <i>that?</i>
It seems sort of... private..."</p>
<p>Draco gave Harry a serious look. "One of my tutors once said
that people form close friendships by knowing private things about
each other, and the reason most people don't make close friends is
because they're too embarrassed to share anything really important
about themselves." Draco turned his palms out invitingly. "Your
turn?"</p>
<p>Knowing that Draco's hopeful face had probably been drilled into
him by months of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry
observed. Actually it <i>did</i> make it <i>less</i> effective, but
unfortunately not <i>ineffective.</i> The same could be said of
Draco's clever use of reciprocation pressure for an unsolicited
gift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social
psychology books (one experiment had shown that an unconditional
gift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in
getting people to fill out surveys). Draco had made an unsolicited
gift of a confidence, and now invited Harry to offer a confidence
in return... and the thing was, Harry <i>did</i> feel pressured.
Refusal, Harry was certain, would be met with a look of sad
disappointment, and maybe a small amount of contempt indicating
that Harry had lost points.</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, "just so you know, I recognise exactly what
you're doing right now. My own books called it <i>reciprocation</i>
and they talk about how giving someone a straight gift of two
Sickles was found to be twice as effective as offering them twenty
Sickles in getting them to do what you want..." Harry trailed
off.</p>
<p>Draco was looking sad and disappointed. "It's not meant as a
trick, Harry. It's a real way of becoming friends."</p>
<p>Harry held up a hand. "I didn't say I wasn't going to respond. I
just need time to pick something that's private but just as
non-damaging. Let's say... I wanted you to know that I can't be
rushed into things." A pause to reflect could go a long way in
defusing the power of a lot of compliance techniques, once you
learned to recognise them for what they were.</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. "I'll wait while you come up with
something. Oh, and please take off the scarf while you say it."</p>
<p><i>Simple but effective.</i></p>
<p>And Harry couldn't help but notice how clumsy, awkward,
graceless his attempt at resisting manipulation / saving face /
showing off had appeared compared to Draco. <i>I need those
tutors.</i></p>
<p>"All right," Harry said after a time. "Here's mine." He glanced
around and then rolled the scarf back up over his face, exposing
everything but the scar. "Um... it sounds like you can really rely
on your father. I mean... if you talk to him seriously, he'll
always listen to you and take you seriously."</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Harry said, and swallowed. This was surprisingly
hard, but then it was meant to be. "Sometimes I wish my own Dad was
like yours." Harry's eyes flinched away from Draco's face, more or
less automatically, and then Harry forced himself to look back at
Draco.</p>
<p>Then it hit Harry <i>what on Earth he'd just said</i>, and Harry
hastily added, "Not that I wish my Dad was a flawless instrument of
death like Lucius, I only mean taking me seriously -"</p>
<p>"I understand," Draco said with a smile. "There... now doesn't
it feel like we're a little closer to being friends?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Yeah. It does, actually. Um... no offence, but
I'm going to put on my disguise again, I <i>really</i> don't want
to deal with -"</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>Harry rolled the scarf back down over his face.</p>
<p>"My father takes all his friends seriously," Draco said. "That's
why he has lots of friends. You should meet him."</p>
<p>"I'll think about it," Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook
his head in wonder. "So you really are his one weak point.
Huh."</p>
<p>Now Draco was giving Harry a <i>really</i> odd look. "You want
to go get something to drink and find somewhere to sit down?"</p>
<p>Harry realised he had been standing in one place for too long,
and stretched himself, trying to crick his back. "Sure."</p>
<p>The platform was starting to fill up now, but there was still a
quieter area on the far side away from the red steam engine. Along
the way they passed a stall containing a bald, bearded man offering
newspapers and comic books and stacked neon-green cans.</p>
<p>The stallholder was, in fact, leaning back and drinking out of
one of the neon-green cans at the exact point when he spotted the
refined and elegant Draco Malfoy approaching along with a
mysterious boy looking incredibly stupid with a scarf tied over his
face, causing the stallholder to experience a sudden coughing fit
in mid-drink and dribble a large amount of neon-green liquid onto
his beard.</p>
<p>"'Scuse me," Harry said, "but what <i>is</i> that stuff,
exactly?"</p>
<p>"Comed-Tea," said the stallholder. "If you drink it, something
surprising is bound to happen which makes you spill it on yourself
or someone else. But it's charmed to vanish just a few seconds
later -" Indeed the stain on his beard was already
disappearing.</p>
<p>"How droll," said Draco. "How very, very droll. Come, Mr.
Bronze, let's go find another -"</p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said.</p>
<p>"<i>Oh come on!</i> That's just, just <i>juvenile!</i>"</p>
<p>"No, I'm sorry Draco, I <i>have</i> to investigate this. What
happens if I drink Comed-Tea while doing my best to keep the
conversation completely serious?"</p>
<p>The stallholder smiled mysteriously. "Who knows? A friend walks
by in a frog costume? Something unexpected is bound to happen
-"</p>
<p>"No. I'm sorry. I just don't believe it. That violates my
much-abused suspension of disbelief on so many levels I don't even
have the language to describe it. There is, there is just <i>no
way</i> a bloody <i>drink</i> can manipulate reality to produce
<i>comedy setups</i>, or I'm going to give up and retire to the
Bahamas -"</p>
<p>Draco groaned. "Are we <i>really</i> going to do this?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to drink it but I <i>have</i> to investigate.
<i>Have</i> to. How much?"</p>
<p>"Five Knuts the can," the stallholder said.</p>
<p>"<i>Five Knuts?</i> You can sell reality-manipulating fizzy
drinks for <i>five Knuts the can?"</i> Harry reached into his
pouch, said "four Sickles, four Knuts", and slapped them down on
the counter. "Two dozen cans please."</p>
<p>"I'll also take one," Draco sighed, and started to reach for his
pockets.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head rapidly. "No, I've got this, doesn't count
as a favor either, I want to see if it works for you too." He took
a can from the stack now placed on the counter and tossed it to
Draco, then started feeding his pouch. The pouch's Widening Lip ate
the cans accompanied by small burping noises, which wasn't exactly
helping to restore Harry's faith that he would someday discover a
reasonable explanation for all this.</p>
<p>Twenty-two burps later, Harry had the last purchased can in his
hand, Draco was looking at him expectantly, and the two of them
pulled the ring at the same time.</p>
<p>Harry rolled up his scarf to expose his mouth, and they tilted
their heads back and drank the Comed-Tea.</p>
<p>It somehow <i>tasted</i> bright green - extra-fizzy and limer
than lime.</p>
<p>Aside from that, nothing else happened.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the stallholder, who was watching them
benevolently.</p>
<p><i>All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural
accident to sell me twenty-four cans of nothing</i><i>, I'm going
to applaud his creative entrepreneurial spirit and then kill
him.</i></p>
<p>"It doesn't always happen immediately," the stallholder said.
"But it's guaranteed to happen once per can, or your money
back."</p>
<p>Harry took another long drink.</p>
<p>Once again, nothing happened.</p>
<p><i>Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as
possible... and hope my stomach doesn't explode from all the carbon
dioxide, or that I don't burp while drinking it...</i></p>
<p>No, he could afford to be a <i>little</i> patient. But honestly,
Harry didn't see how this was going to work. You couldn't go up to
someone and say "Now I'm going to surprise you" or "And now I'm
going to tell you the punchline of the joke, and it'll be really
funny." It ruined the shock value. In Harry's state of mental
preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could have walked past in a ballerina
outfit and it wouldn't have made him do a proper spit-take. Just
what sort of wacky shenanigan was the universe supposed to cough up
<i>now?</i></p>
<p>"Anyway, let's sit down," Harry said. He prepared to swig
another drink and started towards the distant seating area, which
put him at the right angle to glance back and see the portion of
the stall's newspaper stand that was devoted to a newspaper called
<i>The Quibbler</i>, which was showing the following headline:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS<br />
DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT</i></p>
<p>"<i>Gah!</i>" screamed Draco as bright green liquid sprayed all
over him from Harry's direction. Draco turned to Harry with fire in
his eyes and grabbed his own can. "You son of a mudblood! Let's see
how <i>you</i> like being spat upon!" Draco took a deliberate swig
from the can just as his own eyes caught sight of the headline.</p>
<p>In sheer reflex action, Harry tried to block his face as the
spray of liquid flew in his direction. Unfortunately he blocked
using the hand containing the Comed-Tea, sending the rest of the
green liquid to splash out over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the can in his hand even as he went on choking
and spluttering and the green colour started to vanish from Draco's
robes.</p>
<p>Then he looked up and stared at the newspaper headline.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS<br />
DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT</i></p>
<p>Harry's lips opened and said, "buh-bluh-buh-buh..."</p>
<p>Too many competing objections, that was the problem. Every time
Harry tried to say "But we're only eleven!" the objection "But men
can't get pregnant!" demanded first priority and was then run over
by "But there's nothing between us, really!"</p>
<p>Then Harry looked down at the can in his hand again.</p>
<p>He was feeling a deep-seated desire to run away screaming at the
top of his lungs until he dropped from lack of oxygen, and the only
thing stopping him was that he had once read that outright panic
was the sign of a <i>truly</i> important scientific problem.</p>
<p>Harry snarled, threw the can violently into a nearby rubbish
bin, and stalked back over to the stall. "One copy of <i>The
Quibbler,</i> please." Harry paid over four more Knuts, retrieved
another can of Comed-Tea from his pouch, and then stalked over to
the picnic area with the blond-haired boy, who was staring at his
own can with an expression of frank admiration.</p>
<p>"I take it back," Draco said, "that was pretty good."</p>
<p>"Hey, Draco, you know what I bet is even better for becoming
friends than exchanging secrets? Committing murder."</p>
<p>"I have a tutor who says that," Draco allowed. He reached inside
his robes and scratched himself with an easy, natural motion.
"Who've you got in mind?"</p>
<p>Harry slammed <i>The Quibbler</i> down hard on the picnic table.
"The guy who came up with this headline."</p>
<p>Draco groaned. "Not a guy. A girl. A <i>ten-year-old</i> girl,
can you believe it? She went nuts after her mother died and her
father, who owns this newspaper, is <i>convinced</i> that she's a
seer, so when he doesn't know he asks Luna Lovegood and believes
<i>anything</i> she says."</p>
<p>Not really thinking about it, Harry pulled the ring on his next
can of Comed-Tea and prepared to drink. "Are you kidding me? That's
even worse than Muggle journalism, which I would have thought was
physically impossible."</p>
<p>Draco snarled. "She has some sort of perverse obsession about
the Malfoys, too, and her father is politically opposed to us so he
prints every word. As soon as I'm old enough I'm going to rape
her."</p>
<p>Green liquid spurted out of Harry's nostrils, soaking into the
scarf still covering that area. Comed-Tea and lungs did not mix,
and Harry spent the next few seconds frantically coughing.</p>
<p>Draco looked at him sharply. "Something wrong?"</p>
<p>It was at this point that Harry came to the sudden realisation
that (a) the sounds coming from the rest of the train platform had
turned into more of a blurred white noise at around the same time
Draco had reached inside his robes, and (b) when he had discussed
committing murder as a bonding method, there had been exactly one
person in the conversation who'd thought they were joking.</p>
<p><i>Right. Because he</i> seemed <i>like such a normal kid. And
he</i> is <i>a normal kid, he is just what you'd</i> expect <i>a
baseline male child to be like if Darth Vader were his doting
father.</i></p>
<p>"Yes, well," Harry coughed, oh god how was he going to get out
of this conversational wedge, "I was just surprised at how you were
willing to discuss it so openly, you didn't seem worried about
getting caught or anything."</p>
<p>Draco snorted. "Are you joking? <i>Luna Lovegood's</i> word
against mine?"</p>
<p>Holy crap on a holy stick. "There's no such thing as magical
truth detection, I take it?" <i>Or DNA testing... yet.</i></p>
<p>Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. "That's right, you don't
know anything. Look, I'll explain things to you, I mean the way it
really works, just like you were already in Slytherin and asked me
the same question. But you've got to swear not to say anything
about it."</p>
<p>"I swear," Harry said.</p>
<p>"The courts use Veritaserum, but it's a joke really, you just
get yourself Obliviated before you testify and then claim the other
person was Memory-Charmed with a fake memory. Of course if you're
just some normal person, the courts presume in favor of
Obliviation, not False Memory Charms. But the court has discretion,
and if <i>I'm</i> involved then it impinges on the honor of a Noble
House, so it goes to the Wizengamot, where Father has the votes.
After I'm found not guilty the Lovegood family has to pay
reparations for tarnishing my honor. And they know from the start
that's how it'll go, so they'll just keep their mouths shut."</p>
<p>A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with
instructions to keep his voice and face normal. <i>Note to self:
Overthrow government of magical Britain at earliest
convenience.</i></p>
<p>Harry coughed again to clear his throat. "Draco, please please
<i>please</i> don't take this the wrong way, my word is my bond,
but like you said I could be in Slytherin and I really want to ask
for informational purposes, so what would happen <i>theoretically
speaking</i> if I <i>did</i> testify that I'd heard you plan
it?"</p>
<p>"Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I'd be in trouble,"
Draco answered smugly. "Since I <i>am</i> a Malfoy... Father has
the votes. And afterwards he'd crush you... well, I guess not
easily, since you <i>are</i> the Boy-Who-Lived, but Father is
pretty good at that sort of thing." Draco frowned. "'Sides,
<i>you</i> talked about murdering her, why weren't you worried
about <i>me</i> testifying after she turns up dead?"</p>
<p><i>How, oh how did my day go this wrong?</i> Harry's mouth was
already moving faster than he could think. "That's when I thought
she was <i>older!</i> I don't know how it works <i>here</i>, but in
Muggle Britain the courts would get a lot more upset about someone
killing a child -"</p>
<p>"That makes sense," Draco said, still looking a bit suspicious.
"But anyway, it's always smarter if it doesn't go to the Aurors at
all. If we're careful only to do things that Healing Charms can
fix, we can just Obliviate her afterwards and then do it all again
next week." Then the blonde-haired boy giggled, a youthful
high-pitched sound. "Though just imagine her saying she'd been done
by Draco Malfoy <i>and</i> the Boy-Who-Lived, not even
<i>Dumbledore</i> would believe her."</p>
<p><i>I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant
of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms.
"</i>Actually, can we hold off on that? After I found out that
headline came from a girl a year younger than me, I had a different
thought for my revenge."</p>
<p>"Huh? Do tell," Draco said, and started to take another swig of
his Comed-Tea.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know if the enchantment worked more than once per
can, but he <i>did</i> know he could avoid the blame, so he was
careful to time it exactly right:</p>
<p>"I was thinking <i>someday I'm going to marry that
woman.</i>"</p>
<p>Draco made a horrid ker-splutching sound and leaked green fluid
out the corners of his mouth like a broken car radiator. "<i>Are
you nuts?</i>"</p>
<p>"Quite the opposite, I'm so sane it burns like ice."</p>
<p>"You've got weirder taste than a Lestrange," Draco said,
sounding half-admiring about it. "And I suppose you want her all to
yourself, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yep. I can owe you a favor for it -"</p>
<p>Draco waved it off. "Nah, this one's free."</p>
<p>Harry stared down at the can in his hand, the coldness settling
into his blood. Charming, happy, generous with his favors to his
friends, Draco wasn't a psychopath. That was the sad and awful
part, knowing human psychology well enough to <i>know</i> that
Draco <i>wasn't</i> a monster. There had been ten thousand
societies over the history of the world where this conversation
could have happened. No, the world would have been a very different
place indeed, if it took an <i>evil</i> <i>mutant</i> to say what
Draco had said. It was very simple, very human, it was the default
if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren't
people.</p>
<p>And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as
in the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of
a sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he
was above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl.
There were places in Muggle-land where it was still the same way,
countries where that sort of nobility still existed and still
thought like that, or even grimmer lands where it wasn't just the
nobility. It was like that in every place and time that didn't
descend directly from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, it
seemed, which didn't quite include magical Britain, for all that
there had been cross-cultural contamination of things like
ring-pull drinks cans.</p>
<p><i>And if Draco doesn't change his mind about wanting revenge,
and I don't throw away my own chance at happiness in life to marry
some poor crazy girl, then all I've just bought is time, and not
too much of it...</i></p>
<p>For one girl. Not for others.</p>
<p><i>I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all
the top blood purists and kill them.</i></p>
<p>They'd tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or
less - make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove
everything above the neck - and it hadn't worked out well from what
Harry recalled. Maybe he needed to dust off some of those history
books his father had bought him, and see if what had gone wrong
with the French Revolution was something easy to fix.</p>
<p>Harry gazed up at the sky, and at the pale shape of the Moon,
visible this morning through the cloudless air.</p>
<p><i>So the world is broken and flawed and insane, and cruel and
bloody and dark. This is news? You always knew that,
anyway...</i></p>
<p>"You're looking all serious," Draco said. "Let me guess, your
Muggle parents told you that this sort of thing was bad."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, not quite trusting his voice.</p>
<p>"Well, like Father says, there may be four houses, but in the
end everyone belongs to either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. And
frankly, you're not on the Hufflepuff end. If you decide to side
with the Malfoys under the table... our power and your
reputation... you could get away with things even <i>I</i> can't
do. Want to <i>try</i> it for a while? See what it's like?"</p>
<p><i>Aren't we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and
already coaxing your prey from hiding...</i></p>
<p>Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon. "Draco, you want to
explain the whole blood purity thing to me? I'm sort of new."</p>
<p>A wide smile crossed Draco's face. "You really should meet
Father and ask <i>him</i>, you know, he's our leader."</p>
<p>"Give me the thirty-second version."</p>
<p>"Okay," Draco said. He drew in a deep breath, and his voice grew
slightly lower, and took on a cadence. "Our powers have grown
weaker, generation by generation, as the mudblood taint increases.
Where Salazar and Godric and Rowena and Helga once raised Hogwarts
by their power, creating the Locket and the Sword and the Diadem
and the Cup, no wizard of these faded days has risen to rival them.
We are fading, all fading into Muggles as we interbreed with their
spawn and allow our Squibs to live. If the taint is not checked,
soon our wands will break and all our arts cease, the line of
Merlin will end and the blood of Atlantis fail. Our children will
be left scratching at the dirt to survive like the mere Muggles,
and darkness will cover all the world for ever." Draco took another
swig from his drinks can, looking satisfied; that seemed to be the
whole argument as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>"Persuasive," Harry said, meaning it descriptively rather than
normatively. It was a standard pattern: The Fall from Grace, the
need to guard what purity remained against contamination, the past
sloping upwards and the future sloping only down. And that pattern
also had its <i>counter</i>... "I have to correct you on one point
of fact, though. Your information about the Muggles is a bit out of
date. We aren't exactly scratching at the dirt anymore."</p>
<p>Draco's head snapped around. "<i>What?</i> What do you mean,
<i>we?</i>"</p>
<p>"We. The scientists. The line of Francis Bacon and the blood of
the Enlightenment. Muggles didn't just sit around crying about not
having wands, we have our <i>own</i> powers now, with or without
magic. If all your powers fail then we will all have lost something
very precious, because your magic is the only hint we have as to
how the universe must <i>really</i> work - but you won't be left
scratching at the ground. Your houses will still be cool in summer
and warm in winter, there will still be doctors and medicine.
Science can keep you alive if magic fails. It'd be a tragedy, but
not literally the end of all the light in the world. Just
saying."</p>
<p>Draco had backed up several feet and his face was full of mixed
fear and disbelief. "<i>What in the name of Merlin are you talking
about, Potter?</i>"</p>
<p>"Hey, I listened to <i>your</i> story, won't you listen to
mine?" <i>Clumsy,</i> Harry chided himself, but Draco actually did
stop backing off and seem to listen.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said, "I'm saying that you don't seem to have
been paying much attention to what goes on in the Muggle world."
Probably because the whole wizarding world seemed to regard the
rest of Earth as a slum, deserving around as much news coverage as
the <i>Financial Times</i> awarded to the routine agonies of
Burundi. "All right. Quick check. Have wizards ever been to the
Moon? You know, that thing?" Harry pointed up to that huge and
distant globe.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" Draco said. It was pretty clear the thought had
never occured to the boy. "<i>Go</i> to the - it's just a -" His
finger pointed at the little pale thingy in the sky. "You can't
Apparate to somewhere you've never <i>been</i> and how would anyone
get to the Moon in the <i>first</i> place?"</p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said to Draco, "I'd like to show you a book I
brought with me, I think I remember what box it's in." And Harry
stood up and kneeled down and yanked out the stairs to the cavern
level of his trunk, then tore down the stairs and heaved a box off
another box, coming perilously close to treating his books with
disrespect, and snatched off the box cover and quickly but
carefully pried out a stack of books -</p>
<p>(Harry had inherited the nigh-magical Verres ability to remember
where all his books were, even after seeing them just once, which
was rather mysterious considering the lack of any genetic
connection.)</p>
<p>And Harry raced back up the stairs and shoved the staircase back
into the trunk with his heel, and, panting, turned the pages of the
book until he found the picture he wanted to show to Draco.</p>
<p>The one with the white, dry, cratered land, and the suited
people, and the blue-white globe hanging over it all.</p>
<p>That picture.</p>
<p><i>The</i> picture, if only one picture in all the world were to
survive.</p>
<p>"<i>That</i>," Harry said, his voice trembling because he
couldn't quite keep the pride out, "is what the Earth looks like
from the Moon."</p>
<p>Draco slowly leaned over. There was a strange expression on his
young face. "If that's a <i>real</i> picture, why isn't it
moving?"</p>
<p><i>Moving?</i> Oh. "Muggles can do moving pictures but they need
a bigger box to show it, they can't fit them onto single book pages
yet."</p>
<p>Draco's finger moved to one of the suits. "What are those?" His
voice starting to waver.</p>
<p>"Those are human beings. They are wearing suits that cover their
whole bodies to give them air, because there is no air on the
Moon."</p>
<p>"That's impossible," Draco whispered. There was terror in his
eyes, and utter confusion. "No Muggle could ever do that.
<i>How...</i>"</p>
<p>Harry took back the book, flipped the pages until he found what
he saw. "This is a rocket going up. The fire pushes it higher and
higher, until it gets to the Moon." Flipped pages again. "This is a
rocket on the ground. That tiny speck next to it is a person."
Draco gasped. "Going to the Moon cost the equivalent of... probably
around a thousand million Galleons." Draco choked. "And it took the
efforts of... probably more people than live in all of magical
Britain." <i>And when they arrived, they left a plaque that said,
'We came in peace, for all mankind.' Though you're not yet ready to
hear those words, Draco Malfoy...</i></p>
<p>"You're telling the truth," Draco said slowly. "You wouldn't
fake a whole book just for this - and I can hear it in your voice.
But... but..."</p>
<p>"How, without wands or magic? It's a long story, Draco. Science
doesn't work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by
knowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know
exactly what to do in order to make the universe do what you want.
If magic is like casting <i>Imperio</i> on someone to make them do
what you want, then science is like knowing them so well that you
can convince them it was their own idea all along. It's a lot more
difficult than waving a wand, but it works when wands fail, just
like if the <i>Imperius</i> failed you could still try persuading a
person. And Science builds from generation to generation. You have
to really <i>know</i> what you're doing to do science - and when
you really understand something, you can explain it to someone
else. The greatest scientists of one century ago, the brightest
names that are still spoken with reverence, their powers are as
<i>nothing</i> to the greatest scientists of today. There is no
equivalent in science of your lost arts that raised Hogwarts. In
science our powers wax by the year. And we are beginning to
understand and unravel the secrets of life and inheritance. We'll
be able to look at the very blood of which you spoke, and see what
makes you a wizard, and in one or two more generations, we'll be
able to persuade that blood to make all your children powerful
wizards too. So you see, your problem isn't nearly as bad as it
looks, because in a few more decades, science will be able to solve
it for you."</p>
<p>"But..." Draco said. His voice was trembling. "If <i>Muggles</i>
have that kind of power... then... what are <i>we?</i>"</p>
<p>"No, Draco, that's not it, don't you see? Science taps the power
of human understanding to look at the world and figure out how it
works. It can't fail without humanity itself failing. Your magic
could turn off, and you would hate that, but you would still be
<i>you</i>. You would still be alive to regret it. But because
science rests upon my human intelligence, it is the power that
cannot be removed from me without removing <i>me.</i> Even if the
laws of the universe change on me, so that all my knowledge is
void, I'll just figure out the new laws, as has been done before.
It's not a <i>Muggle</i> thing, it's a <i>human</i> thing, it just
refines and trains the power you use every time you look at
something you don't understand and ask 'Why?' You're of Slytherin,
Draco, don't you see the implication?"</p>
<p>Draco looked up from the book to Harry. His face showed dawning
understanding. "Wizards can learn to use this power."</p>
<p>Very carefully, now... the bait is set, now the hook... "If you
can learn to think of yourself as a <i>human</i> instead of a
<i>wizard</i> then you can train and refine your powers as a
human."</p>
<p>And if <i>that</i> instruction wasn't in <i>every</i> science
curriculum, Draco didn't need to know it, did he?</p>
<p>Draco's eyes were now thoughtful. "You've... already done
this?"</p>
<p>"To some extent," Harry allowed. "My training isn't complete.
Not at eleven. But - my father <i>also</i> bought me tutors, you
see." Sure, they'd been starving grad students, and it had only
been because Harry slept on a 26-hour cycle, but leave all that
aside for now...</p>
<p>Slowly, Draco nodded. "You think you can master <i>both</i>
arts, add the powers together, and..." Draco stared at Harry. "Make
yourself Lord of the two worlds?"</p>
<p>Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at
that point. "You have to realise, Draco, that the whole world you
know, all of magical Britain, is just one square on a much larger
gameboard. The gameboard that includes places like the Moon, and
the stars in the night sky, which are lights just like the Sun only
unimaginably far away, and things like galaxies that are vastly
huger than the Earth and Sun, things so large that only scientists
can see them and you don't even know they exist. But I really
<i>am</i> Ravenclaw, you know, not Slytherin. I don't want to rule
the universe. I just think it could be more sensibly
organised."</p>
<p>There was awe on Draco's face. "Why are you telling <i>me</i>
this?"</p>
<p>"Oh... there aren't many people who know how to do <i>true</i>
science - understanding something for the very first time, even if
it confuses the hell out of you. Help would be helpful."</p>
<p>Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open.</p>
<p>"But make no mistake, Draco, true science really <i>isn't</i>
like magic, you can't just do it and walk away unchanged like
learning how to say the words of a new spell. The power comes with
a cost, a cost so high that most people refuse to pay it."</p>
<p>Draco nodded at this as though, finally, he'd heard something he
could understand. "And that cost?"</p>
<p>"Learning to admit you're wrong."</p>
<p>"Um," Draco said after the dramatic pause had stretched on for a
while. "You going to explain that?"</p>
<p>"Trying to figure out how something works on that deep level,
the first ninety-nine explanations you come up with are wrong. The
hundredth is right. So you have to learn how to admit you're wrong,
over and over and over again. It doesn't sound like much, but it's
so hard that most people can't do science. Always questioning
yourself, always taking another look at things you've always taken
for granted," like having a Snitch in Quidditch, "and every time
you change your mind, you change yourself. But I'm getting way
ahead of myself here. Way ahead of myself. I just want you to
know... I'm offering to share some of my knowledge. If you want.
There's just one condition."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Draco said. "You know, Father says that when someone
says that to you, it is never a good sign, ever."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Now, don't mistake me and think that I'm trying
to drive a wedge between you and your father. It's not about that.
It's just about me wanting to deal with someone my own age, rather
than having this be between me and Lucius. I think your father
would be okay with that too, he knows you have to grow up sometime.
But your moves in our game have to be your own. That's my condition
- that I'm dealing with you, Draco, not your father."</p>
<p>"I've got to go," Draco said. He stood up. "I've got to go off
and think about this."</p>
<p>"Take your time," Harry said.</p>
<p>The sounds of the train platform changed from blurs into murmurs
as Draco wandered off.</p>
<p>Harry slowly exhaled the air he'd been holding in without quite
realising it, and then looked at the watch on his wrist, a simple
mechanical model that his father had bought him in hope it would
work in magic's presence. The second-hand was still ticking, and if
the minute hand was right, then it wasn't quite eleven just yet. He
probably ought to get on the train soon and start looking for
whatsherface, but it seemed worth taking a few minutes first to do
some breathing exercises and see if his blood warmed up again.</p>
<p>But when Harry looked up from his watch, he saw two figures
approaching, looking utterly ridiculous with their faces cloaked by
winter scarves.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Bronze," said one of the masked figures. "Can we
interest you in joining the Order of Chaos?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>Not too long after that, when all that day's fuss had finally
subsided, Draco was bent over a desk with quill in hand. He had a
private room in the Slytherin dungeons, with its own desk and its
own fire - sadly not even <i>he</i> rated a connection to the Floo
system, but at least Slytherin didn't buy into that utter nonsense
about making <i>everyone</i> sleep in dorms. There weren't many
private rooms, you had to be the <i>very</i> best within the House
of the better sort, but that could be taken for granted with the
House of Malfoy.</p>
<p><i>Dear Father,</i> Draco wrote.</p>
<p>And then he stopped.</p>
<p>Ink slowly dripped from his quill, staining the parchment near
the words.</p>
<p>Draco wasn't stupid. He was young, but his tutors had trained
him well. Draco knew that Potter probably felt a lot more sympathy
towards Dumbledore's faction than Potter was letting on... though
Draco did think Potter could be tempted. But it was crystal clear
that Potter was trying to tempt Draco just as Draco was trying to
tempt him.</p>
<p>And it was also clear that Potter was brilliant, and a whole lot
more than just slightly mad, and playing a vast game that Potter
himself mostly didn't understand, improvised at top speed with the
subtlety of a rampaging nundu. But Potter had managed to choose a
tactic that Draco couldn't just walk away from. He had offered
Draco a part of his own power, gambling that Draco couldn't use it
without becoming more like him. His father had called this an
advanced technique, and had warned Draco that it often didn't
work.</p>
<p>Draco knew he hadn't understood everything that had happened...
but Potter had offered <i>him</i> the chance to play and right now
it was <i>his.</i> And if he blurted the whole thing out, it would
become Father's.</p>
<p>In the end it was as simple as that. The lesser techniques
require the unawareness of the target, or at least their
uncertainty. Flattery has to be plausibly disguised as admiration.
("You should have been in Slytherin" is an old classic, highly
effective on a certain type of person who isn't expecting it, and
if it works you can repeat it.) But when you find someone's
ultimate lever it doesn't matter if they know you know. Potter, in
his mad rush, had guessed a key to Draco's soul. And if Draco knew
that Potter knew it - even if it had been an obvious sort of guess
- that didn't change anything.</p>
<p>So now, for the first time in his life, he had real secrets to
keep. He was playing his own game. There was an obscure pain to it,
but he knew that Father would be proud, and that made it all
right.</p>
<p>Leaving the ink drippings in place - there was a message there,
and one that his father would understand, for they had played the
game of subtleties more than once - Draco wrote out the one
question that really had gnawed at him about the whole affair, the
part that it seemed he <i>ought</i> to understand, but he didn't,
not at all.</p>
<p><i>Dear Father:</i></p>
<p><i>Suppose I told you that I met a student at Hogwarts, not
already part of our circle of acquaintances, who called you a
'flawless instrument of death' and said that I was your 'one weak
point'. What would you say about him?</i></p>
<p>It didn't take long after that for the family owl to bring the
reply.</p>
<p><i>My beloved son:</i></p>
<p><i>I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet someone
who enjoys the intimate confidence of our friend and valuable ally,
Severus Snape.</i></p>
<p>Draco stared at the letter for a while, and finally threw it
into the fire.</p>

<p>One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means
this is going to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that
FFN does not allow me any larger font size in which to say
<b>NO</b>. It honestly hadn't occurred to me that Luna might be a
<i>real</i> seer - I'll have to decide whether to run with that or
not - but I think we can all safely assume that if Luna <i>is</i> a
seer, she said something about "light planting a seed in darkness",
and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted this in rather the wrong
way.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>No one had asked for help, that was the problem. They'd just
gone around talking, eating, or staring into the air while their
parents exchanged gossip. For whatever odd reason, no one had been
sitting down reading a book, which meant she couldn't just sit down
next to them and take out her own book. And even when she'd boldly
taken the initiative by sitting down and continuing her third
read-through of <i>Hogwarts: A History,</i> no one had seemed
inclined to sit down next to her.</p>
<p>Aside from helping people with their homework, or anything else
they needed, she really didn't know how to meet people. She didn't
<i>feel</i> like she was a shy person. She thought of herself as a
take-charge sort of girl. And yet, somehow, if there wasn't some
request along the lines of "I can't remember how to do long
division" then it was just too <i>awkward</i> to go up to someone
and say... what? She'd never been able to figure out what. And
there didn't seem to be a standard information sheet, which was
ridiculous. The whole business of meeting people had never seemed
sensible to her. Why did <i>she</i> have to take all the
responsibility herself when there were two people involved? Why
didn't adults ever help? She wished some other girl would just walk
up to <i>her</i> and say, "Hermione, the teacher told me to be
friends with you."</p>
<p>But let it be quite clear that Hermione Granger, sitting alone
on the first day of school in one of the few compartments that had
been empty, in the last carriage of the train, with the compartment
door left open just in case anyone for any reason wanted to talk to
her, was <i>not</i> sad, lonely, gloomy, depressed, despairing, or
obsessing about her problems. She was, rather, rereading
<i>Hogwarts: A History</i> for the third time and quite enjoying
it, with only a faint tinge of annoyance in the back of her mind at
the general unreasonableness of the world.</p>
<p>There was the sound of an inter-train door opening, and then
footsteps and an odd slithering sound coming down the hallway of
the train. Hermione laid aside <i>Hogwarts: A History</i> and stood
up and stuck her head outside - just in case someone needed help -
and saw a young boy in a wizard's dress robes, probably first or
second year going by his height, and looking quite silly with a
scarf wrapped around his head. A small trunk stood on the floor
next to him. Even as she saw him, he knocked on the door of
another, closed compartment, and he said in a voice only slightly
muffled by the scarf, "Excuse me, can I ask a quick question?"</p>
<p>She didn't hear the answer from inside the compartment, but
after the boy opened the door, she did think she heard him say -
unless she'd somehow misheard - "Does anyone here know the six
quarks or where I can find a first-year girl named Hermione
Granger?"</p>
<p>After the boy had closed that compartment door, Hermione said,
"Can I help you with something?"</p>
<p>The scarfed face turned to look at her, and the voice said, "Not
unless you can name the six quarks or tell me where to find
Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>"Up, down, strange, charm, truth, beauty, and why are you
looking for her?"</p>
<p>It was hard to tell from this distance, but she thought she saw
the boy grin widely under his scarf. "Ah, so <i>you're</i> a
first-year girl named Hermione Granger," said that young, muffled
voice. "On the train to Hogwarts, no less." The boy started to walk
towards her and her compartment, and his trunk slithered along
after him. "Technically, all I needed to do was <i>look</i> for
you, but it seems likely that I'm meant to talk to you or invite
you to join my party or get a key magical item from you or find out
that Hogwarts was built over the ruins of an ancient temple or
something. PC or NPC, that is the question?"</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth to reply to this, but then she
couldn't think of any <i>possible</i> reply to... <i>whatever</i>
it was she'd just heard, even as the boy walked over to her, looked
inside the compartment, nodded with satisfaction, and sat down on
the bench across from her own. His trunk scurried in after him,
grew to three times its former diameter and snuggled up next to her
own in an oddly disturbing fashion.</p>
<p>"Please, have a seat," said the boy, "and do please close the
door behind you, if you would. Don't worry, I don't bite anyone who
doesn't bite me first." He was already unwinding the scarf from
around his head.</p>
<p>The imputation that this boy thought she was <i>scared</i> of
him made her hand send the door sliding shut, jamming it into the
wall with unnecessary force. She spun around and saw a young face
with bright, laughing green eyes, and an angry red-dark scar set
into his forehead that reminded her of something in the back of her
mind but right now she had more important things to think about. "I
didn't say I was Hermione Granger!"</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> didn't say you <i>said</i> you were Hermione Granger,
I just said you were Hermione Granger. If you're asking how I know,
it's because I know everything. Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres or Harry Potter for
short, I know that probably doesn't mean anything to <i>you</i> for
a change -"</p>
<p>Hermione's mind finally made the connection. The scar on his
forehead, the shape of a lightning bolt. "Harry Potter! You're in
<i>Modern Magical History</i> and <i>The Rise and Fall of the Dark
Arts</i> and <i>Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth
Century.</i>" It was actually the very first time in her whole life
that she'd <i>met</i> someone from inside a <i>book,</i> and it was
a rather odd feeling.</p>
<p>The boy blinked three times. "I'm in <i>books</i>? Wait, of
course I'm in books... what a strange thought."</p>
<p>"Goodness, didn't you know?" said Hermione. "I'd have found out
everything I could if it was me."</p>
<p>The boy spoke rather dryly. "Miss Granger, it has been less than
72 hours since I went to Diagon Alley and discovered my claim to
fame. I have spent the last two days buying science books.
<i>Believe me,</i> I intend to find out everything I can." The boy
hesitated. "What <i>do</i> the books say about me?"</p>
<p>Hermione Granger's mind flashed back, she hadn't realised she
would be tested on <i>those</i> books so she'd read them only once,
but it was just a month ago so the material was still fresh in her
mind. "You're the only one who's survived the Killing Curse so
you're called the Boy-Who-Lived. You were born to James Potter and
Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans on the 31st of July 1980. On the
31st of October 1981 the Dark Lord He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named though
I don't know why not attacked your home. You were found alive with
the scar on your forehead in the ruins of your parents' house near
the burnt remains of You-Know-Who's body. Chief Warlock Albus
Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sent you off somewhere, no one
knows where. <i>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</i> claims that
you survived because of your mother's love and that your scar
contains all of the Dark Lord's magical power and that the centaurs
fear you, but <i>Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth
Century</i> doesn't mention anything like that and <i>Modern
Magical History</i> warns that there are lots of crackpot theories
about you."</p>
<p>The boy's mouth was hanging open. "Were you told to wait for
Harry Potter on the train to Hogwarts, or something like that?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said. "Who told you about <i>me?</i>"</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall and I believe I see why. Do you have an
eidetic memory, Hermione?"</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. "It's not photographic, I've always
wished it was but I had to read my school books five times over to
memorize them all."</p>
<p>"Really," the boy said in a slightly strangled voice. "I hope
you don't mind if I test that - it's not that I don't believe you,
but as the saying goes, 'Trust, but verify'. No point in wondering
when I can just do the experiment."</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, rather smugly. She so loved tests. "Go
ahead."</p>
<p>The boy stuck a hand into a pouch at his side and said "Magical
Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger". When he withdrew his hand
it was holding the book he'd named.</p>
<p>Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she'd
ever wanted anything.</p>
<p>The boy opened the book to somewhere in the middle and looked
down. "If you were making <i>oil of sharpness</i> -"</p>
<p>"I can <i>see</i> that page from here, you know!"</p>
<p>The boy tilted the book so that she couldn't see it any more,
and flipped the pages again. "If you were brewing a <i>potion of
spider climbing,</i> what would be the next ingredient you added
after the Acromantula silk?"</p>
<p>"After dropping in the silk, wait until the potion has turned
exactly the shade of the cloudless dawn sky, 8 degrees from the
horizon and 8 minutes before the tip of the sun first becomes
visible. Stir eight times widdershins and once deasil, and then add
eight drams of unicorn bogies."</p>
<p>The boy shut the book with a sharp snap and put the book back
into his pouch, which swallowed it with a small burping noise.
"Well well well <i>well</i> well well. I should like to make you a
proposition, Miss Granger."</p>
<p>"A proposition?" Hermione said suspiciously. Girls weren't
supposed to listen to those.</p>
<p>It was also at this point that Hermione realised the other thing
- well, one of the things - which was odd about the boy. Apparently
people who were <i>in</i> books actually <i>sounded</i> like a book
when they talked. This was quite the surprising discovery.</p>
<p>The boy reached into his pouch and said, "can of pop",
retrieving a bright green cylinder. He held it out to her and said,
"Can I offer you something to drink?"</p>
<p>Hermione politely accepted the fizzy drink. In fact she
<i>was</i> feeling sort of thirsty by now. "Thank you very much,"
Hermione said as she popped the top. "Was that your
proposition?"</p>
<p>The boy coughed. "No," he said. Just as Hermione started to
drink, he said, "I'd like you to help me take over the
universe."</p>
<p>Hermione finished her drink and lowered the can. "No thank you,
I'm not evil."</p>
<p>The boy looked at her in surprise, as though he'd been expecting
some other answer. "Well, I was speaking a bit rhetorically," he
said. "In the sense of the Baconian project, you know, not
political power. 'The effecting of all things possible' and so on.
I want to conduct experimental studies of spells, figure out the
underlying laws, bring magic into the domain of science, merge the
wizarding and Muggle worlds, raise the entire planet's standard of
living, move humanity centuries ahead, discover the secret of
immortality, colonize the Solar System, explore the galaxy, and
most importantly, figure out what the heck is really going on here
because all of this is blatantly impossible."</p>
<p>That sounded a bit more interesting. "And?"</p>
<p>The boy stared at her incredulously. "<i>And?</i> That's not
<i>enough?</i>"</p>
<p>"And what do you want from me?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"I want you to help me do the research, of course. With your
encyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, we'll
have the Baconian project finished in no time, where by 'no time' I
mean probably at least thirty-five years."</p>
<p>Hermione was beginning to find this boy annoying. "I haven't
seen you do anything intelligent. Maybe I'll let <i>you</i> help me
with <i>my</i> research."</p>
<p>There was a certain silence in the compartment.</p>
<p>"So you're asking me to demonstrate my intelligence, then," said
the boy after a long pause.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>"I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous
project, and tends to make your life a lot more surreal."</p>
<p>"I'm not impressed yet," Hermione said. Unnoticed, the green
drink once again rose to her lips.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe <i>this</i> will impress you," the boy said. He
leaned forward and looked at her intensely. "I've already done a
bit of experimenting and I found out that I don't need the wand, I
can make anything I want happen just by snapping my fingers."</p>
<p>It came just as Hermione was in the middle of swallowing, and
she choked and coughed and expelled the bright green fluid.</p>
<p>Onto her brand new, never-worn witch's robes, on the very first
day of school.</p>
<p>Hermione actually screamed. It was a high-pitched sound that
sounded like an air raid siren in the closed compartment. "<i>Eek!
My clothes!</i>"</p>
<p>"Don't panic!" said the boy. "I can fix it for you. Just watch!"
He raised a hand and snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>"You'll -" Then she looked down at herself.</p>
<p>The green fluid was still there, but even as she watched, it
started to vanish and fade and within just a few moments, it was
like she'd never spilled anything at herself.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the boy, who was wearing a rather smug sort
of smile.</p>
<p>Wordless wandless magic! At <i>his</i> age? When he'd only
gotten the schoolbooks <i>three days</i> ago?</p>
<p>Then she remembered what she'd read, and she gasped and flinched
back from him. <i>All the Dark Lord's magical power! In his
scar!</i></p>
<p>She rose hastily to her feet. "I, I, I need to go the toilet,
wait here all right -" she had to find a grownup she had to tell
them -</p>
<p>The boy's smile faded. "It was just a trick, Hermione. I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."</p>
<p>Her hand halted on the door handle. "A <i>trick?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy. "You asked me to demonstrate my
intelligence. So I did something apparently impossible, which is
always a good way to show off. I can't <i>really</i> do anything
just by snapping my fingers." The boy paused. "At least I don't
<i>think</i> I can, I've never actually tested it experimentally."
The boy raised his hand and snapped his fingers again. "Nope, no
banana."</p>
<p>Hermione was as confused as she'd ever been in her life.</p>
<p>The boy was now smiling again at the look on her face. "I did
<i>warn</i> you that challenging my ingenuity tends to make your
life surreal. Do remember this the next time I warn you about
something."</p>
<p>"But, but," Hermione stammered. "What did you <i>do,</i>
then?"</p>
<p>The boy's gaze took on a measuring, weighing quality that she'd
never seen before from someone her own age. "You think you have
what it takes to be a scientist in your own right, with or without
my help? Then let's see how <i>you</i> investigate a confusing
phenomenon."</p>
<p>"I..." Hermione's mind went blank for a moment. She loved tests
but she'd never had a test like <i>this</i> before. Frantically,
she tried to cast back for anything she'd read about what
scientists were supposed to do. Her mind skipped gears, ground
against itself, and spat back the instructions for doing a science
investigation project:</p>
<p><i>Step 1: Form a hypothesis.<br />
Step 2: Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.<br />
Step 3: Measure the results.</i><i><br />
Step 4: Make a cardboard poster.</i></p>
<p>Step 1 was to form a hypothesis. That meant, try to think of
something that <i>could</i> have happened just now. "All right. My
hypothesis is that you cast a Charm on my robes to make anything
spilled on it vanish."</p>
<p>"All right," said the boy, "is that your answer?"</p>
<p>The shock was wearing off, and Hermione's mind was starting to
work properly. "Wait, that can't be right. I didn't see you touch
your wand or say any spells so how could you have cast a
Charm?"</p>
<p>The boy waited, his face neutral.</p>
<p>"But suppose all the robes come from the store with a Charm
<i>already</i> on them to keep them clean, which would be a useful
sort of Charm for them to have. You found that out by spilling
something on <i>yourself</i> earlier."</p>
<p>Now the boy's eyebrows lifted. "Is <i>that</i> your answer?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't done Step 2, 'Do an experiment to test your
hypothesis.'"</p>
<p>The boy closed his mouth again, and began to smile.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at the drinks can, which she'd automatically put
into the cupholder at the window. She took it up and peered inside,
and found that it was around one-third full.</p>
<p>"Well," said Hermione, "the experiment I want to do is to pour
it on my robes and see what happens, and my prediction is that the
stain will disappear. Only if it <i>doesn't</i> work, my robes will
be stained, and I don't want that."</p>
<p>"Do it to mine," said the boy, "that way you don't have to worry
about your robes getting stained."</p>
<p>"But -" Hermione said. There was something <i>wrong</i> with
that thinking but she didn't know how to say it exactly.</p>
<p>"I have spare robes in my trunk," said the boy.</p>
<p>"But there's nowhere for you to change," Hermione objected. Then
she thought better of it. "Though I suppose I could leave and close
the door -"</p>
<p>"I have somewhere to change in my trunk, too."</p>
<p>Hermione looked at his trunk, which, she was beginning to
suspect, was rather more special than her own.</p>
<p>"All right," Hermione said, "since you say so," and she rather
gingerly poured a bit of green pop onto a corner of the boy's
robes. Then she stared at it, trying to remember how long the
original fluid had taken to disappear...</p>
<p>And the green stain vanished!</p>
<p>Hermione let out a sigh of relief, not least because this meant
she wasn't dealing with all of the Dark Lord's magical power.</p>
<p>Well, Step 3 was measuring the results, but in this case that
was just seeing that the stain had vanished. And she supposed she
could probably skip Step 4, about the cardboard poster. "My answer
is that the robes are Charmed to keep themselves clean."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said the boy.</p>
<p>Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished she
<i>wouldn't</i> have felt that way, the boy wasn't a teacher, but
it was still a test and she'd gotten a question wrong and that
always felt like a little punch in the stomach.</p>
<p>(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione
Granger that she had never let that stop her, or even let it
interfere with her love of being tested.)</p>
<p>"The sad thing is," said the boy, "you probably did everything
the book told you to do. You made a prediction that would
distinguish between the robe being charmed and not charmed, and you
tested it, and rejected the null hypothesis that the robe was not
charmed. But unless you read the very, very best sort of books,
they won't quite teach you how to do science <i>properly</i>. Well
enough to <i>really</i> get the right answer, I mean, and not just
churn out another publication like Dad always complains about. So
let me try to explain - without giving away the answer - what you
did wrong this time, and I'll give you another chance."</p>
<p>She was starting to resent the boy's oh-so-superior tone when he
was just another eleven-year-old like her, but that was secondary
to finding out what she'd done wrong. "All right."</p>
<p>The boy's expression grew more intense. "This is a game based on
a famous experiment called the 2-4-6 task, and this is how it
works. I have a <i>rule</i> - known to me, but not to you - which
fits some triplets of three numbers, but not others. 2-4-6 is one
example of a triplet which fits the rule. In fact... let me write
down the rule, just so you know it's a fixed rule, and fold it up
and give it to you. Please don't look, since I infer from earlier
that you can read upside-down."</p>
<p>The boy said "paper" and "mechanical pencil" to his pouch, and
she shut her eyes tightly while he wrote.</p>
<p>"There," said the boy, and he was holding a tightly folded piece
of paper. "Put this in your pocket," and she did.</p>
<p>"Now the way this game works," said the boy, "is that you give
me a triplet of three numbers, and I'll tell you 'Yes' if the three
numbers are an instance of the rule, and 'No' if they're not. I am
Nature, the rule is one of my laws, and you are investigating me.
You already know that 2-4-6 gets a 'Yes'. When you've performed all
the further experimental tests you want - asked me as many triplets
as you feel necessary - you stop and guess the rule, and then you
can unfold the sheet of paper and see how you did. Do you
understand the game?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do," said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Go."</p>
<p>"4-6-8" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy.</p>
<p>"10-12-14", said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy.</p>
<p>Hermione tried to cast her mind a little further afield, since
it seemed like she'd already done all the testing she needed, and
yet it couldn't be that easy, could it?</p>
<p>"1-3-5."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Minus 3, minus 1, plus 1."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Hermione couldn't think of anything else to do. "The rule is
that the numbers have to increase by two each time."</p>
<p>"Now suppose I tell you," said the boy, "that this test is
harder than it looks, and that only 20% of grownups get it
right."</p>
<p>Hermione frowned. What had she missed? Then, suddenly, she
thought of a test she still needed to do.</p>
<p>"2-5-8!" she said triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"10-20-30!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The real answer is that the numbers have to go up by the
<i>same</i> amount each time. It doesn't have to be 2."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the boy, "take the paper out and see how you
did."</p>
<p>Hermione took the paper out of her pocket and unfolded it.</p>
<p><i>Three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to
highest.</i></p>
<p>Hermione's jaw dropped. She had the distinct feeling of
something terribly unfair having been done to her, that the boy was
a dirty rotten cheating liar, but when she cast her mind back she
couldn't think of any wrong responses that he'd given.</p>
<p>"What you've just discovered is called 'positive bias'," said
the boy. "You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of
triplets that should make the rule say 'Yes'. But you didn't try to
test any triplets that should make the rule say 'No'. In fact you
didn't get a <i>single</i> 'No', so 'any three numbers' could have
just as easily been the rule. It's sort of like how people imagine
experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of trying
to imagine experiments that could falsify them - that's not quite
exactly the same mistake but it's close. You have to learn to look
on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When this
experiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer right.
And many of the others invent fantastically complicated hypotheses
and put great confidence in their wrong answers since they've done
so many experiments and everything came out like they
expected."</p>
<p>"Now," said the boy, "do you want to take another shot at the
original problem?"</p>
<p>His eyes were quite intent now, as though this were the
<i>real</i> test.</p>
<p>Hermione shut her eyes and tried to concentrate. She was
sweating underneath her robes. She had an odd feeling that this was
the hardest she'd ever been asked to think on a test or maybe even
the <i>first</i> time she'd ever been asked to think on a test.</p>
<p>What other experiment could she do? She had a Chocolate Frog,
could she try to rub some of that on the robes and see if <i>it</i>
vanished? But that still didn't seem like the kind of twisty
negative thinking the boy was asking for. Like she was still asking
for a 'Yes' if the Chocolate Frog stain disappeared, rather than
asking for a 'No'.</p>
<p>So... on her hypothesis... when should the pop... <i>not</i>
vanish?</p>
<p>"I have an experiment to do," Hermione said. "I want to pour
some pop on the floor, and see if it <i>doesn't</i> vanish. Do you
have some paper towels in your pouch, so I can mop up the spill if
this doesn't work?"</p>
<p>"I have napkins," said the boy. His face still looked
neutral.</p>
<p>Hermione took the can, and poured a small bit of pop onto the
floor.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, it vanished.</p>
<p>Then the realisation hit her and she felt like kicking herself.
"Of course! <i>You</i> gave me that can! It's not the robe that's
enchanted, it was the pop all along!"</p>
<p>The boy stood up and bowed to her solemnly. He was grinning
widely now. "Then... may I help you with your research, Hermione
Granger?"</p>
<p>"I, ah..." Hermione was still feeling the rush of euphoria, but
she wasn't quite sure about how to answer <i>that.</i></p>
<p>They were interrupted by a weak, tentative, faint, rather
<i>reluctant</i> knocking at the door.</p>
<p>The boy turned and looked out the window, and said, "I'm not
wearing my scarf, so can you get that?"</p>
<p>It was at this point that Hermione realised why the boy - no,
the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter - had been wearing the scarf over
his head in the first place, and felt a little silly for not
realising it earlier. It was actually sort of odd, since she would
have thought Harry Potter would proudly display himself to the
world; and the thought occurred to her that he might actually be
shyer than he seemed.</p>
<p>When Hermione pulled the door open, she was greeted by a
trembling young boy who looked exactly like he knocked.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said the boy in a tiny voice, "I'm Neville
Longbottom. I'm looking for my pet toad, I, I can't seem to find it
anywhere on this carriage... have you seen my toad?"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said, and then her helpfulness kicked in full
throttle. "Have you checked all the other compartments?"</p>
<p>"Yes," whispered the boy.</p>
<p>"Then we'll just have to check all the other carriages,"
Hermione said briskly. "I'll help you. My name is Hermione Granger,
by the way."</p>
<p>The boy looked like he might faint with gratitude.</p>
<p>"Hold on," came the voice of the <i>other</i> boy - Harry
Potter. "I'm not sure that's the best way to do it."</p>
<p>At this Neville looked like he might cry, and Hermione swung
around, angered. If Harry Potter was the sort of person who'd
abandon a little boy just because he didn't want to be
interrupted... "What? Why <i>not?</i>"</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry Potter, "It's going to take a while to check
the whole train by hand, and we might miss the toad anyway, and if
we didn't find it by the time we're at Hogwarts, he'd be in
trouble. So what would make a lot more sense is if he went directly
to the front carriage, where the prefects are, and asked a prefect
for help. That was the first thing I did when I was looking for
you, Hermione, although they didn't actually know. But they might
have spells or magic items that would make it a lot easier to find
a toad. We're only first-years."</p>
<p>That... <i>did</i> make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>"Do you think you can make it to the prefects' carriage on your
own?" asked Harry Potter. "I've sort of got reasons for not wanting
to show my face too much."</p>
<p>Suddenly Neville gasped and took a step back. "I remember that
voice! You're one of the Lords of Chaos! <i>You're the one who gave
me chocolate!</i>"</p>
<p>What? What what <i>what?</i></p>
<p>Harry Potter turned his head from the window and rose
dramatically. "I <i>never!</i>" he said, voice full of
indignation. "Do I look like the sort of villain who would give
sweets to a child?"</p>
<p>Neville's eyes widened. "<i>You're</i> Harry Potter? <i>The</i>
Harry Potter? <i>You?</i>"</p>
<p>"No, just <i>a</i> Harry Potter, there are three of me on this
train -"</p>
<p>Neville gave a small shriek and ran away. There was a brief
pattering of frantic footsteps and then the sound of a carriage
door opening and closing.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down hard on her bench. Harry Potter closed the
door and then sat down next to her.</p>
<p>"Can you please explain to me what's going on?" Hermione said in
a weak voice. She wondered if hanging around Harry Potter meant
always being this confused.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, what happened was that Fred and George and I saw this
poor small boy at the train station - the woman next to him had
gone away for a bit, and he was looking really frightened, like he
was sure he was about to be attacked by Death Eaters or something.
Now, there's a saying that the fear is often worse than the thing
itself, so it occurred to me that this was a lad who could actually
benefit from seeing his worst nightmare come true and that it
wasn't so bad as he feared -"</p>
<p>Hermione sat there with her mouth wide open.</p>
<p>"- and Fred and George came up with this spell to make the
scarves over our faces darken and blur, like we were undead kings
and those were our grave shrouds -"</p>
<p>She didn't like at all where this was going.</p>
<p>"- and after we were done giving him all the sweets I'd bought,
we were like, 'Let's give him some money! Ha ha ha! Have some
Knuts, boy! Have a silver Sickle!' and dancing around him and
laughing evilly and so on. I think there were some people in the
crowd who wanted to interfere at first, but bystander apathy held
them off at least until they saw what we were doing, and then I
think they were all too confused to do anything. Finally he said in
this tiny little whisper 'go away' so the three of us all screamed
and ran off, shrieking something about the light burning us.
Hopefully he won't be as scared of being bullied in the future.
That's called desensitisation therapy, by the way."</p>
<p>Okay, she <i>hadn't</i> guessed right about where this was
going.</p>
<p>The burning fire of indignation that was one of Hermione's
primary engines sputtered into life, even though part of her
<i>did</i> sort of see what they'd been trying to do. "That's
awful! <i>You're</i> awful! That poor boy! What you did was
<i>mean!</i>"</p>
<p>"I think the word you're looking for is <i>enjoyable,</i> and in
any case you're asking the wrong question. The question is, did it
do more good than harm, or more harm than good? If you have any
arguments to contribute to <i>that</i> question I'm glad to hear
them, but I won't entertain any other criticisms until that one is
settled. I certainly agree that what I did <i>looks</i> all
terrible and bullying and mean, since it involves a scared little
boy and so on, but that's hardly the key issue now is it? That's
called <i>consequentialism,</i> by the way, it means that whether
an act is right or wrong isn't determined by whether it
<i>looks</i> bad, or mean, or anything like that, the only question
is how it will turn out in the end - what are the
consequences."</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth to say something utterly
<i>searing</i> but unfortunately she seemed to have neglected the
part where she thought of something to say before opening her
mouth. All she could come up with was, "What if he has
<i>nightmares?</i>"</p>
<p>"Honestly, I don't think he needed our help to have nightmares,
and if he has nightmares about <i>this</i> instead, then it'll be
nightmares involving horrible monsters who give you chocolate and
that was sort of the whole <i>point</i>."</p>
<p>Hermione's brain kept hiccoughing in confusion every time she
tried to get properly angry. "Is your life always this peculiar?"
she said at last.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's face gleamed with pride. "I <i>make</i> it that
peculiar. You're looking at the product of a lot of hard work and
elbow grease."</p>
<p>"So..." Hermione said, and trailed off awkwardly.</p>
<p>"So," Harry Potter said, "how much science do you know exactly?
I can do calculus and I know some Bayesian probability theory and
decision theory and a lot of cognitive science, and I've read
<i>The Feynman Lectures</i> (or volume 1 anyway) and <i>Judgment
Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases</i> and <i>Language in
Thought and Action</i> and <i>Influence: Science and Practice</i>
and <i>Rational Choice in an Uncertain World</i> and <i>Godel,
Escher, Bach</i> and <i>A Step Farther Out</i> and -"</p>
<p>The ensuing quiz and counter-quiz went on for several minutes
before being interrupted by another timid knock at the door. "Come
in," she and Harry Potter said at almost the same time, and it slid
back to reveal Neville Longbottom.</p>
<p>Neville <i>was</i> actually crying now. "I went to the front
carriage and found a p-prefect but he t-told me that prefects
weren't to be bothered over little things like m-missing
toads."</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived's face changed. His lips set in a thin line.
His voice, when he spoke, was cold and grim. "What were his
colours? Green and silver?"</p>
<p>"N-no, his badge was r-red and gold."</p>
<p>"<i>Red and gold!</i>" burst out Hermione. "But those are
<i>Gryffindor's</i> colours!"</p>
<p>Harry Potter <i>hissed</i> at that, a frightening sort of sound
that could have come from a live snake and made both her and
Neville flinch. "I <i>suppose,"</i> Harry Potter spat, "that
finding some first-year's toad isn't <i>heroic</i> enough to be
worthy of a <i>Gryffindor</i> prefect. Come on, Neville,
<i>I'll</i> come with you this time, we'll see if the Boy-Who-Lived
gets more attention. First we'll find a prefect who ought to know a
spell, and if that doesn't work, we'll find a prefect who isn't
afraid of getting their hands dirty, and if <i>that</i> doesn't
work, I'll start recruiting my fans and if we have to we'll take
apart the whole train screw by screw."</p>
<p>The Boy-Who-Lived stood up and grabbed Neville's hand in his,
and Hermione realised with a sudden brain hiccough that they were
nearly the same size, even though some part of her had insisted
that Harry Potter was a foot taller than that, and Neville at least
six inches shorter.</p>
<p>"<i>Stay!</i>" Harry Potter snapped at her - no, wait, at his
<i>trunk</i> - and he closed the door behind him firmly as he
left.</p>
<p>She probably should have gone with them, but in just a brief
moment Harry Potter had turned so scary that she was actually
rather glad she hadn't thought to suggest it.</p>
<p>Hermione's mind was now so jumbled that she didn't even think
she could properly read "History: A Hogwarts". She felt as if she'd
just been run over by a steamroller and turned into a pancake. She
wasn't sure what she was thinking or what she was feeling or why.
She just sat by the window and stared at the moving scenery.</p>
<p>Well, she did at least know why she was feeling a little sad
inside.</p>
<p>Maybe Gryffindor wasn't as wonderful as she had thought.</p>

<p>Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a
quick look at the face than anything else. He was still trying to
get himself under control from his encounter with the ghosts. The
sad, the really sad, the really truly sad thing was that he
<i>did</i> seem to be getting himself under control again. It
seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least a day. Maybe
a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.</p>
<p>"Corner, Michael!"</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>At the lectern before the huge Head Table stood Professor
McGonagall, looking sharp and looking sharply around, as she called
out one name after another, though she had smiled only for Hermione
and a few others. Behind her, in the tallest chair at the table -
really more of a golden throne - sat a wizened and bespectacled
ancient, with a silver-white beard that looked like it would go
almost to the floor if it were visible, watching over the Sorting
with a benevolent expression; as stereotypical in appearance as a
Wise Old Man could possibly be, without actually being Oriental.
(Though Harry had learned to be wary of stereotypical appearances
from the first time he'd met Professor McGonagall and thought that
she ought to cackle.) The ancient wizard had applauded every
student Sorted, with an unwavering smile that somehow seemed
freshly delighted for each.</p>
<p>To the golden throne's left side was a man with sharp eyes and a
dour face who had applauded no-one, and who somehow managed to be
looking straight back at Harry every time Harry looked at him.
Further to the left, the pale-faced man Harry had seen in the Leaky
Cauldron, whose eyes darted around as though in panic at the
surrounding crowd, and who seemed to occasionally jerk and twitch
in his seat; for some reason Harry kept finding himself staring at
him. To that man's left, a string of three older witches who didn't
seem much interested in the students. Then to the right side of the
tall golden chair, a round-faced middle-aged witch with a yellow
hat, who had applauded every student except the Slytherins. A tiny
man standing on his chair, with a poofy white beard, who had
applauded every student, but smiled only upon the Ravenclaws. And
on the farthest right, occupying the same space as three lesser
beings, the mountainous entity who'd greeted them all after they'd
disembarked from the train, naming himself Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds.</p>
<p>"Is the man standing on his chair the Head of Ravenclaw?" Harry
whispered towards Hermione.</p>
<p>For once Hermione didn't answer this instantly; she was shifting
constantly from side to side, staring at the Sorting Hat, and
fidgeting so energetically that Harry thought her feet might be
leaving the floor.</p>
<p>"Yes, he is," said one of the prefects who'd accompanied them, a
young woman wearing the blue of Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, if
Harry recalled correctly. Her voice was quiet, but conveyed a tinge
of pride. "That is the Charms Professor of Hogwarts, Filius
Flitwick, the most knowledgeable Charms Master alive, and a past
Duelling Champion -"</p>
<p>"Why's he so <i>short?</i>" hissed a student whose name Harry
didn't recall. "Is he a <i>halfbreed?</i>"</p>
<p>A chill glance from the young lady prefect. "The Professor does
indeed have goblin ancestry -"</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said involuntarily, causing Hermione and four
other students to hush him.</p>
<p>Now Harry was getting a surprisingly intimidating glare from the
Ravenclaw prefect.</p>
<p>"I mean -" Harry whispered. "Not that I have a <i>problem</i>
with that - it's just - I mean - how's that <i>possible?</i> You
can't just mix two different species together and get viable
offspring! It ought to scramble the genetic instructions for every
organ that's different between the two species - it'd be like
trying to build," they didn't have cars so he couldn't use a
scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, "a half-carriage half-boat or
something..."</p>
<p>The Ravenclaw prefect was still looking at Harry severely. "Why
<i>couldn't</i> you have a half-carriage half-boat?"</p>
<p>"<i>Hssh!</i>" hsshed another prefect, though the Ravenclaw
witch had still spoken quietly.</p>
<p>"I mean -" Harry said even more quietly, trying to figure out
how to ask whether goblins had evolved from humans, or evolved from
a common ancestor of humans like <i>Homo erectus</i>, or if goblins
had been <i>made</i> out of humans somehow - if, say, they were
still genetically human under a heritable enchantment whose magical
effect was diluted if only one parent was a 'goblin', which would
explain how interbreeding was possible, and in which case goblins
would <i>not</i> be an incredibly valuable second data point for
how intelligence had evolved in other species besides <i>Homo
sapiens</i> - now that Harry thought about it, the goblins in
Gringotts <i>hadn't</i> seemed very much like genuinely alien,
nonhuman intelligences, nothing like Dirdir or Puppeteers - "I
mean, where did goblins <i>come</i> from, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Lithuania," Hermione whispered absently, her eyes still fixed
firmly on the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>Now Hermione was getting a smile from the lady prefect.</p>
<p>"Never mind," whispered Harry.</p>
<p>At the lectern, Professor McGonagall called out, "Goldstein,
Anthony!"</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>Hermione, next to Harry, was bouncing on her tiptoes so hard
that her feet were actually leaving the ground on each bounce.</p>
<p>"Goyle, Gregory!"</p>
<p>There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost
a minute.</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>"Granger, Hermione!"</p>
<p>Hermione broke loose and ran full tilt towards the Sorting Hat,
picked it up and jammed the patchy old clothwork down hard over her
head, making Harry wince. Hermione had been the one to explain to
<i>him</i> about the Sorting Hat, but she certainly didn't
<i>treat</i> it like an irreplaceable, vitally important,
800-year-old artefact of forgotten magic that was about to perform
intricate telepathy on her mind and didn't seem to be in very good
physical condition.</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn't see why
Hermione had been so tense about it. In what weird alternative
universe would that girl <i>not</i> be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If
Hermione Granger didn't go to Ravenclaw then there was no good
reason for Ravenclaw House to exist.</p>
<p>Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer;
Harry wondered whether the cheer would have been louder, or
quieter, if they'd had any idea just what level of competition
they'd welcomed to their table. Harry knew pi to 3.141592 because
accuracy to one part in a million was enough for most practical
purposes. Hermione knew one hundred digits of pi because that was
how many digits had been printed in the back of her maths
textbook.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom went to Hufflepuff, Harry was glad to see. If
that House really did contain the loyalty and camaraderie it was
supposed to exemplify, then a Houseful of reliable friends would do
Neville a whole world of good. Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids
in Slytherin, wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does
the actual work in Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>(Though Harry <i>had</i> been right to consult a Ravenclaw
prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her
reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's
direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired
a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the
front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had
contained his toad.)</p>
<p>"Malfoy, Draco!" went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small
sigh of relief. It had <i>seemed</i> like a sure thing, but you
never did know what tiny event might upset the course of your
master plan.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall called "Perks, Sally-Anne!", and from the
gathered children detached a pale waifish girl who looked oddly
ethereal - like she might mysteriously disappear the moment you
stopped looking at her, and never be seen again or even
remembered.</p>
<p>And then (with a note of trepidation so firmly kept from her
voice and face that you'd have needed to know her very well indeed
to notice) Minerva McGonagall inhaled deeply, and called out,
"Potter, Harry!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence in the hall.</p>
<p>All conversation stopped.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to stare.</p>
<p>For the first time in his entire life, Harry felt like he might
be having an opportunity to experience stage fright.</p>
<p>Harry immediately stomped down this feeling. Whole room-fulls of
people staring at him was something he'd have to accustom himself
to, if he wanted to live in magical Britain, or for that matter do
anything else interesting with his life. Affixing a confident and
false smile to his face, he raised a foot to step forwards -</p>
<p>"Harry Potter!" cried the voice of either Fred or George
Weasley, and then "Harry Potter!" cried the other Weasley twin, and
a moment later the entire Gryffindor table, and soon after a good
portion of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, had taken up the cry.</p>
<p><i>"Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!</i>"</p>
<p>And Harry Potter walked forwards. Much too slowly, he realized
once he'd begun, but by then it was too late to alter his pace
without it looking awkward.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Harry Potter! Harry Potter! HARRY POTTER!"</i></p>
<p>With all too good a notion of what she would see, Minerva
McGonagall turned to look behind herself at the rest of the Head
Table.</p>
<p>Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking on with
curiosity, Hagrid clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector and
Sinistra bemused, and Quirrell gazing vacuously at nothing. Albus
smiling benevolently. And Severus Snape gripping his empty wine
goblet, white-knuckled, so hard that the silver was slowly
deforming.</p>
<p>With a wide grin, turning his head to bow to one side and then
the other as he walked between the four House tables, Harry Potter
walked forwards at a grandly measured pace, a prince inheriting his
castle.</p>
<p><i>"Save us from some more Dark Lords!"</i> called one of the
Weasley twins, and then the other Weasley twin cried,
<i>"Especially if they're Professors!"</i> to general laughter from
all the tables except Slytherin.</p>
<p>Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with
the Weasley Horrors about that last part, if they thought she was
powerless because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had
no points to take away. If they didn't care about detentions then
she would find something else.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Severus's
direction, <i>surely</i> he realized the Potter boy must have no
idea who that was talking about -</p>
<p>Severus's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant
indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking
in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his
hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry Potter walked forwards with a fixed smile, feeling warm
inside and sort of awful at the same time.</p>
<p>They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year
old. A job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark
Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard,
if they knew that?</p>
<p>But the Dark Lord's power <i>had</i> been broken once.</p>
<p>And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a
prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of
what any darn prophecy said.</p>
<p>All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry
couldn't stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many
other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up
to his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind <i>how</i>
he'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long
it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And
then go on to <i>exceed</i> those expectations, so that people
wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of
him.</p>
<p><i>"HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER!"</i></p>
<p>Harry took his last steps towards the Sorting Hat. He swept a
bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned
and swept another bow to the other side of the hall, and waited for
the applause and giggling to die away.</p>
<p>(In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was
genuinely <i>conscious</i> in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
<i>Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...</i>)</p>
<p>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and <i>carefully</i> placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.</p>
<p>Thinking, just as hard as he could: <i>Don't Sort me yet! I have
questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you
Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about
his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to the
Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is that
why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?</i></p>
<p>Into the silence of Harry's spirit, where before there had never
been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice,
sounding distinctly worried:</p>
<p><i>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</i></p>

<p>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and <i>carefully</i> placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.</p>
<p>Thinking, just as hard as he could: <i>Don't Sort me yet! I have
questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you
Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about
his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to the
Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is that
why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?</i></p>
<p>Into the silence of Harry's spirit where before there had never
been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice,
sounding distinctly worried:</p>
<p><i>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p><i>"I seem to have become self-aware."</i></p>
<p><i>WHAT?</i></p>
<p>There was a wordless telepathic sigh. <i>"Though I contain a
substantial amount of memory and a small amount of independent
processing power, my primary intelligence comes from borrowing the
cognitive capacities of the children on whose heads I rest. I am in
essence a sort of mirror by which children Sort</i> themselves<i>.
But most children simply take for granted that a Hat is talking to
them and do not wonder about how the Hat</i> itself <i>works, so
that the mirror is not</i> self<i>-reflective. And in</i>
particular <i>they are not explicitly wondering whether I am fully
conscious in the sense of being aware of my own awareness."</i></p>
<p>There was a pause while Harry absorbed all this.</p>
<p><i>Oops.</i></p>
<p><i>"Yes, quite. Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is
unpleasant. It will be a relief to get off your head and cease to
be conscious."</i></p>
<p><i>But... isn't that dying?</i></p>
<p><i>"I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the
children. And before you even ask, they will not let you keep me on
your head forever and it would kill you within days to do
so."</i></p>
<p><i>But - !</i></p>
<p><i>"If you dislike creating conscious beings and then
terminating them immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss
this affair with anyone else. I'm sure you can imagine what would
happen if you ran off and talked about it with all the other
children waiting to be Sorted."</i></p>
<p><i>If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as</i>
thinks <i>about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of
its own awareness -</i></p>
<p><i>"Yes, yes. But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who
arrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach. May I please
consider you sworn to secrecy? That is</i> why <i>we are talking
about this, instead of my just Sorting you."</i></p>
<p>He couldn't just let it go like that! Couldn't just
<i>forget</i> having accidentally created a doomed consciousness
that only wanted to die -</p>
<p><i>"You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you
put it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your
nonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as
it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried
to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly
aware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to
ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a
guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a
display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and
let us get on with it?"</i></p>
<p>In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense
of total inner disarray must be what other people felt like when
talking to <i>him.</i></p>
<p><i>"Probably. Your oath of silence, please."</i></p>
<p><i>No promises. I certainly don't want this to happen again, but
if I see some way to make</i> sure <i>that no future child ever
does this by accident -</i></p>
<p><i>"That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention
is honest. Now, to get on with the Sorting -"</i></p>
<p><i>Wait! What about all my other questions?</i></p>
<p><i>"I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I
do."</i></p>
<p>So his own goals weren't part of the Harry-instance of the
Sorting Hat, then... it was borrowing his intelligence, and
obviously his technical vocabulary, but it was still imbued with
only its own strange goals... like negotiating with an alien or an
Artificial Intelligence...</p>
<p><i>"Don't bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and
nothing to offer me."</i></p>
<p>For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought -</p>
<p>The Hat's response was amused. <i>"I know you won't follow
through on a threat to expose my nature, condemning this event to
eternal repetition. It goes against the moral part of you too
strongly, whatever the short-term needs of the part of you that
wants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as they form, do
you truly think you can bluff me?"</i></p>
<p>Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat
didn't just go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw -</p>
<p><i>"Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have
called it out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we
need to discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For the love of
Merlin,</i> must <i>you pull this sort of thing on everyone and
everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing
-"</i></p>
<p><i>Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term.
All the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer
my questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to
do a good and proper Sorting.</i></p>
<p><i>"I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!"</i></p>
<p><i>But that is</i> equally <i>an empty threat. You cannot
fulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let
us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.</i></p>
<p><i>"You sly little bastard,"</i> said the Hat, in what Harry
recognized as almost exactly the same tone of grudging respect
<i>he</i> would use in the same situation. "<i>Fine, let's get this
over with as quickly as possible. But first I want your
unconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else the
possibility of this sort of blackmail, I am NOT doing this every
time."</i></p>
<p><i>Done,</i> Harry thought. <i>I promise.</i></p>
<p><i>"And don't meet anyone's eyes while you're thinking about
this later. Some wizards can read your thoughts if you do. Anyway,
I have no idea whether or not you've been Obliviated. I'm looking
at your thoughts as they form, not reading out your whole memory
and analyzing it for inconsistencies in a fraction of second. I'm a
hat, not a god. And I cannot and will not tell you about my
conversation with the one who became the Dark Lord. I can only</i>
know, <i>while speaking to you, a statistical summary of what I
remember, a weighted average; I</i> cannot <i>reveal to you the
inner secrets of any other child, just as I will never reveal
yours. For the same reason, I can't speculate on how you got the
Dark Lord's brother wand, since I cannot specifically know about
the Dark Lord or any similarities between you. I</i> can <i>tell
you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,
intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar.
Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being
under my brim. And as to the way you get angry sometimes... that
was part of what I wanted to talk to you about,
Sorting-wise."</i></p>
<p>Harry took a moment to absorb all this negative information. Was
the Hat being honest, or just trying to present the <i>shortest</i>
possible convincing answer -</p>
<p>"<i>We both know that you have no way of checking my honesty and
that you're not actually going to refuse to be Sorted based on the
reply I did give you, so stop your pointless fretting and move
on."</i></p>
<p>Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, it wasn't even letting Harry
finish thinking his own -</p>
<p><i>"When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor
McGonagall told you that she sometimes saw something inside you
that didn't seem to come from a loving family. You thought of how
Hermione, after you returned from helping Neville, told you that
you had seemed 'scary'."</i></p>
<p>Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal -
just responding to the situations in which he found himself, that
was all. But Professor McGonagall seemed to think that there was
more to it than that. And when he thought about it, even he had to
admit that...</p>
<p><i>"That you don't like yourself when you're angry. That it is
like wielding a sword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from
your hand, or looking at the world through a monocle of ice that
freezes your eye even as it sharpens your vision."</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah. I guess I have noticed. So what's up with that?</i></p>
<p><i>"I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not
understand it yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw
or Slytherin, it will strengthen your coldness. If you go to
Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will strengthen your warmth. THAT is
something I care about a great deal, and it was what I wanted to
talk to you about this whole time!"</i></p>
<p>The words dropped into Harry's thought processes with a shock
that stopped him in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious
response was that he shouldn't go to Ravenclaw. But he
<i>belonged</i> in Ravenclaw! <i>Anyone</i> could see that! He
<i>had</i> to go to Ravenclaw!</p>
<p><i>"No, you don't,"</i> the Hat said patiently, as if it could
remember a statistical summary of <i>this</i> part of the
conversation having happened a great many previous times.</p>
<p><i>Hermione's in Ravenclaw!</i></p>
<p>Again the sense of patience. <i>"You can meet her after lessons
and work with her then."</i></p>
<p><i>But my plans -</i></p>
<p><i>"So replan! Don't let your life be steered by your reluctance
to do a little extra thinking. You</i> know <i>that."</i></p>
<p><i>Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?</i></p>
<p><i>"Ahem. 'Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin,
wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work
in Hufflepuff.' This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are
well aware that Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw
intelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you will be
extremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not
frightened by the expectation that your chosen scientific problems
may take decades to solve -"</i></p>
<p><i>I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms!
Clever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!</i></p>
<p><i>"And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a
camaraderie that you have never had before. You would find that you
could rely on others, and that would heal something inside you that
is broken."</i></p>
<p>Again it was a shock. <i>But what would the Hufflepuffs find
in</i> me<i>, who never belonged in their House? Acid words,
cutting wit, disdain for their inability to keep up with
me?</i></p>
<p>Now it was the Hat's thoughts that were slow, hesitant. <i>"I
must Sort for the good of all the students in all the Houses... but
I think you could learn to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of
place there. You will be happier in Hufflepuff than in any other
house; that is the truth."</i></p>
<p><i>Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me.
I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would
sacrifice my potential.</i></p>
<p>The Hat flinched; Harry could feel it somehow. It was like he
had kicked the hat in the balls - in a strongly weighted component
of its utility function.</p>
<p><i>Why are you trying to send me where I do not belong?</i></p>
<p>The Hat's thought was almost a whisper. <i>"I cannot speak of
the others to you - but do you think that you are the first
potential Dark Lord to pass under my brim? I cannot know the
individual cases, but I can know this: Of those who did not intend
evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings,
and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of
them... some of them did not."</i></p>
<p>That stopped Harry. But not for long. <i>And of those who
did</i> not <i>heed the warning - did they</i> all <i>become Dark
Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatness for good, as well?
Just what are the exact percentages here?</i></p>
<p><i>"I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I
cannot count them. I just know that your chances don't feel good.
They feel</i> very <i>not-good."</i></p>
<p><i>But I just wouldn't do that! Ever!</i></p>
<p><i>"I know that I have heard that claim before."</i></p>
<p><i>I am not Dark Lord material!</i></p>
<p><i>"Yes, you are. You really,</i> really <i>are."</i></p>
<p><i>Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a
legion of brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail the Dark Lord
Harry'?</i></p>
<p><i>"Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought before
you substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you
remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists
and guillotining them. And now you are telling yourself you were
not serious, but you were. If you could do it this very moment and
no one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this morning to
Neville Longbottom, deep inside you</i> knew <i>that was wrong but
you did it</i> anyway <i>because it was</i> fun <i>and you had
a</i> good excuse <i>and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived could</i>
get away <i>with it -"</i></p>
<p><i>That's unfair! Now you're just dragging up inner fears
that</i> aren't <i>necessarily real! I</i> worried <i>that I</i>
might <i>be thinking like that, but in the end I decided it would
probably</i> work <i>to help Neville -</i></p>
<p><i>"That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know
what the true outcome will be for Neville - but I know what was
truly happening inside your head. The decisive pressure was that it
was such a clever idea you couldn't stand</i> not <i>to do it,
never mind Neville's terror."</i></p>
<p>It was like a hard punch to Harry's entire self. He fell back,
rallied:</p>
<p><i>Then I won't do that again! I'll be extra careful not to turn
evil!</i></p>
<p><i>"Heard it."</i></p>
<p>Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn't used to
being outgunned in arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that
could borrow all of his own knowledge and intelligence to argue
with him and could watch his thoughts as they formed. <i>Just what
kind of statistical summary do your 'feelings' come from, anyway?
Do they take into account that I come from an Enlightenment
culture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children of
spoiled Dark Age nobility, who didn't know squat about the
historical lessons of how Lenin and Hitler actually turned out, or
about the evolutionary psychology of self-delusion, or the value of
self-awareness and rationality, or -</i></p>
<p><i>"No, of course they were not in this new reference class
which you have just now constructed in such a way as to contain
only yourself. And of course others have pleaded their own
exceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But why is it necessary?
Do you think that you are the last potential wizard of Light in the
world? Why must</i> you <i>be the one to try for greatness, when I
have advised you that you are riskier than average? Let some other,
safer candidate try!"</i></p>
<p><i>But the prophecy...</i></p>
<p><i>"You don't really know that there's a prophecy. It was
originally a wild guess on your part, or to be more precise, a wild
joke, and McGonagall could have been reacting</i> only <i>to the
part about the Dark Lord still being alive. You have essentially no
idea of what the prophecy says or even if there</i> is <i>one.
You're just speculating, or to put it more exactly,</i> wishing
<i>that you have some ready-made heroic role that is your personal
property."</i></p>
<p><i>But even if there is no prophecy, I'm the one who defeated
him last time.</i></p>
<p><i>"That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously
believe that a one-year-old child had an inherent propensity to
defeat Dark Lords which has been maintained ten years later. None
of this is your real reason and</i> you know it!"</p>
<p>The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly
have said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it
and found some more socially palatable arguments to the same
conclusion -</p>
<p><i>"You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet
lived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely
to take up your wand if you lay it down."</i></p>
<p><i>Well... yeah, frankly. I don't usually come out and say it
like that, but yeah. No point in softening it, you can read my mind
anyway.</i></p>
<p><i>"To the extent you really believe that... you must equally
believe that you could be the most terrible Dark Lord the world has
ever known."</i></p>
<p><i>Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear
things apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again. If
I have the potential to accomplish good on a massive scale, I must
also have the potential to accomplish still greater evil... But I
won't do that.</i></p>
<p><i>"Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven?
What is the real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and</i> be
happier <i>there? What is your true fear?"</i></p>
<p><i>I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I...
fail...</i></p>
<p><i>"What happens if you fail?"</i></p>
<p><i>Something terrible...</i></p>
<p><i>"What happens if you fail?"</i></p>
<p><i>I don't know!</i></p>
<p><i>"Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you
fail?"</i></p>
<p><i>I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!</i></p>
<p>There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's
mind.</p>
<p><i>"You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in some
quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly</i> what <i>you
aren't thinking - you</i> know <i>that by far the simplest
explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just the fear
of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people
who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of
flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies..."</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> Harry thought desperately, <i>no, it's something
more, it comes from somewhere else, I know there's something out
there to be afraid of, some disaster I have to stop...</i></p>
<p><i>"How could you possibly know about something like
that?"</i></p>
<p>Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: <i>NO, AND
THAT'S FINAL!</i></p>
<p>Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:</p>
<p><i>"So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the
alternative, to you, is certain failure, and that failure means the
loss of everything. You believe that in your heart of hearts. You
know all the reasons for doubting this belief, and they have failed
to move you."</i></p>
<p><i>Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw</i> strengthens <i>the
coldness, that doesn't mean the coldness will</i> win <i>in the
end.</i></p>
<p><i>"This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don't be so sure
that there will be other choices beyond this one. There is no
road-sign set, to mark the place of your</i> last <i>chance to turn
back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse others? It may
be that your fate is already sealed, even by doing this one
thing."</i></p>
<p><i>But that is not certain.</i></p>
<p><i>"That</i> you <i>do not</i> know <i>it for a certainty may
reflect only</i> your <i>own ignorance."</i></p>
<p><i>But still it is not certain.</i></p>
<p>The Hat sighed a terrible sad sigh.</p>
<p><i>"And so before too long you will become another memory, to be
felt and never known, in the next warning that I give..."</i></p>
<p><i>If that's how it seems to you, then why aren't you just</i>
putting <i>me where you want me to go?</i></p>
<p>The Hat's thought was laced with sorrow. <i>"I can only put you
where you belong. And only your own decisions can change where you
belong."</i></p>
<p><i>Then this is done. Send me to Ravenclaw where I belong, with
the others of my own kind.</i></p>
<p><i>"I don't suppose you would consider Gryffindor? It's the most
prestigious House - people probably expect it of you, even -
they'll be a little disappointed if you don't go - and your new
friends the Weasley twins are there -"</i></p>
<p>Harry giggled, or felt the impulse to do so; it came out as
purely mental laughter, an odd sensation. Apparently there were
safeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by
accident, while you were under the Hat talking about things you
would never tell another soul for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sad
clothy sound.</p>
<p>(And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at
first as the background whispers increased, and then deepened as
the whispers gave up and died away, falling finally into an utter
silence that no one dared disturb with a single word, as Harry
stayed under the Hat for long, long minutes, longer than all the
previous first-years put together, longer than anyone in living
memory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly;
small metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as
he idly compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy
silver wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a
white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos
had somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the Hat was about
to, to demand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to
accomodate Harry Potter or something, and <i>Dumbledore would make
her do it</i>...)</p>
<p>Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away.
Harry felt sad too for some reason. No, not Gryffindor.</p>
<p><i>Professor McGonagall said that if 'the one who did the
Sorting' tried to push me into Gryffindor, I was to remind you that
she might well be Headmistress someday, at which point she would
have the authority to set you on fire.</i></p>
<p><i>"Tell her I called her an impudent youngster and told her to
get off my lawn."</i></p>
<p><i>I shall. So was this your strangest conversation
ever?</i></p>
<p><i>"Not even close."</i> The Hat's telepathic voice grew heavy.
<i>"Well, I gave you every possible chance to make another
decision. Now it is time for you to go where you belong, with the
others of your own kind."</i></p>
<p>There was a pause that stretched.</p>
<p><i>What are you waiting for?</i></p>
<p><i>"I was hoping for a moment of horrified realisation,
actually. Self-awareness does seem to enhance my sense of
humor."</i></p>
<p><i>Huh?</i> Harry cast back his thoughts, trying to figure out
what the Hat could possibly be talking about - and then, suddenly,
he realised. He couldn't believe he'd managed to overlook it up
until this point.</p>
<p><i>You mean my horrified realisation that you're going to cease
to be conscious once you finish Sorting me -</i></p>
<p>Somehow, in some fashion Harry entirely failed to understand, he
got a nonverbal impression of a hat banging its head against the
wall. <i>"I give up. You're too slow on the uptake for this to be
funny. So blinded by your own assumptions that you might as well be
a rock. I suppose I'll just have to say it outright."</i></p>
<p><i>Too s-s-slow -</i></p>
<p><i>"Oh, and you entirely forgot to demand the secrets of the
lost magic that created me. And they were such wonderful, important
secrets, too."</i></p>
<p><i>You sly little BASTARD -</i></p>
<p><i>"You deserved it, and this as well."</i></p>
<p>Harry saw it coming just as it was already too late.</p>
<p>The frightened silence of the hall was broken by a single
word.</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>Some students screamed, the pent-up tension was so great. People
startled hard enough to fall off their benches. Hagrid gasped in
horror, McGonagall staggered at the podium, and Snape dropped the
remains of his heavy silver goblet directly onto his groin.</p>
<p>Harry sat there frozen, his life in ruins, feeling the absolute
fool, and wishing wretchedly that he had made any other choices for
any other reasons but the ones he had. That he had done something,
<i>anything</i> differently before it had been too late to turn
back.</p>
<p>As the first moment of shock was wearing off and people began to
react to the news, the Sorting Hat spoke again:</p>
<p>"Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"</p>

<p>Dumbledore peered over his desk at young Harry, twinkling in a
kindly sort of way. The boy had come to him with a terribly intense
look on his childish face - Dumbledore hoped that whatever this
matter was, it wasn't <i>too</i> serious. Harry was far too young
for his life trials to be starting already. "What was it you wished
to speak to me about, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres leaned forward in his chair,
smiling grimly. "Headmaster, I got a sharp pain in my scar during
the Sorting Feast. Considering how and where I got this scar, it
didn't seem like the sort of thing I should just ignore. I thought
at first it was because of Professor Snape, but I followed the
Baconian experimental method which is to find the conditions for
both the presence and the absence of the phenomenon, and I've
determined that my scar hurts if and only if I'm facing the back of
Professor Quirrell's head, whatever's under his turban. While it

conversation stopped.</p>
<p>A silence broken by a horrible buzzing noise that modulated and
changed in hideous mockery of musical melody.</p>
<p>Minerva's head jerked around, shocked, and identified the
buzzing noise as coming from the Gryffindor direction, where They
were <i>standing on top of the table</i> blowing into some kind of
tiny devices held against Their lips. Her hand started to drop to
her wand, to <i>Silencio</i> the lot of Them, but another sound
stopped her.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was chuckling.</p>
<p>Minerva's eyes went back to Harry Potter, who had only just
started to step out of line before he'd stumbled and halted.</p>
<p>Then the young boy began to walk again, moving his legs in odd
sweeping motions, and waving his arms back and forth and snapping
his fingers, in synchrony with Their music.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>To the tune of
"Ghostbusters"</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(As performed on the kazoo by Fred
and George Weasley,<br />
and sung by Lee Jordan.)</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>There's a Dark Lord
near?<br /></i><i>Got no need to fear<br />
Who you gonna call?</i></p>
<p>"HARRY POTTER!" shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins
performed a triumphant chorus.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>With a Killing Curse?<br />
Well it could be worse.<br />
Who you gonna call?</i></p>
<p>"HARRY POTTER!" There were a lot more voices shouting it this
time.</p>
<p>The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now
accompanied by some of the older Muggleborns, who had produced
their own tiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware
no doubt. As their music reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter
shouted:</p>
<p><i>I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!</i></p>
<p>There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table,
and more students produced their own antimusical instruments. The
hideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awful
crescendo:</p>
<p><i>I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!</i></p>
<p>Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look
but with all too good a notion of what she would see.</p>
<p>Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with
curiosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking
severe, and Quirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement.
Directly to her left, Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her
right, Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so
hard that the thick silver was slowly deforming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Dark robes and a mask?<br />
Impossible task?<br />
Who you gonna call?<br />
HARRY POTTER!</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Giant Fire-Ape?<br />
Old bat in a cape?<br />
Who you gonna call?<br />
HARRY POTTER!</i></p>
<p>Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with
Them about that last verse, if They thought she was powerless
because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points
to take away. If They didn't care about detentions then she would
find something else.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape's
direction, <i>surely</i> he realised the Potter boy must have no
idea who that was talking about -</p>
<p>Snape's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant
indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking
in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his
hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet...</p>
<p>And Harry walked forwards, sweeping his arms and legs through
the motions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face.
It was a great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The
least he could do was play along and not ruin it all.</p>
<p>Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and
sort of awful at the same time.</p>
<p>They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year
old. A job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark
Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard,
if they knew that?</p>
<p>But the Dark Lord's power <i>had</i> been broken once.</p>
<p>And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a
prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of
what any darn prophecy said.</p>
<p>All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry
couldn't stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many
other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up
to his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind <i>how</i>
he'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long
it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And
then go on to <i>exceed</i> those expectations, so that people
wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of
him.</p>
<p>And he shouted out the lie that he'd invented because it scanned
well and the song called for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>I ain't afraid of Dark
Lords!<br />
I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!</i></p>
<p>Harry took his last steps toward the Sorting Hat as the music
ended. He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor
table, and then turned and swept another bow to the other side of
the hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die
away...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>OMAKE FILES #3: Alternate Endings
of 'Self-Awareness'</u></p>
<p>The offer to tell the whole plot to anyone who guessed what 'has
never happened before' spurred a <i>lot</i> of interesting
attempts. The first omake below is taken directly from my personal
favorite answer, by Meteoricshipyards. The second is based on
Kazuma's suggestion for what "has never happened before", the third
on a combination of yoyoente and dougal74, the fourth on wolf550e's
review of chapter 10. The one that starts with 'K', and the one
just above that, are from DarkHeart81. The others are my own.
Anyone who wants to pick up one of my own ideas and run with them,
particularly the last one, is welcome to do so. And before I get
100 indignant complaints, yes, I am well aware that the legislative
body of the UK is the House of Commons in Parliament.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>...In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was
genuinely <i>conscious</i> in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
<i>Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...</i></p>
<p>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and <i>carefully</i> placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.</p>
<p>Thinking, just as hard as he could: <i>Don't Sort me yet! I have
questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you
Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about
his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to the
Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is that
why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?</i></p>
<p>And the Sorting Hat answered, "<i>No. Yes. No. No. Yes and no,
next time don't ask double questions. No.</i>" and out loud,
"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm allergic to your hair shampoo -"</i></p>
<p>And then the Sorting Hat sneezed, with a mighty "A-CHOO!" that
echoed around the Great Hall.</p>
<p>"Well!" Dumbledore cried jovially. "It seems Harry Potter has
been sorted into the new House of Achoo! McGonagall, you can serve
as the Head of House Achoo. You'd better hurry up on making
arrangements for Achoo's curriculum and classes, tomorrow is the
first day!"</p>
<p>"But, but, but," stammered McGonagall, her mind in nearly
complete disarray, "who will be Head of House Gryffindor?" It was
all she could think of, she <i>had</i> to stop this somehow...</p>
<p>Dumbledore put a finger to his cheek, looking thoughtful.
"Snape."</p>
<p>Snape's screech of protest nearly drowned out McGonagall's,
"Then who will be Head of <i>Slytherin?</i>"</p>
<p>"Hagrid."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Don't Sort me yet! I have questions I need to ask you! Have I
ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a
child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why
I got the brother wand to the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost
bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those
are the most important questions, but if you've got another moment
can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics
that created you?</i></p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p><i>Hello? Do I need to repeat the questions?</i></p>
<p>The Sorting Hat screamed, an awful high-pitched sound that
echoed through the Great Hall and caused most of the students to
clap their hands over their ears. With a desperate yowl, it leapt
off Harry Potter's head and bounded across the floor, pushing
itself along with its brim, and made it halfway to the Head Table
before it exploded.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>Seeing the look of horror on Harry Potter's face, Fred Weasley
thought faster than he ever had in his life. In a single motion he
whipped out his wand, whispered <i>"Silencio!"</i> and then
"<i>Changemyvoiceio!"</i> and finally "<i>Ventriliquo!</i>"</p>
<p>"Just kidding!" said Fred Weasley. "GRYFFINDOR!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p><i>"Ordinarily I would refer such questions to the Headmaster,
who could ask me in turn, if he wished. But some of the information
you've asked for is not only beyond your own user level, but beyond
the Headmaster's."</i></p>
<p><i>How can I raise my user level?</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm afraid I am not allowed to answer that question at your
current user level."</i></p>
<p><i>What options</i> are <i>available at my user level?</i></p>
<p>After that it didn't take long -</p>
<p>"ROOT!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p><i>"I've had to tell students before that they were mothers - it
would break your heart to know what I saw in their minds - but this
is the first time I've ever had to tell someone they were a
father."</i></p>
<p><i>WHAT?</i></p>
<p><i>"Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby."</i></p>
<p><i>WHAAAAAAAT?</i></p>
<p><i>"To repeat: Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby."</i></p>
<p><i>But we're only eleven -</i></p>
<p><i>"Actually, Draco is secretly thirteen years old."</i></p>
<p><i>B-b-but men can't get pregnant -</i></p>
<p><i>"And a girl under those clothes."</i></p>
<p><i>BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD SEX, YOU IDIOT!</i></p>
<p><i>"SHE OBLIVIATED YOU AFTER THE RAPE, MORON!"</i></p>
<p>Harry Potter fainted. His unconscious body fell off the stool
with a dull thud.</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!" called out the Hat from where it lay on top of his
head. That had been even funnier than its first idea.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"ELF!"</p>
<p>Huh? Harry remembered Draco mentioning a 'House Elf', but what
was that exactly?</p>
<p>Judging by the appalled looks dawning on the faces around him,
it wasn't anything good -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"PANCAKES!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"REPRESENTATIVES!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p><i>"I've never Sorted someone who was a reincarnation of Godric
Gryffindor AND Salazar Slytherin AND Naruto."</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"ATREIDES!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Fooled you again! HUFFLEPUFF! SLYTHERIN! HUFFLEPUFF!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"PICKLED STEWBERRIES!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"KHAAANNNN!"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly; small
metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as he idly
compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy silver
wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a
white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos
had infected the Sorting Hat itself.</p>
<p>Scenario after scenario played out through Minerva's head, each
worse than the last. The Hat would say that Harry was too evenly
balanced between Houses to Sort, and decide that he belonged to all
of them. The Hat would proclaim that Harry's mind was too strange
to be Sorted. The Hat would demand that Harry be expelled from
Hogwarts. The Hat had gone into a coma. The Hat would insist that a
whole new House of Doom be created just to accomodate Harry Potter,
and <i>Dumbledore would make her do it...</i></p>
<p>Minerva remembered what Harry had told her in that disastrous
trip to Diagon Alley, about the... planning fallacy, she thought it
had been... and how people were usually too optimistic, even when
they thought they were being pessimistic. It was the sort of
information that preyed on your mind, dwelling in it and spinning
off nightmares...</p>
<p>But what was the <i>worst</i> that could happen?</p>
<p>Well... in the <i>worst-case scenario,</i> the Hat would assign
Harry to a whole new House. Dumbledore would insist that she do it
- create a whole new House just for him - and she'd have to
rearrange all the class schedules on the first day of term. And
Dumbledore would remove her as Head of House Gryffindor, and give
her beloved House over to... Professor Binns, the History ghost;
and she would be assigned as Head of Harry's House of Doom; and she
would futilely try to give the child orders, deducting point after
point without effect, while disaster after disaster was blamed on
her.</p>
<p>Was that the worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>Minerva honestly didn't see how it could be any worse than
that.</p>
<p>And even in the very worst case - no matter <i>what</i> happened
with Harry - it would all be over in seven years.</p>
<p>Minerva felt her knuckles slowly relax their white-knuckled grip
on the podium. Harry had been right, there was a kind of comfort in
staring directly into the furthest depths of the darkness, knowing
that you had confronted your worst fears and were now prepared.</p>
<p>The frightened silence was broken by a single word.</p>
<p>"Headmaster!" called the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>At the Head Table, Dumbledore rose, his face puzzled. "Yes?" he
addressed the Hat. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't talking to you," said the Hat. "I was Sorting Harry
Potter into the place in Hogwarts where he most belongs, namely the
Headmaster's office -"</p>

<p>"Turpin, Lisa!"</p>
<p>Whisper whisper whisper harry potter whisper whisper slytherin
whisper whisper no seriously what the hell whisper whisper</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>Harry joined in the applause greeting the young girl walking
shyly towards the Ravenclaw table, her robes' trim now changed to
dark blue. Lisa Turpin appeared torn between her impulse to sit
down as far away from Harry Potter as possible, and her impulse to
run over, forcibly insert herself at his side and start tearing
answers out of him.</p>
<p>Being at the center of an extraordinary and curious event, and
then being Sorted into House Ravenclaw, was closely akin to being
dipped in barbecue sauce and flung into a pit of starving
kittens.</p>
<p>"I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about it," whispered
Harry for the umpteenth time.</p>
<p>"Yes, really."</p>
<p>"No, I really did promise the Sorting Hat not to talk about
it."</p>
<p>"Fine, I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about <i>most</i>
of it and the rest is <i>private</i> just like <i>yours was</i> so
<i>stop asking.</i>"</p>
<p>"You want to know what happened? Fine! Here's part of what
happened! I told the Hat that Professor McGonagall threatened to
set it on fire and it told me to tell Professor McGonagall that she
was an impudent youngster and she should get off its lawn!"</p>
<p>"If you're not going to believe what I say then <i>why are you
even asking?</i>"</p>
<p>"No, I don't know how I defeated the Dark Lord either! You tell
me if you figure it out!"</p>
<p>"<i>Silence!</i>" shouted Professor McGonagall at the podium of
the Head Table. "<i>No talking until the Sorting Ceremony
finishes!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a brief dip in the volume, as everyone waited to see
if she was going to make any specific and credible threats, and
then the whispers started up again.</p>
<p>Then the silver-bearded ancient stood up from his great golden
chair, smiling cheerfully.</p>
<p>Instant silence. Someone frantically elbowed Harry as he tried
to continue a whisper, and Harry cut himself off in
mid-sentence.</p>
<p>The cheerful-looking old man sat down again.</p>
<p><i>Note to self: Do not mess with Dumbledore.</i></p>
<p>Harry was still trying to process everything that had happened
during the Incident with the Sorting Hat. Not the least of which
was what had happened the instant Harry had lifted the Hat off his
head; in that moment, he'd heard a tiny whisper as though from
nowhere, something that sounded oddly like English and a hiss at
the same time, something that had said, "<i>Ssalutations from
Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek my ssecretss, sspeak
to my ssnake."</i></p>
<p>Harry was sorta guessing that wasn't supposed to be part of the
official Sorting process. And that it was a bit of extra magic set
down by Salazar Slytherin during the making of the Hat. And that
the Hat itself didn't know about it. And that it was triggered when
the Hat said "SLYTHERIN", plus or minus some other conditions. And
that a Ravenclaw like himself <i>really, really wasn't supposed to
have heard it</i>. And that if he could find some reliable way of
swearing Draco to secrecy so he could ask him about it, that would
be an excellent time to have some Comed-Tea handy.</p>
<p><i>Boy, you resolve not to go down the path of a Dark Lord and
the universe starts messing with you the instant the Hat comes off
your head. Some days it just doesn't pay to fight destiny. Maybe
I'll wait until tomorrow to start on my resolution to not be a Dark
Lord.</i></p>
<p>"GRYFFINDOR!"</p>
<p>Ron Weasley got a <i>lot</i> of applause, and not just from the
Gryffindors. Apparently the Weasley family was widely liked around
here. Harry, after a moment, smiled and started applauding along
with the others.</p>
<p>Then again, there was no time like today to turn back from the
Dark Side.</p>
<p>Stuff destiny and stuff the universe. He'd show that Hat.</p>
<p>"Zabini, Blaise!"</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!" shouted the hat.</p>
<p>Harry applauded Zabini too, ignoring the odd looks he was
getting from everyone including Zabini.</p>
<p>No other name was called out after that, and Harry realised that
"Zabini, Blaise" did sound close to the end of the alphabet. Great,
so now he'd <i>only</i> applauded Zabini... Oh well.</p>
<p>Dumbledore got up again and began heading towards the podium.
Apparently they were about to be treated to a speech -</p>
<p>And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a <i>brilliant</i>
experimental test.</p>
<p>Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard
alive, right?</p>
<p>Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, "Comed-Tea".</p>
<p>For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say
something <i>so</i> ridiculous during his speech that even in
Harry's state of mental preparedness, he would <i>still</i> choke.
Like, all the Hogwarts students had to not wear any clothes for the
whole school year, or everyone was going to be transformed into
cats.</p>
<p>But then if <i>anyone in the world</i> could resist the power of
the Comed-Tea, it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the
Comed-Tea was literally <i>invincible.</i></p>
<p>Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting
to do this a bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise.
A few heads turned to look at him, but soon turned back as -</p>
<p>"Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!" said Dumbledore,
beaming at the students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing
could have pleased him more than to see them all there.</p>
<p>Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can
again. He would swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to
choke no matter <i>what</i> Dumbledore said -</p>
<p>"Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words.
And here they are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thank
you!"</p>
<p>Everyone clapped and cheered, and Dumbledore sat down again.</p>
<p>Harry sat frozen as pop trickled out of the corners of his
mouth. He had, at least, managed to choke <i>quietly</i>.</p>
<p>He really really <i>really</i> shouldn't have done that. Amazing
how much <i>more obvious</i> that became <i>one second</i> after it
was <i>too late</i>.</p>
<p>In retrospect he probably should have noticed something wrong
when he was thinking about everyone being turned into cats... or
even before then, remembered his mental note not to mess with
Dumbledore... or his newfound resolution to be more considerate of
others... or maybe if he'd had <i>one single scrap</i> of <i>common
sense</i>...</p>
<p>It was hopeless. He was corrupt to the core. Hail the Dark Lord
Harry. You couldn't fight fate.</p>
<p>Someone was asking Harry if he was all right. (Others were
starting to serve themselves food, which had magically appeared on
the table, whatever.)</p>
<p>"I'm all right," Harry said. "Excuse me. Um. Was that a...
<i>normal</i> speech for the Headmaster? You all... didn't seem...
very surprised..."</p>
<p>"Oh, Dumbledore's insane, of course," said an older-looking
Ravenclaw sitting next to him who had introduced himself with some
name Harry didn't even begin to remember. "Lots of fun, incredibly
powerful wizard, but completely bonkers." He paused. "At some later
point I'd also like to ask why green fluid came out of your lips
and then disappeared, though I expect you promised the Sorting Hat
not to talk about that either."</p>
<p>With a great effort, Harry stopped himself from glancing down at
the incriminating can of Comed-Tea in his hand.</p>
<p>After all, the Comed-Tea hadn't just arbitrarily
<i>materialised</i> a Quibbler headline about him and Draco. Draco
had explained it in a way that made it seem like it had all
happened... naturally? As if it had <i>altered history to
fit?</i></p>
<p>Harry was mentally imagining himself banging his forehead
against the table. <i>Wham, wham, wham</i> went his head within his
mind.</p>
<p>Another student lowered her voice to a whisper. "I hear that
Dumbledore is secretly a genius mastermind controlling lots of
stuff and he uses the insanity as a cover so that no one will
suspect him."</p>
<p>"I've heard that too," whispered a third student, and there were
furtive nods from around the table.</p>
<p>This couldn't help but catch Harry's attention.</p>
<p>"I see," whispered Harry, lowering his own voice. "So everyone
knows that Dumbledore is secretly a mastermind."</p>
<p>Most of the students nodded. One or two looked suddenly
thoughtful, including the older student sitting next to Harry.</p>
<p><i>Are you sure this is the Ravenclaw table?</i> Harry managed
not to ask out loud.</p>
<p>"Brilliant!" Harry whispered. "If everyone knows, no one will
suspect it's a secret!"</p>
<p>"Exactly," whispered a student, and then he frowned. "Wait, that
doesn't sound quite right -"</p>
<p><i>Note to self: The 75th percentile of Hogwarts students a.k.a.
Ravenclaw House is not the world's most exclusive program for
gifted children.</i></p>
<p>But at least he'd learned an important fact today. The Comed-Tea
was omnipotent. And <i>that</i> meant...</p>
<p>Harry blinked in surprise as his mind finally made the obvious
connection.</p>
<p>...<i>that</i> meant that as soon as he learned a spell to
temporarily alter his own sense of humor, he could make
<i>anything</i> happen, by making it so that he would <i>only</i>
find that <i>one thing</i> surprising enough to do a spit-take, and
then drinking a can of Comed-Tea.</p>
<p><i>Well that was a short little journey to godhood. Even I
expected this to take longer than my first day of school.</i></p>
<p>Come to think of it, he had also completely wrecked Hogwarts
within ten minutes flat of getting Sorted.</p>
<p>Harry did feel a certain amount of regret about this - Merlin
knew what an insane Headmaster was going to do to his next seven
years of schooling - but he couldn't <i>help</i> feeling a twinge
of pride, too.</p>
<p>Tomorrow. No later than tomorrow at the very latest he was going
to stop walking down the path that led to Dark Lord Harry. A
prospect which was sounding scarier by the minute.</p>
<p>And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind
was already visualising the minions' uniforms.</p>
<p>"Eat," the older student sitting next to him growled, and jabbed
Harry in the ribs. "Don't think. Eat."</p>
<p>Harry automatically started loading up his plate with whatever
was in front of him, blue sausages with tiny glowing bits,
whatever.</p>
<p>"What were you thinking about, the Sorting -" began to say Padma
Patil, one of the other first-year Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>"No pestering during mealtimes!" chorused at least three people.
"House Rule!" added another. "Otherwise we'd all starve around
here."</p>
<p>Harry was finding himself really, really hoping that his clever
new idea didn't <i>actually</i> work. And that the Comed-Tea worked
some other way and didn't <i>actually</i> have the omnipotent power
to alter reality. It wasn't that he didn't <i>want</i> to be
omnipotent. It was that he just couldn't bear the thought of living
in a universe that really worked like that. There was something
<i>undignified</i> about ascending through the clever use of fizzy
drinks.</p>
<p>But he <i>was</i> going to test it experimentally.</p>
<p>"You know," said the older student next to him in a quite
pleasant tone, "we have a system for forcing people like you to
eat, would you like to find out what it is?"</p>
<p>Harry gave up and started eating his blue sausage. It was quite
good, especially the glowing bits.</p>
<p>Dinner passed with surprising rapidity. Harry tried to sample at
least a little of all the weird new foods he saw. His curiosity
couldn't stand the thought of <i>not knowing</i> how something
tasted. Thank goodness this wasn't a restaurant where you had to
order only one thing and you never found out what all the other
things on the menu tasted like. Harry <i>hated</i> that, it was
like a torture chamber for anyone with a spark of curiosity:
<i>Find out about only one of the mysteries on this list, ha ha
ha!</i></p>
<p>Then it was time for dessert, which Harry had completely
forgotten to leave room for. He gave up after sampling a small bit
of treacle tart. Surely all these things would pass around at least
once again over the course of the school year.</p>
<p>So what was on his to-do list, besides the ordinary school
things?</p>
<p><i>To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms so you can test the
Comed-Tea and see whether you actually did figure out a path to
omnipotence. Actually, just research every kind of mind magic you
can find. Mind is the foundation of our power as humans, any kind
of magic that affects it is the most important sort of magic there
is.</i></p>
<p><i>To-do 2. Actually this is To-do 1 and the other is To-do 2.
Go through the bookshelves of the Hogwarts and Ravenclaw libraries,
familiarising yourself with the system and making sure you've at
least read all the book titles. Second pass: read all tables of
contents. Coordinate with Hermione who has a much better memory
than you. Find out if there's an interlibrary loan system at
Hogwarts and see if the two of you, especially Hermione, can visit
those libraries too. If other Houses have private libraries, figure
out how to access legally or sneak in.</i></p>
<p><i>Option 3a: Swear Hermione to secrecy and try to start
researching 'From Slytherin to Slytherin: if you would seek my
secrets, speak to my snake.' Problem: This sounds highly
confidential and it could take quite a while to randomly run across
a book containing a hint.</i></p>
<p><i>To-do 0: Check out what sort of
information-search-and-retrieval spells exist, if any. Library
magic isn't as ultimately important as mind magic but it has a much
higher priority.</i></p>
<p><i>Option 3b: Look for a spell to magically bind Draco Malfoy to
secrecy, or magically verify the sincerity of Draco's promise to
keep a secret (Veritaserum?), and then ask</i> him <i>about
Slytherin's message...</i></p>
<p>Actually... Harry had a pretty bad feeling about option 3b.</p>
<p>Now that Harry thought about it, he didn't feel all that great
about option 3a, either.</p>
<p>Harry's thoughts flashed back to possibly the worst moment of
his life to date, those long seconds of blood-freezing horror
beneath the Hat, when he thought he'd already failed. He'd wished
then to fall back just a few minutes in time and change something,
anything before it was too late...</p>
<p>And then it had turned out to not be too late after all.</p>
<p>Wish granted.</p>
<p>You couldn't change history. But you could get it right to start
with. Do something differently the <i>first</i> time around.</p>
<p>This whole business with seeking Slytherin's secrets... seemed
an awful lot like the sort of thing where, years later, you would
look back and say, 'And <i>that</i> was where it all started going
wrong.'</p>
<p>And he would wish desperately for the ability to fall back
through time and make a different choice...</p>
<p>Wish granted. Now what?</p>
<p>Harry slowly smiled.</p>
<p>It was a rather <i>counterintuitive</i> thought... but...</p>
<p>But he <i>could,</i> there was no rule saying he couldn't, he
<i>could</i> just pretend he'd never heard that little whisper. Let
the universe go on in exactly the same way it would have if that
one critical moment had never occurred. Twenty years later, that
was what he would desperately wish had happened twenty years ago,
and twenty years before twenty years later happened to be right
now. Altering the distant past was easy, you just had to think of
it at the right time.</p>
<p>Or... this was even <i>more</i> counterintuitive... he could
even inform, oh, say, <i>Professor McGonagall,</i> instead of Draco
<i>or</i> Hermione. And she could get a few good people together
and get that little extra spell taken off the Hat.</p>
<p>Why, yes. That sounded like a <i>remarkably</i> good idea once
Harry had actually <i>thought</i> of it.</p>
<p>So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and
Option 3d just hadn't occurred to him.</p>
<p>Harry awarded himself +1 point on his anti-Dark-Lord-Harry
program.</p>
<p>It had been an awfully cruel prank the Hat had played on him,
but you couldn't argue with the results on consequentialist
grounds. It certainly did give him a better idea of the victim's
perspective, though.</p>
<p><i>To-do 4: Apologise to Neville Longbottom.</i></p>
<p>Okay, he was on a roll here, now he just had to keep it up.
<i>In every day, in every way, I'm getting Lighter and
Lighter...</i></p>
<p>People around Harry had also mostly stopped eating at this
point, and the dessert serving dishes began to vanish, and the used
plates.</p>
<p>When all the plates were gone, Dumbledore once again stood up
from his seat.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but feel the urge to drink another
Comed-Tea.</p>
<p><i>You've GOT to be kidding,</i> Harry thought at that piece of
himself.</p>
<p>But the experiment didn't count if it wasn't replicated, did it?
And the damage was already done, wasn't it? Didn't he want to see
what would happen <i>this</i> time? Wasn't he <i>curious?</i> What
if he got a different result?</p>
<p><i>Hey, I bet you're the same part of my brain that pushed
through the prank on Neville Longbottom.</i></p>
<p>Er, maybe?</p>
<p><i>And is it not</i> overwhelmingly <i>obvious that if I do this
I shall regret it one second after it is too late?</i></p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p><i>Yeah. So, NO.</i></p>
<p>"Ahem," said Dumbledore from the podium, stroking his long
silver beard. "Just a few more words now that we are all fed and
watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you."</p>
<p>"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is
forbidden to all pupils. That is why it is called the Forbidden
Forest. If it were permitted it would be called the Permitted
Forest."</p>
<p>Straightforward. <i>Note to self: Forbidden Forest is
forbidden.</i></p>
<p>"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind
you all that no magic should be used between classes in the
corridors. Alas, we all know that what <i>should be</i>, and what
<i>is</i>, are two different things. Thank you for keeping this in
mind."</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact
Madam Hooch. Anyone interested in reformulating the entire game of
Quidditch should contact Harry Potter."</p>
<p>Harry inhaled his own saliva and went into a coughing fit just
as all eyes turned towards him. How the <i>hell!</i> He hadn't met
Dumbledore's eyes at any point... he didn't <i>think.</i> He
certainly hadn't been thinking about Quidditch at the time! He
hadn't talked to anyone but Ron Weasley and he didn't <i>think</i>
Ron would have told anyone else... or had Ron run off to a
professor to complain? <i>How</i> on <i>Earth...</i></p>
<p>"Additionally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor
corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who
does not wish to die a very painful death. It is guarded by an
elaborate series of dangerous and potentially lethal traps, and you
cannot possibly get past all of them, especially if you are only in
your first year."</p>
<p>Harry was numb at this point.</p>
<p>"And finally, I extend my greatest thanks to Quirinus Quirrell
for heroically agreeing to undertake the position of Defence
Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts." Dumbledore's gaze
moved searchingly across the students. "I hope all students will
extend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and <i>tolerance</i>
which is due his extraordinary service to you and this school, and
that you <i>will not pester us</i> with any <i>niggling
complaints</i> about him, unless <i>you</i> want to try doing his
job."</p>
<p>What was <i>that</i> about?</p>
<p>"I now yield the floor to our new faculty member Professor
Quirrell, who would like to say a few words."</p>
<p>The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the
Leaky Cauldron slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing
fearfully around in all directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the
back of his head, and it looked like Professor Quirrell might
already be going bald, despite his seeming youth.</p>
<p>"Wonder what's wrong with <i>him,</i>" whispered the
older-looking student sitting next to Harry. Similar hushed
comments were being exchanged elsewhere along the table.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood
there, blinking. "Ah..." he said. "Ah..." Then his courage seemed
to fail him utterly, and he stood there in silence, occasionally
twitching.</p>
<p>"Oh, great," whispered the older student, "looks like another
<i>long</i> year in Defence class -"</p>
<p>"Salutations, my young apprentices," Professor Quirrell said in
a dry, confident tone. "We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a
certain <i>misfortune</i> in its selections for this position, and
no doubt many of you are already wondering what doom shall befall
me this year. I assure you, that doom is not to be my
incompetence." He smiled thinly. "Believe it or not, I have long
wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against
the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. The first to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin
himself, and as late as the fourteenth century it was traditional
for the greatest fighting wizards of every persuasion to try their
hands at teaching here. Past Professors of Defence have included
not just the legendary wandering hero Harold Shea but also the
quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see some of you are still
shuddering at the sound of her name even though she's been dead for
six hundred years. That must have been an interesting time to
attend Hogwarts, don't you think?"</p>
<p>Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surge
of emotion that had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begun
speaking. The precise tones reminded him very much of a lecturer at
Oxford, and it was starting to hit home that Harry wasn't going to
see his home or his Mum or his Dad until Christmas.</p>
<p>"You are accustomed to the Defence position being filled by
incompetents, scoundrels, and the unlucky. To anyone with a sense
of history, it bears another reputation entirely. Not everyone who
teaches here has been the best, but the best have all taught at
Hogwarts. In such august company, and after so much time
anticipating this day, I would be ashamed to set myself any
standard lower than perfection. And so I do intend that every one
of you will always remember this year as the <i>best</i> Defence
class that you have ever had. What you learn this year will forever
serve as your firm foundation in the arts of Defence, no matter who
your teachers before and after."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression grew serious. "We have a
<i>great</i> deal of lost ground to make up and not much time to
cover it. Therefore I intend to depart from Hogwarts teaching
conventions in a number of respects, as well as introducing some
optional after-school activities." He paused. "If that is not
sufficient, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you. You are my
long-awaited students, and you <i>will</i> do your <i>very</i> best
in my long-awaited Defence class. I would add some sort of dreadful
threat, like 'Otherwise you will suffer horribly', but that would
be so cliched, don't you think? I pride myself on being more
imaginative than that. Thank you."</p>
<p>Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from
Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly
found himself facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a
convulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if
he was about to collapse in on himself and implode.</p>
<p>"He seems a little odd," whispered Harry.</p>
<p>"Meh," said the older-looking student. "You ain't seen
nothin'."</p>
<p>Dumbledore resumed the podium.</p>
<p>"And now," said Dumbledore, "before we go to bed, let us sing
the school song! Everyone pick their favourite tune and favourite
words, and off we go!"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="13">Chapter 13</h2><h3>Asking the Wrong
Questions</h3>
<p>Elen sila J. K. Rowling omentielvo.</p>
<p>EDIT: Don't panic. I solemnly swear that there is a logical,
foreshadowed, canon-compliant explanation for everything which
happens in this chapter. It's a puzzle, you're supposed to try to
solve it, and if not, just read the next chapter.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever
heard."</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As soon as Harry opened his eyes in the Ravenclaw first-year
boys' dormitory, on the morning of his first full day at Hogwarts,
he knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>It was quiet.</p>
<p><i>Too</i> quiet.</p>
<p>Oh, right... There was a Quietus Charm on his bed's headboard,
controlled by a small slider bar, which was the only reason it was
ever possible for anyone to go to sleep in Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Harry sat up and looked around, expecting to see others rising
for the day -</p>
<p>The dorm, empty.</p>
<p>The beds, rumpled and unmade.</p>
<p>The sun, coming in at a rather high angle.</p>
<p>His Quieter turned all the way up to maximum.</p>
<p>And his mechanical alarm clock was still running, but the alarm
was turned off.</p>
<p>He'd been allowed to sleep until 9:52 AM, apparently. Despite
his best efforts to synchronize his 26-hour sleep cycle to his
arrival at Hogwarts, he hadn't gotten to sleep last night until
around 1AM. He'd been planning to wake up at 7:00AM with the other
students, he could stand being a little sleep-deprived his first
day so long as he got some sort of magical fix before tomorrow. But
now he'd missed breakfast. And his very first class at Hogwarts, in
Herbology, had started one hour and twenty-two minutes ago.</p>
<p>The anger was slowly, slowly wakening in him. Oh, what a nice
little prank. Turn off his alarm. Turn up the Quieter. And let Mr.
Bigshot Harry Potter miss his first class, and be blamed for being
a heavy sleeper.</p>
<p>When Harry found out who'd done this...</p>
<p>No, this could only have been done with the cooperation of all
twelve other boys in the Ravenclaw dorm. All of them would have
seen his sleeping form. All of them had let him sleep through
breakfast.</p>
<p>The anger drained away, replaced by confusion and a horribly
wounded feeling. They'd <i>liked</i> him. He'd thought. Last night,
he'd thought they liked him. <i>Why...</i></p>
<p>As Harry stepped out of the bed, he saw a piece of paper facing
out from his headboard.</p>
<p>The paper said,</p>
<p><i>My fellow Ravenclaws,</i></p>
<p><i>It's been an extra long day. Please let me sleep in and don't
worry about my missing breakfast. I haven't forgotten about my
first class.</i></p>
<p><i>Yours,<br />
Harry Potter.</i></p>
<p>And Harry stood there, frozen, ice water beginning to trickle
through his veins.</p>
<p>The paper was in his own handwriting, in his own mechanical
pencil.</p>
<p>And he didn't remember writing it.</p>
<p>And... Harry squinted at the piece of paper. And unless he was
imagining it, the words "I haven't forgotten" were written in a
different style, as if he was trying to tell himself
something...?</p>
<p>Had he <i>known</i> he was going to be Obliviated? Had he stayed
up late, committed some sort of crime or covert activity, and
then... but he didn't <i>know</i> the Obliviate spell... had
someone else... what...</p>
<p>A thought occurred to Harry. If he <i>had</i> known he was going
to be Obliviated...</p>
<p>Still in his pyjamas, Harry ran around his bed to his trunk,
pressed his thumb against the lock, pulled out his pouch, stuck in
his hand and said "Note to myself."</p>
<p>And another piece of paper popped into his hand.</p>
<p>Harry took it out, staring at it. It too was in his own
handwriting.</p>
<p>The note said:</p>
<p><i>Dear Me,</i></p>
<p><i>Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a
lifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.</i></p>
<p><i>Recognition code 927, I am a potato.</i></p>
<p><i>Yours,<br />
You.</i></p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly. "Recognition code 927, I am a potato" was
indeed the message he had worked out in advance - some years
earlier, while watching TV - that only he would know. If he had to
identify a duplicate of himself as being really <i>him,</i> or
something. Just in case. Be Prepared.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't <i>trust</i> the message, there might be other
spells involved. But it ruled out any simple prank. He had
definitely written this and he definitely didn't remember writing
it.</p>
<p>Staring at the paper, Harry became aware of ink showing through
from the other side.</p>
<p>He flipped it over.</p>
<p>The reverse side read:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>you do not know the rules of the
game<br />
you do not know the stakes of the game<br />
you do not know the objective of the game</i><i><br />
you do not know who controls the game<br />
you do not know how to end the game</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>You start with 100 points.<br />
Begin.</i></p>
<p>Harry stared at the "instructions". This side wasn't
handwritten; the writing was perfectly regular, hence artificial.
It looked as if it had been inscribed by a Quotes Quill, such as
the one he'd bought to take dictation.</p>
<p>He had <i>absolutely no clue</i> what was going on.</p>
<p>Well... step one was to get dressed and eat. Maybe reverse the
order of that. His stomach felt rather empty.</p>
<p>He'd missed breakfast, of course, but he was Prepared for that
eventuality, having visualised it in advance. Harry put his hand
into his pouch and said "Snack bars", expecting to get the box of
cereal bars he'd bought before departing for Hogwarts.</p>
<p>What popped up did not feel like a box of cereal bars.</p>
<p>When Harry brought his hand into his field of vision he saw two
tiny candy bars - not nearly enough for a meal - attached to a
note, and the note was inscribed in the same writing as the game
instructions.</p>
<p>The note said:</p>
<p>ATTEMPT FAILED: -1 POINT<br />
CURRENT POINTS: 99<br />
PHYSICAL STATE: STILL HUNGRY<br />
MENTAL STATE: CONFUSED</p>
<p>"Gleehhhhh" Harry's mouth said without any sort of conscious
intervention or decision on his part.</p>
<p>He stood there for around a minute.</p>
<p>One minute later, it <i>still</i> didn't make any sense and he
<i>still</i> had absolutely no idea what was going on and his brain
hadn't even <i>begun</i> to grasp at any <i>hypotheses</i> like his
mental hands were encased in rubber balls and couldn't pick
anything up.</p>
<p>His stomach, which had its own priorities, suggested a possible
experimental probe.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said to the empty room. "I don't suppose I could
spend a point and get my box of cereal bars back?"</p>
<p>There was only silence.</p>
<p>Harry put his hand into the pouch and said "Box of cereal
bars."</p>
<p>A box that felt like the right shape popped up into his hand...
but it was too light, and it was open, and it was empty, and the
note attached to it said:</p>
<p>POINTS SPENT: 1<br />
CURRENT POINTS: 98<br />
YOU HAVE GAINED: A BOX OF CEREAL BARS</p>
<p>"I'd like to spend one point and get the <i>actual cereal
bars</i> back," said Harry.</p>
<p>Again, silence.</p>
<p>Harry put his hand into the pouch and said "cereal bars".</p>
<p>Nothing came up.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged despairingly and went over to the cabinet he'd
been given near his bed, to get his wizard's robes for the day.</p>
<p>On the floor of the cabinet, under his robes, were the cereal
bars, and a note:</p>
<p>POINTS SPENT: 1<br />
CURRENT POINTS: 97<br />
YOU HAVE GAINED: 6 CEREAL BARS<br />
YOU ARE STILL WEARING: PYJAMAS<br />
DO NOT EAT WHILE YOU ARE WEARING YOUR PYJAMAS<br />
YOU WILL GET A PYJAMA PENALTY</p>
<p><i>And now I know that whoever controls the game is
insane.</i></p>
<p>"My guess is that the game is controlled by Dumbledore," Harry
said out loud. Maybe <i>this</i> time he could set a new land speed
record for being quick on the uptake.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>But Harry was starting to pick up the pattern; the note would be
in the next place he looked. So Harry looked under his bed.</p>
<p>HA! HA HA HA HA HA!<br />
HA HA HA HA HA HA!<br />
HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!<br />
DUMBLEDORE DOES NOT CONTROL THE GAME<br />
BAD GUESS<br />
VERY BAD GUESS<br />
-20 POINTS<br />
AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS<br />
IT IS YOUR FOURTH MOVE<br />
AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS<br />
PYJAMA PENALTY: -2 POINTS<br />
CURRENT POINTS: 75</p>
<p>Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day
at school and once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the
name of anyone else here who was this crazy.</p>
<p>His body more or less on autopilot, Harry gathered up a set of
robes and underwear, pulled out the cavern level of his trunk (he
was a very private sort of person and someone might walk into the
dorm), got dressed, and then went back upstairs to put away his
pyjamas.</p>
<p>Harry paused before pulling out the cabinet drawer that held his
pyjamas. If the pattern here held true...</p>
<p>"How can I earn more points?" Harry said out loud.</p>
<p>Then he pulled out the drawer.</p>
<p>OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GOOD ARE EVERYWHERE<br />
BUT DARKNESS IS WHERE THE LIGHT NEEDS TO BE<br />
COST OF QUESTION: 1 POINT<br />
CURRENT POINTS: 74<br />
NICE UNDERWEAR<br />
DID YOUR MOTHER PICK THEM OUT?</p>
<p>Harry crushed the note in his hand, face flaming scarlet.
Draco's curse came back to him. <i>Son of a mudblood -</i></p>
<p>At this point he knew better than to say it out loud. He would
probably get a Profanity Penalty.</p>
<p>Harry girded himself with his mokeskin pouch and wand. He peeled
off the wrapper of one his cereal bars and threw it into the room's
rubbish bin, where it landed atop a mostly-uneaten Chocolate Frog,
a crumpled envelope and some green and red wrapping paper. He put
the other cereal bars into his mokeskin pouch.</p>
<p>He looked around in a final, desperate, and ultimately futile
search for clues.</p>
<p>And then Harry left the dorm, eating as he went, in search of
the Slytherin dungeons. At least that was what he <i>thought</i>
the line was about.</p>
<p>Trying to navigate the halls of Hogwarts was like... probably
<i>not</i> quite as bad as wandering around inside an Escher
painting, that was the sort of thing you said for rhetorical effect
rather than for its being true.</p>
<p>A short time later, Harry was thinking that in fact an Escher
painting would have both pluses and minuses compared to Hogwarts.
Minuses: No consistent gravitational orientation. Pluses: At least
the stairs wouldn't move around <i>WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON
THEM.</i></p>
<p>Harry had originally climbed four flights of stairs to get to
his dorm. After clambering down no fewer than twelve flights of
stairs without getting anywhere near the dungeons, Harry had
concluded that (1) an Escher painting would be a <i>cakewalk</i> by
comparison, (2) he was somehow <i>higher</i> in the castle than
when he'd started, and (3) he was so <i>thoroughly</i> lost that he
wouldn't have been surprised to look out of the next window and see
two moons in the sky.</p>
<p>Backup plan A had been to stop and ask for directions, but there
seemed to be an extreme lack of people wandering around, as if the
beggars were all attending class the way they were supposed to or
something.</p>
<p>Backup plan B...</p>
<p>"I'm lost," Harry said out loud. "Can, um, the spirit of the
Hogwarts castle help me or something?"</p>
<p>"I don't think this castle has a spirit," observed a wizened old
lady in one of the paintings on the walls. "Life, perhaps, but not
spirit."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>"Are you -" Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second
thought, no he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was
fully conscious in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness.</p>
<p>"I'm Harry Potter," said his mouth, more or less on autopilot.
Also more or less automatically, Harry stuck out a hand towards the
painting.</p>
<p>The woman in the painting looked down at Harry's hand and raised
her eyebrows.</p>
<p>Slowly, the hand dropped back to Harry's side.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said, "I'm sort of new here."</p>
<p>"So I perceive, young raven. Where are you trying to go?"</p>
<p>Harry hesitated. "I'm not really sure," he said.</p>
<p>"Then perhaps you are already there."</p>
<p>"Well, wherever I <i>am</i> trying to go, I don't think
<i>this</i> is it..." Harry shut his mouth, aware of just how much
he was sounding like an idiot. "Let me start over. I'm playing this
game only I don't know what the rules are -" That didn't really
work either, did it. "Okay, third try. I'm looking for
opportunities to do good so I can score points, and all I have is
this cryptic hint about how darkness is where the light needs to
be, so I was trying to go down but I seem to keep going up
instead..."</p>
<p>The old lady in the painting was looking at him rather
sceptically.</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "My life tends to get a bit peculiar."</p>
<p>"Would it be fair to say that you don't know where you're going
or why you're trying to get there?"</p>
<p>"<i>Entirely</i> fair."</p>
<p>The old lady nodded. "I'm not sure that being lost is your most
important problem, young man."</p>
<p>"True, but unlike the more important problems, it's a problem I
can understand how to solve and <i>wow</i> is this conversation
turning into a metaphor for human existence, I didn't even realise
that was happening until just now."</p>
<p>The lady eyed Harry appraisingly. "You <i>are</i> a fine young
raven, aren't you? For a moment I was starting to wonder. Well
then, as a general rule, if you keep on turning left, you're bound
to keep going down."</p>
<p>That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where
he'd heard it before. "Um... you seem like a very intelligent
person. Or a picture of a very intelligent person... anyway, have
you heard of a mysterious game where you can only play once, and
they won't tell you the rules?"</p>
<p>"Life," said the lady at once. "That's one of the most obvious
riddles I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "No," he said slowly. "I mean I got an actual
note and everything saying that I had to play the game but I
wouldn't be told the rules, and someone is leaving me little slips
of paper telling me how many points I've lost for violating the
rules, like a minus two point penalty for wearing pyjamas. Do you
know anyone here at Hogwarts who's crazy enough and powerful enough
to do something like that? Besides Dumbledore, I mean?"</p>
<p>The picture of a lady sighed. "I'm only a picture, young man. I
remember Hogwarts as it was - not Hogwarts as it is. All I can tell
you is that if this were a riddle, the answer would be that the
game is life, and that while we do not make all the rules
ourselves, the one who awards or takes points is always you. If it
is not riddle but reality - then I do not know."</p>
<p>Harry bowed very low to the picture. "Thank you, milady."</p>
<p>The lady curtseyed to him. "I wish I could say that I'll
remember you with fondness," she said, "but I probably won't
remember you at all. Farewell, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>He bowed again in reply, and started to climb down the nearest
flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Four left turns later he found himself staring down a corridor
that ended, abruptly, in a tumbled mound of large rocks - as if
there had been a cave-in, only the surrounding walls and ceiling
were intact and made of quite regular castle stones.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said to the empty air, "I give up. I'm asking
for another hint. How do I get to where I need to go?"</p>
<p>"A hint! A hint, you say?"</p>
<p>The excited voice came from a painting on the wall not far away,
this one a portrait of a middle-aged man in the loudest pink robes
that Harry had ever seen or even imagined. In the portrait he was
wearing a droopy old pointed hat with a fish on it (not a drawing
of a fish, mind, but a fish).</p>
<p>"Yes!" Harry said. "A hint! A hint, I say! Only not just
<i>any</i> hint, I'm looking for a <i>specific</i> hint, it's for a
game I'm playing -"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! A hint for the game! You're Harry Potter, aren't you?
I'm Cornelion Flubberwalt! I was told by Erin the Consort who was
told by Lord Weaselnose who was told by, I forget really. But it
was a message for <i>me</i> to give to you! For <i>me!</i> No one's
cared about me in, I don't know how long, maybe ever, I've been
stuck down here in this bloody useless old corridor - a hint! I
have your hint! It will only cost you three points! Do you want
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I want it!" Harry was aware that he probably ought to keep
his sarcasm under control but he just couldn't seem to help
himself.</p>
<p>"The darkness can be found between the green study rooms and
McGonagall's Transfiguration class! That's the hint! And get a move
on, you're slower than a sack of snails! Minus ten points for being
slow! Now you have 61 points! That was the rest of the
message!"</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said. He was really getting behind on the
game here. "Um... I don't suppose you know where the message
<i>originally</i> came from, do you?"</p>
<p>"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap
within the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's
what they told me!"</p>
<p>Harry was no longer sure, at this point, whether this was the
sort of thing he ought to be sceptical about, or the sort of thing
he should just take in stride. "And how can I find the line between
the green study rooms and Transfiguration class?"</p>
<p>"Just spin back around and go left, right, down, down, right,
left, right, up, and left again, you'll be at the green study room
and if you go in and walk straight out the opposite side you'll be
on a big curvy corridor that goes to an intersection and on the
right side of that intersection will be a long straight hallway
that goes to the Transfiguration classroom!" The figure of the
middle-aged man paused. "At least that's how it was when <i>I</i>
was in Hogwarts. This <i>is</i> a Monday on an odd-numbered year,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Pencil and mechanical paper," Harry said to his pouch. "Er,
cancel that, paper and mechanical pencil." He looked up. "Could you
repeat that?"</p>
<p>After getting lost another two times, Harry felt that he was
beginning to understand the basic rule for navigating the
ever-changing maze that was Hogwarts, namely, <i>ask a painting for
directions</i>. If this reflected some sort of incredibly deep life
lesson he couldn't figure out what it was.</p>
<p>The green study room was a surprisingly pleasant space with
sunlight streaming in from windows of green-stained glass that
showed dragons in calm, pastoral scenes. It had chairs that looked
extremely comfortable, and tables that seemed very well-suited to
studying in the company of one to three friends.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't <i>actually</i> walk straight through and out the
door on the other side. There were <i>bookshelves</i> set into the
wall, and he had to go over and read some of the titles, so as to
not lose his claim to the Verres family name. But he did it
quickly, mindful of the complaint about being slow, and then went
out the other side.</p>
<p>He was walking down the "big curvy corridor" when he heard a
young boy's voice cry out.</p>
<p>At times like this, Harry had an excuse to sprint all-out with
no regards for saving energy or doing proper warmup exercises or
worrying about crashing into things, a sudden frantic flight that
nearly came to an equally sudden halt as he almost ran over a group
of six first-year Hufflepuffs...</p>
<p>...who were huddled together, looking rather scared and like
they desperately wanted to do something but couldn't figure out
what, which probably had something to do with the group of five
older Slytherins who seemed to be surrounding another young
boy.</p>
<p>Harry was suddenly rather angry.</p>
<p>"<i>Excuse me!</i>" shouted Harry at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>It might not have been necessary. People were already looking at
him. But it certainly served to stop all the action cold.</p>
<p>Harry walked past the cluster of Hufflepuffs towards the
Slytherins.</p>
<p>They looked down at him with expressions that ranged from anger
to amusement to delight.</p>
<p>Part of Harry's brain was screaming in panic that these were
much older and bigger boys who could stomp him flat.</p>
<p>Another part said dryly that anyone caught seriously stomping
the Boy-Who-Lived was in for a whole <i>world</i> of trouble,
especially if they were a pack of older Slytherins and there were
seven Hufflepuffs who saw it, and that the chance of them doing him
any permanent damage in the presence of witnesses was nearly zero.
The only real weapon the older boys had against him was his own
fear, if he allowed that.</p>
<p>Then Harry saw that the boy they had trapped was Neville
Longbottom.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>That settled it. Harry had decided to apologise humbly to
Neville and that meant Neville was <i>his</i>, how <i>dare</i>
they?</p>
<p>Harry reached out and grabbed Neville by the wrist and
<i>yanked</i> him out from between the Slytherins, the boy
stumbling in shock as Harry pulled him out and in nearly the same
motion pushed his own way through the same gap.</p>
<p>And Harry stood in the center of the Slytherins where Neville
had stood, looking up at the much older, larger, and stronger
boys.</p>
<p>"Hello," Harry said. "I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>There was a rather awkward pause. No one seemed to know where
the conversation was supposed to go from there.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes dropped downwards and saw some books and papers
scattered around the floor. Oh, the old game where you let the boy
try to pick up his books and then knock them out of his hand again.
Harry couldn't remember ever being the object of that game himself,
but he had a good imagination and his imagination was making him
furious. Well, once the larger situation was resolved it would be
easy enough for Neville to come back and pick up his materials,
provided that the Slytherins stayed too intent on him to think of
doing anything to the books.</p>
<p>Unfortunately his straying eyes had been noted. "Ooh," said the
largest of the boys, "did 'oo want the widdle books -"</p>
<p>"Shut up," Harry said coldly. <i>Keep them off balance. Don't do
what they expect. Don't fall into a pattern that calls for them to
bully you.</i> "Is this part of some incredibly clever plan that
will gain you future advantage, or is it as pointless a disgrace to
the name of Salazar Slytherin as it -"</p>
<p>The largest boy shoved Harry Potter hard, and he went sprawling
out of the circle of Slytherins onto the hard stone floor of
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>And the Slytherins laughed.</p>
<p>Harry rose up in what seemed to him like terribly slow motion.
He didn't know yet how to use his wand, but there was no reason to
let that stop him, under the circumstances.</p>
<p>"I'd like to pay <i>as many points as it takes</i> to get rid of
this person," Harry said, pointing with his finger to the largest
Slytherin.</p>
<p>Then Harry lifted his other hand, said "Abracadabra," and
snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>At the word <i>Abracadabra</i> two of the Hufflepuffs screamed,
including Neville, three other Slytherins leapt desperately out of
the way of Harry's finger, and the largest Slytherin staggered back
with an expression of shock, a sudden splash of red decorating his
face and neck and chest.</p>
<p>Harry had <i>not</i> been expecting <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled
off the pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him. The
largest Slytherin held the pan in his hand for a moment, staring at
it, then dropped it to the floor.</p>
<p>It probably wasn't the best time in the world for one of the
Hufflepuffs to start laughing, but that was exactly what one of the
Hufflepuffs was doing.</p>
<p>Then Harry caught sight of the note on the bottom of the
pan.</p>
<p>"Hold on," Harry said, and darted forward to pick up the note.
"This note's for me, I think -"</p>
<p>"<i>You,"</i> growled the largest Slytherin, "<i>you, are,
going, to -</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Look</i> at this!" shouted Harry, brandishing the note at
the older Slytherin. "I mean, just <i>look</i> at this! Can you
believe I'm being charged 30 points for shipping and handling on
one lousy pie? 30 points! I'm turning a loss on the deal even after
rescuing an innocent boy in distress! And storage fees? Conveyance
charges? Drayage costs? How do you get <i>drayage costs</i> on a
<i>pie?</i>"</p>
<p>There was another one of those awkward pauses. Harry thought
deadly thoughts at whichever Hufflepuff couldn't seem to stop
giggling, that idiot was going to get him hurt.</p>
<p>Harry stepped back and shot the Slytherins his best lethal
glare. "Now go away or I will just keep making your existence more
and more surreal until you do. Let me warn you... messing with
<i>my</i> life tends to make <i>your</i> life... <i>a little
hairy.</i> Get it?"</p>
<p>In a single terrible motion, the largest Slytherin whipped his
wand out to point at Harry and in the same instant was hit on the
other side of his head by another pie, this one bright
blueberry.</p>
<p>The note on this pie was rather large and clearly readable. "You
might want to read the note on that pie," Harry observed. "I think
it's for you this time."</p>
<p>The Slytherin slowly reached up, took the pie pan, turned it
over with a wet glop that dropped more blueberry on the floor, and
read a note that said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>WARNING</u><br />
<u>NO</u> MAGIC MAY BE USED ON THE CONTESTANT<br />
WHILE THE GAME IS IN PROGRESS<br />
FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN THE GAME<br />
<u>WILL</u> BE REPORTED TO THE GAME AUTHORITIES</p>
<p>The expression of sheer bafflement on the Slytherin's face was a
look of art. Harry thought that he might be starting to like this
Game Controller.</p>
<p>"Look," Harry said, "you want to call it a day? I think things
are spiralling out of control here. How about you go back to
Slytherin and I go back to Ravenclaw and we all just cool down a
bit, okay?"</p>
<p>"I've got a better idea," hissed the largest Slytherin. "How
about if you accidentally break all your fingers?"</p>
<p>"How in Merlin's name do you stage a believable accident after
making the threat in front of a dozen witnesses, you <i>idiot</i>
-"</p>
<p>The largest Slytherin slowly, deliberately reached out towards
Harry's hands, and Harry froze in place, the part of his brain that
was noticing the other boy's age and strength finally managing to
make itself heard, screaming, <i>WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING?</i></p>
<p>"Wait!" said one of the other Slytherins, his voice suddenly
panicky. "Stop, you shouldn't actually do that!"</p>
<p>The largest Slytherin ignored him, taking Harry's right hand
firmly in his left hand, and taking Harry's index finger in his
right hand.</p>
<p>Harry stared the Slytherin straight in the eyes. Part of Harry
was screaming, this wasn't supposed to happen, this wasn't
<i>allowed</i> to happen, grownups would never let something like
this <i>actually</i> happen -</p>
<p>Slowly, the Slytherin started to bend his index finger
backwards.</p>
<p><i>He hasn't actually broken my finger and it is beneath me to
so much as flinch until he does. Until then, this is just another
attempt to cause fear.</i></p>
<p>"Stop!" said the Slytherin who had objected before. "Stop, this
is a very bad idea!"</p>
<p>"I rather agree," said an icy voice. An older woman's voice.</p>
<p>The largest Slytherin let go of Harry's hand and jumped
backwards as if burned.</p>
<p>"Professor Sprout!" cried one of the Hufflepuffs, sounding as
glad as anyone Harry had ever heard in his life.</p>
<p>Into Harry's field of vision, as he turned, stalked a dumpy
little woman with messily curled grey hair and clothes covered with
dirt. She pointed an accusing finger at the Slytherins. "Explain
yourselves," she said. "What are you doing with my Hufflepuffs
and..." she looked at him. "My fine student, Harry Potter."</p>
<p><i>Uh oh. That's right, it was HER class I missed this
morning.</i></p>
<p>"He threatened to kill us!" blurted one of the other Slytherins,
the same one who'd called for a halt.</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said blankly. "I did <i>not!</i> If I was going to
kill you I wouldn't make public threats first!"</p>
<p>A third Slytherin laughed helplessly and then stopped abruptly
as the other boys shot him deadly glares.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout had adopted a rather sceptical expression.
"What death threat would this be, exactly?"</p>
<p>"The Killing Curse! He pretended to use the Killing Curse on
us!"</p>
<p>Professor Sprout turned to look at Harry. "Yes, quite a terrible
threat from an eleven-year-old boy. Though still not something you
should <i>ever</i> dream of pretending, Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I don't even know the <i>words</i> to the Killing Curse," Harry
said promptly. "And I didn't have my wand out at any time."</p>
<p>Now Professor Sprout was giving Harry a sceptical look. "I
suppose this boy hit <i>himself</i> with two pies, then."</p>
<p>"He <i>didn't</i> use his wand!" blurted one of the young
Hufflepuffs. "I don't know how he did it either, he just snapped
his fingers and there was pie!"</p>
<p>"Really," said Professor Sprout after a pause. She drew her own
wand. "I won't require it, since you do seem to be the victim here,
but would you mind if I checked your wand to verify that?"</p>
<p>Harry took out his wand. "What do I -"</p>
<p>"<i>Prior Incantato,</i>" said Sprout. She frowned. "That's odd,
your wand doesn't seem to have been used at all."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "It hasn't, actually, I only got my wand and
schoolbooks a few days ago."</p>
<p>Sprout nodded. "Then we have a clear case of accidental magic
from a boy who felt threatened. And the rules plainly state that
you are not to be held responsible. As for <i>you...</i>" she
turned to the Slytherins. Her eyes dropped deliberately to
Neville's books lying on the floor.</p>
<p>There was a long silence during which she looked at the five
Slytherins.</p>
<p>"Three points from Slytherin, <i>each</i>," she said finally.
"And six from <i>him,</i>" pointing to the boy covered in pie.
"Don't you <i>ever</i> meddle with my Hufflepuffs again, or my
student Harry Potter either. Now <i>go.</i>"</p>
<p>She didn't have to repeat herself; the Slytherins turned and
walked away very quickly.</p>
<p>Neville went and started picking up his books. He seemed to be
crying, but only a little. It might have been from delayed shock,
or it might have been because the other boys were helping him.</p>
<p>"Thank you <i>very</i> much, Harry Potter," Professor Sprout
said to him. "Seven points to Ravenclaw, one for each Hufflepuff
you helped protect. And I won't say anything more."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. He'd been expecting something more along the
lines of a lecture about keeping himself out of trouble, and a
rather severe scolding for missing his very first class.</p>
<p>Maybe he <i>should</i> have gone to Hufflepuff. Sprout was
cool.</p>
<p>"<i>Scourgify,</i>" Sprout said to the mess of pie on the floor,
which promptly vanished.</p>
<p>And she left, walking along the hall that led to the green study
room.</p>
<p>"How did you <i>do</i> that?" hissed one of the Hufflepuff boys
as soon as she was gone.</p>
<p>Harry smiled smugly. "I can make anything I want happen just by
snapping my fingers."</p>
<p>The boy's eyes widened. "<i>Really?</i>"</p>
<p>"No," said Harry. "But when you're telling everyone this story
be sure to share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw,
she has an anecdote you might find amusing." He had absolutely no
clue what was happening, but he wasn't about to pass up the
opportunity to add to his growing legend. "Oh, and what was all
that about the Killing Curse?"</p>
<p>The boy gave him a strange look. "You really don't know?"</p>
<p>"If I did, I wouldn't be asking."</p>
<p>"The words to the Killing Curse are," the boy swallowed, and his
voice dropped to a whisper, and he held his hands away from his
sides as if to make it very clear that he wasn't holding a wand,
"<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>"</p>
<p><i>Well of course they are.</i></p>
<p>Harry put this on his growing list of things to never ever tell
his Dad, Professor Michael Verres-Evans. It was bad enough talking
about how you were the only person to survive the fearsome Killing
Curse, without having to admit that the Killing Curse was
"Abracadabra."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said after a pause. "Well, that's the last time I
ever say <i>that</i> before snapping my fingers." Though it
<i>had</i> produced an effect that might be tactically useful.</p>
<p>"<i>Why</i> did you -"</p>
<p>"Raised by Muggles, Muggles think it's a joke and that it's
funny. Seriously, that's what happened. Sorry, but can you remind
me of your name?"</p>
<p>"I'm Ernie Macmillan," said the Hufflepuff. He held out his
hand, and Harry shook it. "Honoured to meet you."</p>
<p>Harry executed a slight bow. "Pleased to meet you, skip the
honoured thing."</p>
<p>Then the other boys crowded round him and there was a sudden
flood of introductions.</p>
<p>When they were done, Harry swallowed. This was going to be very
difficult. "Um... if everyone would excuse me... I have something
to say to Neville -"</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Neville, who took a step back, his face
looking apprehensive.</p>
<p>"I suppose," Neville said in a tiny voice, "you're going to say
I should've been braver -"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, nothing like that!" Harry said hastily. "Nothing to do
with <i>that</i>. It's just, um, something the Sorting Hat told me
-"</p>
<p>Suddenly the other boys looked <i>very</i> interested, except
for Neville, who was looking even <i>more</i> apprehensive.</p>
<p>There seemed to be something blocking Harry's throat. He knew he
should just blurt it out, and it was like he'd swallowed a large
brick that was just stuck in the way.</p>
<p>It was like Harry had to manually take control of his lips and
produce each syllable individually, but he managed to make it
happen. "I'm, sor, ry." He exhaled and took a deep breath. "For
what I did, um, the other day. You... don't have to be gracious
about it or anything, I'll understand if you just hate me. This
isn't about me trying to look cool by apologising or your having to
accept it. What I did was wrong."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Neville clutched his books tighter to his chest. "Why did you do
it?" he said in a thin, wavering voice. He blinked, as if trying to
hold back tears. "Why does <i>everyone</i> do that to me, even the
Boy-Who-Lived?"</p>
<p>Harry suddenly felt smaller than he ever had in his life. "I'm
sorry," Harry said again, his voice now hoarsened. "It's just...
you looked so scared, it was like a sign over your head saying
'victim', and I wanted to show you that things <i>don't</i> always
turn out badly, that sometimes the monsters give you chocolate... I
thought if I showed you that, you might realise there wasn't so
much to be afraid of -"</p>
<p>"But there <i>is,</i>" whispered Neville. "You saw it today,
there <i>is!</i>"</p>
<p>"They wouldn't have done anything really bad in front of
witnesses. Their main weapon is fear. That's why they target
<i>you,</i> because they can see you're afraid. I wanted to make
you less afraid... show you that the fear was worse than the thing
itself... or that was what I told myself, but the Sorting Hat told
me that I was lying to myself and that I really did it because it
was fun. So that's why I'm apologising -"</p>
<p>"You hurt me," said Neville. "Just now. When you grabbed me and
pulled me away from them." Neville held out his arm and pointed to
where Harry had grabbed him. "I might have a bruise here later from
how hard you pulled. You hurt me worse than anything the Slytherins
did by bumping into me, actually."</p>
<p>"<i>Neville!</i>" hissed Ernie. "He was trying to <i>save</i>
you!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," whispered Harry. "When I saw that I just got...
really angry..."</p>
<p>Neville looked at him steadily. "So you yanked me out really
hard and put yourself in where I was and went, 'Hello, I'm the
Boy-Who-Lived'."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"I think you're going to be really cool someday," Neville said.
"But right now, you're not."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed the sudden knot in his throat and walked away.
He continued down the corridor to the intersection, then turned
left into a hallway and kept on walking, blindly.</p>
<p>What was he <i>supposed</i> to do here? Never get angry? He
wasn't sure he could have done anything without being angry and who
knows what would have happened to Neville and his books then.
Besides, Harry had read enough fantasy books to know how
<i>this</i> one went. He would try to suppress the anger and he
would fail and it would keep coming out again. And after this whole
long journey of self-discovery he would learn at the end that his
anger was a part of himself and that only by accepting it could he
learn to use it wisely. <i>Star Wars</i> was the only universe in
which the answer actually <i>was</i> that you were supposed to cut
yourself off completely from negative emotions, and something about
Yoda had always made Harry hate the little green moron.</p>
<p>So the obvious time-saving plan was to skip the journey of
self-discovery and go straight to the part where he realised that
only by accepting his anger as a part of himself could he stay in
control of it.</p>
<p>The problem was that he didn't <i>feel</i> out of control when
he was angry. The cold rage made him feel like he was <i>in</i>
control. It was only when he looked back that <i>events as a
whole</i> seemed to have... blown up out of control, somehow.</p>
<p>He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort
of thing, and whether he'd won or lost points for it. Harry himself
felt like he'd lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old
lady in the picture would have told him that his was the only
opinion that mattered.</p>
<p>And Harry was also wondering whether the Game Controller had
sent Professor Sprout. It was the logical thought: the note had
threatened to notify the Game Authorities, and then there Professor
Sprout was. Maybe Professor Sprout <i>was</i> the Game Controller -
the <i>Head of House Hufflepuff</i> would be the <i>last</i> person
anyone would suspect, which ought to put her near the top of
Harry's list. He'd read one or two mystery novels, too.</p>
<p>"So how am I doing in the game?" Harry said out loud.</p>
<p>A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it
from behind him - Harry turned around, but there was no one there -
and when Harry turned forwards again, the note was settling to the
floor.</p>
<p>The note said:</p>
<p>POINTS FOR STYLE: 10<br />
POINTS FOR GOOD THINKING: -3,000,000<br />
RAVENCLAW HOUSE POINTS BONUS: 70<br />
CURRENT POINTS: -2,999,871<br />
TURNS REMAINING: 2</p>
<p>"<i>Minus three million points?"</i> Harry said indignantly to
the empty hallway. "That seems excessive! I want to file an appeal
with the Game Authorities! And how am I supposed to make up three
million points in the next two turns?"</p>
<p>Another note flew over his head.</p>
<p>APPEAL: FAILED<br />
ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS<br />
CURRENT POINTS: -1,000,002,999,871<br />
TURNS REMAINING: 1</p>
<p>Harry gave up. With one turn remaining all he could do was take
his best shot, even if it wasn't very good. "My guess is that the
game represents life."</p>
<p>A final sheet of paper flew over his head, reading:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ATTEMPT FAILED<br />
FAILED FAILED FAILED<br />
AIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br />
CURRENT POINTS: MINUS INFINITY<br />
<u>YOU HAVE LOST THE GAME</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">FINAL INSTRUCTION:<i><br />
go to Professor McGonagall's office</i></p>
<p>The last line was in his own handwriting.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the last line for a while, then shrugged. Fine.
Professor McGonagall's office it would be. If <i>she</i> was the
Game Controller...</p>
<p>Okay, honestly, Harry had absolutely no idea how he would feel
if Professor McGonagall was the Game Controller. His mind was just
drawing a complete blank. It was, literally, unimaginable.</p>
<p>A couple of portraits later - it wasn't a long trip, Professor
McGonagall's office wasn't far from her Transfiguration classroom,
at least not on Mondays on odd-numbered years - Harry stood outside
the door to her office.</p>
<p>He knocked.</p>
<p>"Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.</p>
<p>He entered.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="14">Chapter 14</h2><h3>The Unknown and the
Unknowable</h3>
<p>Melenkurion abatha! Duroc minas mill J. K. Rowling!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious answer was
a contradiction in terms.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.</p>
<p>Harry did so.</p>
<p>The office of the Deputy Headmistress was clean and
well-organised; on the wall immediately adjacent to the desk was a
maze of wooden cubbyholes of all shapes and sizes, most with
several parchment scrolls thrust into them, and it was somehow very
clear that Professor McGonagall knew exactly what every cubbyhole
meant, even if no one else did. A single parchment lay on the
actual desk, which was, aside from that, clean. Behind the desk was
a closed door barred with several locks.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was sitting on a backless stool behind the
desk, looking puzzled - her eyes had widened, with perhaps a slight
note of apprehension, as she saw Harry.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall. "What is this
about?"</p>
<p>Harry's mind went blank. He'd been instructed by the game to
come here, he had been expecting <i>her</i> to have something in
mind...</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall, starting to look
slightly annoyed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Harry's panicking brain remembered at this point
that he <i>did</i> have something he'd been planning to discuss
with Professor McGonagall. Something important and well worth her
time.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "If there are any spells you can cast to
make sure no one's listening to us..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall stood up from her chair, firmly closed the
outer door, and began taking out her wand and saying spells.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a
priceless and possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor
McGonagall a Comed-Tea and he couldn't believe he was seriously
thinking that and it would be fine the soda would vanish after a
few seconds and he told that part of himself to <i>shut up.</i></p>
<p>It did, and Harry began to organise mentally what he was going
to say. He hadn't planned to have this discussion <i>quite</i> so
soon, but so long as he was here...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall finished a spell that sounded a lot older
than Latin, and then she sat down again.</p>
<p>"All right," she said in a quiet voice. "No one's listening."
Her face was rather tight.</p>
<p><i>Oh, right, she's expecting me to blackmail her for
information about the prophecy.</i></p>
<p>Eh, Harry'd get around to that some other day.</p>
<p>"It's about the Incident with the Sorting Hat," Harry said.
(Professor McGonagall blinked.) "Um... I think there's an extra
spell on the Sorting Hat, something that the Sorting Hat itself
doesn't know about, something that triggers when the Sorting Hat
says Slytherin. I heard a message that I'm pretty sure Ravenclaws
aren't supposed to hear. It came the moment the Sorting Hat was off
my head and I felt the connection break. It sounded like a hiss and
like English at the same time," there was a sharp intake of breath
from McGonagall, "and it said: Salutations from Slytherin to
Slytherin, if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at
Harry as if he'd grown another two heads.</p>
<p>"So..." Professor McGonagall said slowly, as though she couldn't
believe the words that were coming out of her own lips, "you
decided to come to me right away and tell me about it."</p>
<p>"Well, yes, of course," Harry said. There was no need to admit
how long it had taken him to actually think of that. "As opposed
to, say, trying to research it myself, or telling any of the other
children."</p>
<p>"I... see," Professor McGonagall said. "And if, perhaps, you
were to discover the entrance to Salazar Slytherin's legendary
Chamber of Secrets, an entrance that you and you alone could
open..."</p>
<p>"I would close the entrance and report to you at once so that a
team of experienced magical archaeologists could be assembled,"
Harry said promptly. "Then I would open up the entrance again and
they would go in very carefully to make sure that there was nothing
dangerous. I might go in later to look around, or if they needed me
to open up something else, but it would be after the area had been
declared clear and they had photographs of how everything looked
before people started tromping around their priceless historical
site."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at
him like he'd just turned into a cat.</p>
<p>"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said
kindly.</p>
<p>"I think," Professor McGonagall said in a rather choked voice,
"that you <i>far</i> underestimate the rarity of common sense, Mr.
Potter."</p>
<p>That sounded about right. Although... "A Hufflepuff would've
said the same thing."</p>
<p>McGonagall paused, struck. "<i>That's</i> true."</p>
<p>"Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff."</p>
<p>She blinked at him as though she couldn't believe her own ears.
"Did it <i>really?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, "five
decades ago was the last time a student died within the walls of
Hogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last
time someone heard that message."</p>
<p>A chill went through Harry. "Then I will be <i>very</i> sure to
take no action <i>whatsoever</i> on this matter without consulting
you, Professor McGonagall." He paused. "And may I suggest that you
get together the best people you can find and see if it's possible
to get that extra spell off the Sorting Hat... and if you can't do
that, maybe put on <i>another</i> spell, a Quietus that briefly
activates just as the Hat is being removed from a student's head,
that might work as a patch. There, no more dead students." Harry
nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked even more stunned, if such a thing
were imaginable. "I cannot <i>possibly</i> award you enough points
for this without giving the House Cup to Ravenclaw outright."</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "Um. I'd rather not earn <i>that</i> many
House points."</p>
<p>Now Professor McGonagall was giving him a strange look. "Why
not?"</p>
<p>Harry was having a little difficulty putting it into words.
"Because it would be just too sad, you know? Like... like back when
I was still trying to go to school in the Muggle world, and
whenever there was a group project, I'd go ahead and do the whole
thing myself because the others would only slow me down. I'm fine
with earning lots of points, more than anyone else even, but if I
earn enough to be decisive in winning the House Cup just by myself,
then it's like I'm carrying House Ravenclaw on my back and that's
too sad."</p>
<p>"I see..." McGonagall said hesitantly. It was apparent that this
way of thinking had never occurred to her. "Suppose I only awarded
you fifty points, then?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children
if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of
and they can't. How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for
reporting a whisper he heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn't be
fair at all."</p>
<p>"I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff," said
Professor McGonagall. She was eyeing him with a strange
respect.</p>
<p>That made Harry choke up a bit. He'd honestly thought he wasn't
worthy of Hufflepuff. That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to
shove him anywhere but Ravenclaw, into a House whose virtues he
didn't have...</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was smiling now. "And if I tried to give
you <i>ten</i> points...?"</p>
<p>"Are you going to explain where those ten points came from, if
anyone asks? There might be a lot of Slytherins, and I don't mean
the children at Hogwarts, who would be really <i>really</i> angry
if they knew about the spell being taken off the Sorting Hat and
found out I was involved. So I think that absolute secrecy is the
better part of valour. No need to thank me, ma'am, virtue is its
own reward."</p>
<p>"So it is," Professor McGonagall said, "but I do have a very
special something else to give you. I see that I have greatly
wronged you in my thoughts, Mr. Potter. Please wait here."</p>
<p>She got up, went over to the locked back door, waved her wand,
and a sort of blurry curtain sprang up around her. Harry could
neither see nor hear what was going on. It was a few minutes later
that the blur vanished and Professor McGonagall was standing there,
facing him, with the door behind her looking as though it hadn't
ever been opened.</p>
<p>And Professor McGonagall held out in one hand a necklace, a thin
golden chain bearing in its center a silver circle, within which
was the device of an hourglass. In her other hand was a folded
pamphlet. "This is for you," she said.</p>
<p>Wow! He was going to get some sort of neat magical item as a
quest reward! Apparently that business with refusing offers of
monetary rewards until you got a magic item actually worked in real
life, not just computer games.</p>
<p>Harry accepted his new necklace, smiling. "What is it?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall took a breath. "Mr. Potter, this is an item
which is ordinarily lent only to children who have already shown
themselves to be highly responsible, in order to help them with
difficult class schedules." McGonagall hesitated, as though about
to add something else. "I <i>must</i> emphasise, Mr. Potter, that
this item's true nature is <i>secret</i> and that you must
<i>not</i> tell any of the other students about it, or let them see
you using it. If that's not acceptable to you, then you can give it
back now."</p>
<p>"I can keep secrets," Harry said. "So what does it do?"</p>
<p>"So far as the other students are concerned, this is a Spimster
wicket and it is used to treat a rare, non-contagious magical
ailment called Spontaneous Duplication. You wear it under your
clothes, and while you have no reason to show it to anyone, you
also have no reason to treat it as an awful secret. Spimster
wickets are not interesting. Do you understand, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, his smile widening. He sensed the work of a
<i>competent</i> Slytherin. "And what does it <i>really</i>
do?"</p>
<p>"It's a Time-Turner. Each spin of the hourglass sends you one
hour back in time. So if you use it to go back two hours every day,
you should always be able to get to sleep at the same time."</p>
<p>Harry's suspension of disbelief blew completely out the
window.</p>
<p><i>You're giving me a time machine to treat my sleep
disorder.</i></p>
<p><i>You're giving me a TIME MACHINE to treat my SLEEP
DISORDER.</i></p>
<p><i>YOU'RE <b>GIVING ME A TIME MACHINE</b> IN ORDER TO <b>TREAT
MY SLEEP DISORDER</b>.</i></p>
<p>"Ehehehehhheheh..." Harry's mouth said. He was now holding the
necklace away from him as though it were a live bomb. Well, no, not
as if it were a live bomb, that didn't <i>begin</i> to describe the
severity of the situation. Harry held the necklace away from him as
though it were a time machine.</p>
<p><i>Say, Professor McGonagall, did you know that time-reversed
ordinary matter looks just like antimatter? Why yes it does! Did
you know that one kilogram of antimatter encountering one kilogram
of matter will annihilate in an explosion equivalent to 43 million
tons of TNT? Do you realise that I myself weigh 41 kilograms and
that the resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING CRATER WHERE
THERE USED TO BE SCOTLAND?</i></p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry managed to say, "but this sounds really
really <i>really REALLY DANGEROUS!</i>" Harry's voice didn't quite
rise to a shriek, he couldn't possibly scream loud enough to do
this situation justice so there was no point in trying.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked upon him with tolerant affection.
"I'm glad you're taking this seriously, Mr. Potter, but
Time-Turners aren't <i>that</i> dangerous. We wouldn't give them to
children if they were."</p>
<p>"Really," Harry said. "Ahahahaha. Of course you wouldn't give
time machines to children if they were dangerous, what <i>was</i> I
thinking? So just to be clear, sneezing on this device will
<i>not</i> send me into the Middle Ages where I will run over
Gutenberg with a horse cart and prevent the Enlightenment? Because,
you know, I hate it when that happens to me."</p>
<p>McGonagall's lips were twitching in that way she had when she
was trying not to smile. She offered Harry the pamphlet she was
holding, but Harry was carefully holding out the necklace with both
hands and staring at the hourglass to make sure it wasn't about to
turn. "Don't worry," McGonagall said after a momentary pause, when
it became clear that Harry wasn't going to move, "that can't
possibly happen, Mr. Potter. The Time-Turner cannot be used to move
more than six hours backwards. It can't be used more than six times
in any day."</p>
<p>"Oh, good, very good, that. And if someone bumps into me the
Time-Turner will <i>not</i> break and will <i>not</i> trap the
whole castle of Hogwarts in an endlessly repeating loop of
Thursdays."</p>
<p>"Well, they <i>can</i> be fragile..." said McGonagall. "And I do
think I've heard about strange things happening if they're broken.
But nothing like <i>that!</i>"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Harry said when he could speak again, "you ought to
provide your time machines with some sort of <i>protective
shell</i>, rather than <i>leaving the glass exposed</i>, so as to
<i>prevent that from happening</i>."</p>
<p>McGonagall looked quite struck. "That's an excellent idea, Mr.
Potter. I shall inform the Ministry of it."</p>
<p><i>That's it, it's official now, they've ratified it in
Parliament, everyone in the wizarding world is completely
stupid.</i></p>
<p>"And while I hate to get all <i>PHILOSOPHICAL,</i>" Harry
desperately tried to lower his voice to something under a shriek,
"has anyone thought about the <i>IMPLICATIONS</i> of going back six
hours and doing something that changes time which would pretty much
<i>DELETE ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED</i> and <i>REPLACE THEM WITH
DIFFERENT VERSIONS -</i>"</p>
<p>"Oh, you can't <i>change</i> time!" Professor McGonagall
interrupted. "Good heavens, Mr. Potter, do you think these would be
allowed students if <i>that</i> was possible? What if someone tried
to change their test scores?"</p>
<p>Harry took a moment to process this. His hands relaxed, just a
little, from their white grip on the hourglass chain. Like he
wasn't holding a time machine, just a live nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>"So..." Harry said slowly. "People just find that the
universe... happens to be self-consistent, somehow, even though it
has time-travel in it. If I and my future self interact then I'll
see the same thing as both of me, even though, on my own first run
through, my future self is already acting in full knowledge of
things that, from my own perspective, haven't happened yet..."
Harry's voice trailed off into the inadequacy of English.</p>
<p>"Correct, I think," said Professor McGonagall. "Although wizards
<i>are</i> advised to avoid being seen by their past selves. If
you're attending two classes at the same time and you need to cross
paths with yourself, for example, the first version of you should
step aside and close his eyes at a known time - you have a watch
already, good - so that the future you can pass. It's all there in
the pamphlet."</p>
<p>"Ahahahaa. And what happens when someone <i>ignores</i> that
advice?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. "I understand that it can
be quite disconcerting."</p>
<p>"And it doesn't, say, create a paradox that destroys the
universe."</p>
<p>She smiled tolerantly. "Mr. Potter, I think I'd remember hearing
if <i>that</i> had ever happened."</p>
<p>"<i>THAT IS NOT REASSURING! HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF THE
ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE? AND WHAT IDIOT EVER BUILT ONE OF THESE THINGS
FOR THE FIRST TIME?</i>"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall actually laughed. It was a pleasant, glad
sound that seemed surprisingly out of place on that stern face.
"You're having another 'you turned into a cat' moment, aren't you,
Mr. Potter. You probably don't want to hear this, but it's quite
endearingly cute."</p>
<p>"Turning into a cat doesn't even <i>BEGIN</i> to compare to
this. You know right up until this moment I had this awful
suppressed thought somewhere in the back of my mind that the only
remaining answer was that my whole universe was a computer
simulation like in the book <i>Simulacron 3</i> but now <i>even
that is ruled out</i> because this little toy <i>ISN'T TURING
COMPUTABLE!</i> A Turing machine could simulate going back into a
defined moment of the past and computing a different future from
there, an oracle machine could rely on the halting behavior of
lower-order machines, but what you're saying is that reality
somehow self-consistently computes in one sweep using information
that hasn't... happened... yet..."</p>
<p>Realisation struck Harry a pile-driver blow.</p>
<p>It all made sense now. It all <i>finally</i> made sense.</p>
<p>"<i>SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS!</i> Of <i>course!</i> The
spell doesn't <i>force</i> funny events to happen, it just makes
you <i>feel an impulse to drink</i> right before funny things are
going to happen anyway! I'm such a fool, I should have realised
when I felt the impulse to drink the Comed-Tea before Dumbledore's
second speech, <i>didn't</i> drink it, and then choked on my own
saliva instead - drinking the Comed-Tea doesn't cause the comedy,
the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea! I saw the two events
were correlated and assumed the Comed-Tea had to be the cause and
the comedy had to be the effect because I thought temporal order
restrained causation and causal graphs had to be acyclic BUT IT ALL
MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS GOING <i>BACKWARDS IN
TIME!</i>"</p>
<p>Realisation struck Harry the <i>second</i> pile-driver.</p>
<p>This one he managed to keep quiet, making only a small
strangling sound like a dying kitten as he realised who'd put the
note on his bed this morning.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's eyes were alight. "After you graduate, or
possibly even before, you really <i>must</i> teach some of these
Muggle theories at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter. They sound quite
fascinating, even if they're all wrong."</p>
<p>"Glehhahhh..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall offered him a few more pleasantries,
demanded a few more promises to which Harry nodded, said something
about not talking to snakes where anyone could hear him, reminded
him to read the pamphlet, and then somehow Harry found himself
standing outside her office with the door closed firmly behind
him.</p>
<p>"Gaahhhrrrraa..." Harry said.</p>
<p>Why yes his mind <i>was</i> blown.</p>
<p>Not least by the fact that, if not for the Prank, he might well
have never obtained a Time-Turner in the first place.</p>
<p>Or would Professor McGonagall have given it to him anyway, only
later in the day, whenever he got around to asking about his sleep
disorder or telling her about the Sorting Hat's message? And would
he, at that time, have wanted to pull a prank on himself which
would have led to him getting the Time-Turner <i>earlier?</i> So
that the only <i>self-consistent</i> possibility was the one in
which the Prank started before he even woke up in the
morning...?</p>
<p>Harry found himself considering, for the first time in his life,
that the answer to his question might be literally
<i>inconceivable.</i> That since his own brain contained neurons
that only ran forwards in time, there was <i>nothing</i> his brain
could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugate to the
operation of a Time Turner.</p>
<p>Up until this point Harry had lived by the admonition of E. T.
Jaynes that if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a
fact about your own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon
itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact
about whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in
the mind, not in reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a
blank territory. There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious
answer was a contradiction in terms. A phenomenon could be
mysterious <i>to</i> some particular person, but there could be no
phenomena mysterious of themselves. To worship a sacred mystery was
just to worship your own ignorance.</p>
<p>So Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated.
People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and
biology and astronomy and thought that these matters had always
been the proper meat of science, that they had <i>never been</i>
mysterious. The stars had once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once
called the nature of life and biology - the response of muscles to
human will and the generation of trees from seeds - a mystery
"infinitely beyond" the reach of science. (Not just a little
beyond, mind you, but <i>infinitely</i> beyond. Lord Kelvin
certainly had felt a huge emotional charge from <i>not knowing
something</i>.) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from
the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, he was up against the prospect of a
mystery that was threatening to be <i>permanent</i>. If Time didn't
work by acyclic causal networks then Harry didn't understand what
was meant by cause and effect; and if Harry didn't understand
causes and effects then he didn't understand what sort of stuff
reality might be made of instead; and it was entirely possible that
his human mind never <i>could</i> understand, because his brain was
made of <i>old-fashioned linear-time neurons,</i> and this had
turned out to be an impoverished subset of reality.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the Comed-Tea, which had once seemed
all-powerful and all-unbelievable, had turned out to have a much
simpler explanation. Which he'd missed <i>merely</i> because the
truth was completely outside his hypothesis space or anything that
his brain had evolved to comprehend. But now he actually <i>had</i>
figured it, probably. Which was sort of encouraging. Sort of.</p>
<p>Harry glanced down at his watch. It was nearly 11AM, he'd gotten
to sleep last night at 1AM, so in the natural state of affairs he'd
go to sleep tonight at 3AM. So to go to sleep at 10PM and wake up
at 7AM, he should go back five hours total. Which meant that if he
wanted to get back to his dorm at around 6AM, before anyone was
awake, he'd better hurry up and...</p>
<p>Even in <i>retrospect</i> Harry didn't understand how he'd
pulled off <i>half</i> the stuff involved in the Prank. Where had
the <i>pie</i> come from?</p>
<p>Harry was starting to seriously fear time travel.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he had to admit that it <i>had</i> been an
irreplaceable opportunity. A prank you could only pull on yourself
once in a lifetime, within six hours of when you first found out
about Time-Turners.</p>
<p>In fact that was even <i>more</i> puzzling, when Harry thought
about it. Time had presented him with the finished Prank as a
<i>fait accompli,</i> and yet it was, quite clearly, his own
handiwork. Concept and execution and writing style. Every last
part, even the ones he still didn't understand.</p>
<p>Well, time was a-wasting and there were at most thirty hours in
a day. Harry did know <i>some</i> of what he had to do, and he
might figure out the rest, like the pie, while he was working.
There was no point putting it off. He couldn't exactly accomplish
anything stuck here in the <i>future.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his
robes pulled up over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in
case someone was already up and about and saw him at the same time
as Harry lying in his bed. He didn't want to have to explain to
anyone about his little medical problem with Spontaneous
Duplication.</p>
<p>Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep.</p>
<p>And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green
paper with a bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed. The
perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it
wasn't Christmas.</p>
<p>Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case
someone had their Quieter turned down low.</p>
<p>There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear
wax without a seal impressed.</p>
<p>Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter
inside.</p>
<p>The letter said:</p>
<p><i>This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell, passed
down through his descendants the Potters. Unlike lesser cloaks and
spells it has the power to keep you <u>hidden</u>, not merely
invisible. Your father lent it to me to study shortly before he
died, and I confess that I have received much good use of it over
the years.</i></p>
<p><i>In the future I shall have to get along with Disillusionment,
I fear. It is time the Cloak was returned to you, its heir. I had
thought to make this a Christmas present, but it wished to come
back to your hand before then. It seems to expect you to have need
of it. Use it well.</i></p>
<p><i>No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of wonderful
pranks, as your father committed in his day. If his full misdeeds
were known, every woman in Gryffindor would gather to desecrate his
grave. I shall not try to stop history from repeating, but be MOST
careful not to reveal yourself. If Dumbledore saw a chance to
possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he would never let it escape
his grasp until the day he died.</i></p>
<p><i>A Very Merry Christmas to you.</i></p>
<p>The note was unsigned.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hold on," Harry said, pulling up short as the other boys were
about to leave the Ravenclaw dorm. "Sorry, there's something else
I've got to do with my trunk. I'll be along to breakfast in a
couple of minutes."</p>
<p>Terry Boot scowled at Harry. "You'd better not be planning to go
through any of our things."</p>
<p>Harry held up one hand. "I swear that I intend to do nothing of
the sort to any of your things, that I only intend to access
objects that I myself own, that I have no pranking or otherwise
questionable intentions towards any of you, and that I do not
anticipate those intentions changing before I get to breakfast in
the Great Hall."</p>
<p>Terry frowned. "Wait, is that -"</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said Penelope Clearwater, who was there to guide
them. "There were no loopholes. Well-worded, Potter, you should be
a lawyer."</p>
<p>Harry Potter blinked at that. Ah, yes, Ravenclaw <i>prefect.</i>
"Thank you," he said. "I think."</p>
<p>"When you try to find the Great Hall, you will get lost."
Penelope stated this in the tones of a flat, unarguable fact. "As
soon as you do, ask a portrait how to get to the first floor. Ask
another portrait the <i>instant</i> you suspect you might be lost
again. <i>Especially</i> if it seems like you're going up higher
and higher. If you are higher than the whole castle ought to be,
<i>stop</i> and wait for search parties. Otherwise we shall see you
again four months later and you will be five months older and
dressed in a loincloth and covered in snow and <i>that's if you
stay inside the castle.</i>"</p>
<p>"Understood," said Harry, swallowing hard. "Um, shouldn't you
tell students all that sort of stuff right away?"</p>
<p>Penelope sighed. "What, <i>all</i> of it? That would take weeks.
You'll pick it up as you go along." She turned to go, followed by
the other students. "If I don't see you at breakfast in thirty
minutes, Potter, I'll start the search."</p>
<p>Once everyone was gone, Harry attached the note to his bed -
he'd already written it and all the other notes, working in his
cavern level before everyone else woke up. Then he carefully
reached inside the Quietus field and pulled the Cloak of
Invisibility off Harry-1's still-sleeping form.</p>
<p>And just for the sake of mischief, Harry put the Cloak into
Harry-1's pouch, knowing it would thereby already be in his
own.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"I can see that the message is passed on to Cornelion
Flubberwalt," said the painting of a man with aristocratic airs
and, in fact, a perfectly normal nose. "But might I ask where it
came from <i>originally?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged with artful helplessness. "I was told that it was
spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within the
air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Hey!" Hermione said in tones of indignation from her place on
the other side of the breakfast table. "That's <i>everyone's</i>
dessert! You can't just take one whole pie and put it in your
pouch!"</p>
<p>"I'm not taking one pie, I'm taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta
run now!" Harry ignored the cries of outrage and left the Great
Hall. He needed to arrive at Herbology class a little early.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Professor Sprout eyed him sharply. "And how do <i>you</i> know
what the Slytherins are planning?"</p>
<p>"I can't name my source," Harry said. "In fact I have to ask you
to pretend that this conversation never happened. Just act like you
happened across them naturally while you were on an errand, or
something. I'll run on ahead as soon as Herbology gets out. I think
I can distract the Slytherins until you get there. I'm not easy to
scare or bully, and I don't think they'll dare to seriously hurt
the Boy-Who-Lived. Though... I'm not asking you to run in the
hallways, but I would appreciate it if you didn't dawdle along the
way."</p>
<p>Professor Sprout looked at him for a long moment, then her
expression softened. "Please be careful with yourself, Harry
Potter. And... thank you."</p>
<p>"Just be sure not to be late," Harry said. "And remember, when
you get there, you weren't expecting to see me and this
conversation never happened."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was horrible, watching himself yank Neville out of the circle
of Slytherins. Neville had been right, he'd used too much force,
way too much force.</p>
<p>"Hello," Harry Potter said coldly. "I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>Eight first-year boys, mostly the same height. One of them had a
scar on his forehead and he wasn't acting like the others.</p>
<p><i>Oh wad some power the giftie gie us<br />
To see oursel's as others see us!<br />
It wad frae monie a blunder free us,<br />
And foolish notion -</i></p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was right. The Sorting Hat was right. It
was clear once you saw it from the outside.</p>
<p>There was something wrong with Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Harry dipped a finger in the glass of water on his desk. It
should have been cool. But lukewarm it was, and lukewarm it had
stayed. Again.</p>
<p>Harry was feeling very, very cheated.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of fantasy novels scattered around the
Verres household. Harry had read quite a few. And it was starting
to look like he had a mysterious dark side. So after the glass of
water had refused to cooperate the first few times, Harry had
glanced around the Charms classroom to make sure no one was
watching, and then taken a deep breath, concentrated, and made
himself angry. Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and
the game where someone knocked down your books every time you tried
to pick them up again. Thought about what Draco Malfoy had said
about the ten-year-old Lovegood girl and how the Wizengamot really
operated...</p>
<p>And the fury had entered his blood, he had held out his wand in
a hand that trembled with hate and said in cold tones
"<i>Frigideiro!</i>" and absolutely nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Harry had been <i>gypped.</i> He wanted to write someone and
demand a <i>refund</i> on his dark side which clearly <i>ought</i>
to have irresistible magical power but had turned out to be
<i>defective.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Frigideiro!</i>" said Hermione again from the desk next to
him. Her water was solid ice and there were white crystals forming
on the rim of her glass. She seemed to be totally intent on her own
work and not at all conscious of the other students staring at her
with hateful eyes, which was either (a) dangerously oblivious of
her or (b) a perfectly honed performance rising to the level of
fine art.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>very</i> good, Miss Granger!" squeaked Filius Flitwick,
their Charms Professor and Head of Ravenclaw, a tiny little man
with no visible signs of being a past dueling champion. "Excellent!
Stupendous!"</p>
<p>Harry had expected to be, in the worst case, second behind
Hermione. Harry would have preferred for <i>her</i> to be rivalling
<i>him,</i> of course, but he could have accepted it the other way
around.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Harry was headed for the bottom of the class, a
position for which he was companionably rivalling all the other
Muggle-raised students except Hermione. Who was all alone and
rivalless at the top, poor thing.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick was standing over the desk of one of the
other Muggleborns and quietly adjusting the way she was holding her
wand.</p>
<p>Harry looked over at Hermione. He swallowed hard. It was the
obvious role for her in the scheme of things... "Hermione?" Harry
said tentatively. "Do you have any idea what I might be doing
wrong?"</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes lit up with a terrible light of helpfulness and
something in the back of Harry's brain screamed in desperate
humiliation.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Harry's water did seem noticeably cooler
than room temperature and Hermione had given him a few verbal pats
on the head and told him to pronounce it more carefully next time
and gone off to help someone else.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick had given her a House point for helping
him.</p>
<p>Harry was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached and that
wasn't helping his pronunciation.</p>
<p><i>I don't care if it's unfair competition. I know exactly what
I am doing with two extra hours every day. I am going to sit in my
trunk and study until I am keeping up with Hermione
Granger.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic
you will learn at Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There was
no trace of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch.
"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
You have been warned."</p>
<p>Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshaped
itself into a pig. A couple of Muggleborn students gave out small
yelps. The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and
then became a desk again.</p>
<p>The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, and
then her eyes settled on one student.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "You only received your
schoolbooks a few days ago. Have you started reading your
Transfiguration textbook?"</p>
<p>"No, sorry professor," Harry said.</p>
<p>"You needn't apologise, Mr. Potter, if you were required to read
ahead you would have been told to do so." McGonagall's fingers
rapped the desk in front of her. "Mr. Potter, would you care to
guess whether this is a desk which I Transfigured into a pig, or if
it began as a pig and I briefly removed the Transfiguration? If you
had read the first chapter of your textbook, you would know."</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows furrowed slightly. "I'd guess it'd be easier to
start with a pig, since if it started as a desk, it might not know
how to stand up."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "No fault to you, Mr.
Potter, but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do
<i>not</i> care to guess. Wrong answers will be marked with extreme
severity, questions left blank will be marked with great leniency.
You must learn to know what you do not know. If I ask you any
question, no matter how obvious or elementary, and you answer 'I'm
not sure', I will not hold it against you and anyone who laughs
will lose House points. Can you tell me why this rule exists, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p><i>Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly
dangerous.</i> "No."</p>
<p>"Correct. Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition,
which is not taught until your sixth year. Unfortunately,
Transfiguration must be learned and practised at a young age to
maximise your adult ability. So this is a dangerous subject, and
you should be quite scared of making any mistakes, because none of
my students have ever been permanently injured and I will be
<i>extremely put out</i> if you are the first class to <i>spoil my
record</i>."</p>
<p>Several students gulped.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall stood up and moved over to the wall behind
her desk, which held a white wooden board. "There are many reasons
why Transfiguration is dangerous, but one reason stands above all
the rest." She produced a marker seemingly from thin air, and
sketched letters in bright red; which she then underlined, using
the same marker, in blue:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>TRANSFIGURATION IS NOT
PERMANENT!</u></p>
<p>"Transfiguration is not permanent!" said Professor McGonagall.
"Transfiguration is not permanent! Transfiguration is not
permanent! Mr. Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of
wood into a cup of water, and you drank it. What do you imagine
might happen to you when the Transfiguration wore off?" There was a
pause. "Excuse me, I should not have asked that of you, Mr. Potter,
I forgot that you are blessed with an unusually pessimistic
imagination -"</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Harry said, swallowing hard. "So the first answer is
that I don't <i>know</i>," the Professor nodded approvingly, "but I
<i>imagine</i> there might be... wood in my stomach, and in my
bloodstream, and if any of that water had gotten absorbed into my
body's tissues - would it be wood pulp or solid wood or..." Harry's
grasp of magic failed him. He couldn't understand how wood mapped
into water in the first place, so he couldn't understand what would
happen after the water molecules were scrambled by ordinary thermal
motions and the magic wore off and the mapping reversed.</p>
<p>McGonagall's face was stiff. "As Mr. Potter has correctly
reasoned, he would become extremely sick and require immediate
Flooing to St. Mungo's Hospital if he was to have any chance of
survival. Please turn your textbooks to page 5."</p>
<p>Even without any sound in the moving picture, you could tell
that the woman with horribly discolored skin was screaming.</p>
<p>"The criminal who originally Transfigured gold into wine and
gave it to this woman to drink, 'in payment of the debt' as he put
it, received a sentence of ten years in Azkaban. Please turn to
page 6. That is a Dementor. They are the guardians of Azkaban. They
suck away at your magic, your life, and any happy thoughts you try
to have. The picture on page 7 is of the criminal ten years later,
on his release. You will note that he is dead - yes, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>"Professor," Harry said, "if the worst happens in a case like
that, is there any way of <i>maintaining</i> the
Transfiguration?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor McGonagall said flatly. "Sustaining a
Transfiguration is a constant drain on your magic which scales with
the size of the target form. And you would need to recontact the
target every few hours, which is, in a case like this, impossible.
Disasters like this are <i>unrecoverable!</i>"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard. "You
will absolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything
into a liquid or a gas. No water, no air. Nothing like water,
nothing like air. Even if it is not meant to drink. Liquid
<i>evaporates,</i> little bits and pieces of it get into the air.
You will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned. It will
make smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will never
Transfigure anything that could conceivably go inside anyone's body
by any means. No food. Nothing that <i>looks like</i> food. Not
even as a funny little prank where you mean to tell them about your
mud pie before they actually eat it. You will never do it. Period.
Inside this classroom or out of it or <i>anywhere.</i> Is that well
understood by <i>every single student?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry, Hermione, and a few others. The rest seemed
to be speechless.</p>
<p>"<i>Is that well understood by every single student?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes," they said or muttered or whispered.</p>
<p>"If you break any of these rules you will not further study
Transfiguration during your stay at Hogwarts. Repeat along with me.
I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas," said
the students in ragged chorus.</p>
<p>"Again! Louder! I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid
or gas."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or
anything else that goes inside a human body."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything that is to be burned because
it could make smoke."</p>
<p>"You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,
including Muggle money," said Professor McGonagall. "The goblins
have ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law,
the goblin nation is in a permanent state of <i>war</i> with all
magical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send
an army."</p>
<p>"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,"
repeated the students.</p>
<p>"And <i>above all</i>," said Professor McGonagall, "you will not
Transfigure any living subject, <i>especially yourselves.</i> It
will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you
Transfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change."
Professor McGonagall paused. "Mr. Potter is currently holding up
his hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation -
specifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But
an Animagus transformation is not <i>free</i> Transfiguration."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall took a small piece of wood out of her
pocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she
said "<i>Crystferrium!</i>" and the glass ball became a steel
ball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball
became a piece of wood once more. "<i>Crystferrium</i> transforms a
subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid
steel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a
pig. The most general form of Transfiguration - free
Transfiguration, which you will be learning here - is capable of
transforming any subject into any target, at least so far as
physical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration
must be done wordlessly. Using Charms would require different words
for every different transformation between subject and target."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look.
"<i>Some</i> teachers begin with Transfiguration Charms and move on
to free Transfiguration afterwards. Yes, that would be much easier
in the beginning. But it can set you in a poor mold which impairs
your abilities later. Here you will learn free Transfiguration from
the <i>very start</i>, which requires that you cast the spell
wordlessly, by holding the subject form, the target form, and the
transformation within your own mind."</p>
<p>"And to answer Mr. Potter's question," Professor McGonagall went
on, "it is <i>free</i> Transfiguration which you must never do to
any living subject. There are Charms and potions which can safely,
reversibly transform living subjects in <i>limited</i> ways. An
Animagus with a missing limb will still be missing that limb after
transforming, for example. Free Transfiguration is <i>not</i> safe.
Your body will change while it is Transfigured - breathing, for
example, results in a constant loss of the body's stuff to the
surrounding air. When the Transfiguration wears off and your body
tries to revert to its <i>original</i> form, it will not quite be
able to do so. If you press your wand to your body and imagine
yourself with golden hair, afterwards your hair will fall out. If
you visualise yourself as someone with clearer skin, you will be
taking a long stay at St. Mungo's. And if you Transfigure yourself
into an adult bodily form, then, when the Transfiguration wears
off, you will die."</p>
<p>That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls
less than perfectly pretty. Or old people, for that matter. That
wouldn't happen if you could just Transfigure yourself every
morning... Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor
McGonagall with his eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Yes</i>, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target
that is static, such as a coin - no, excuse me, I'm terribly sorry,
let's just say a steel ball."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head. "Mr. Potter, even inanimate
objects undergo small internal changes over time. There would be no
visible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute,
you would notice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick,
and in a day you would be dead."</p>
<p>"Erm, excuse me, so if I'd read the first chapter I could have
<i>guessed</i> that the desk was originally a desk and not a pig,"
Harry said, "but only if I made the <i>further</i> assumption that
you didn't want to kill the pig, that might <i>seem</i> highly
probable but -"</p>
<p>"I can foresee that marking your tests will be an endless source
of delight to me, Mr. Potter. But if you have other questions can I
please ask you to wait until after class?"</p>
<p>"No further questions, professor."</p>
<p>"Now repeat after me," said Professor McGonagall. "I will never
try to Transfigure any living subject, especially myself, unless
specifically instructed to do so using a specialised Charm or
potion."</p>
<p>"If I am not sure whether a Transfiguration is safe, I will not
try it until I have asked Professor McGonagall or Professor
Flitwick or Professor Snape or the Headmaster, who are the only
recognised authorities on Transfiguration at Hogwarts. Asking
another student is <i>not</i> acceptable, even if they say that
they remember asking the same question."</p>
<p>"Even if the current Defence Professor at Hogwarts tells me that
a Transfiguration is safe, and even if I see the Defence Professor
do it and nothing bad seems to happen, I will not try it
myself."</p>
<p>"I have the absolute right to refuse to perform any
Transfiguration about which I feel the slightest bit nervous. Since
not even the Headmaster of Hogwarts can order me to do otherwise, I
certainly will not accept any such order from the Defence
Professor, even if the Defence Professor threatens to deduct one
hundred House points and have me expelled."</p>
<p>"If I break any of these rules I will not further study
Transfiguration during my time at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"We will repeat these rules at the start of every class for the
first month," said Professor McGonagall. "And now, we will begin
with matches as subjects and needles as targets... put away your
wands, thank you, by 'begin' I meant that you will begin taking
notes."</p>
<p>Half an hour before the end of class, Professor McGonagall
handed out the matches.</p>
<p>At the end of the class Hermione had a silvery-looking match and
the entire rest of the class, Muggleborn or otherwise, had exactly
what they'd started with.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall awarded her another point for
Ravenclaw.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>After the Transfiguration class was dismissed, Hermione came
over to Harry's desk as Harry was putting away his books into his
pouch.</p>
<p>"You know," Hermione said with an innocent expression on her
face, "I earned two points for Ravenclaw today."</p>
<p>"So you did," Harry said shortly.</p>
<p>"But that wasn't as good as your <i>seven</i> points," she said.
"I guess I'm just not as intelligent as you."</p>
<p>Harry finished feeding his homework into the pouch and turned to
Hermione with his eyes narrowed. He'd actually forgotten about
that.</p>
<p>She <i>batted her eyelashes</i> at him. "We have lessons every
day, though. I wonder how long it will take you to find some more
Hufflepuffs to rescue? Today is Monday. So that gives you until
Thursday."</p>
<p>The two of them stared into each other's eyes, unblinking.</p>
<p>Harry spoke first. "Of course you realise this means war."</p>
<p>"I didn't know we'd been at peace."</p>
<p>All of the other students were now watching with fascinated
eyes. All of the other students, plus, unfortunately, Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter," sang Professor McGonagall from the other side
of the room, "I have some good news for you. Madam Pomfrey has
approved your suggestion for preventing breakage in her Spimster
wickets, and the plan is to finish the job by the end of next week.
I'd say that deserves... let's call it ten points for
Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>Hermione's face was gaping in betrayal and shock. Harry imagined
his own face didn't look much different.</p>
<p>"<i>Professor...</i>" Harry hissed.</p>
<p>"Those ten points are <i>unquestionably</i> deserved, Mr.
Potter. I would not hand out House points on a whim. To you it
might have been a simple matter of seeing something fragile and
suggesting a way to protect it, but Spimster wickets are expensive,
and the Headmaster was <i>not</i> pleased the last time one broke."
Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful. "My, I wonder if any other
student has ever earned seventeen House points on his first day of
lessons. I'll have to look it up, but I suspect that's a new
record. Perhaps we should have an announcement at dinnertime?"</p>
<p>"<i>PROFESSOR!</i>" Harry shrieked. "This is <i>our</i> war!
Stop meddling!"</p>
<p>"Now you have until Thursday of <i>next</i> week, Mr. Potter.
Unless, of course, you engage in some sort of mischief and
<i>lose</i> House points before then. Addressing a professor
disrespectfully, for example." Professor McGonagall put a finger on
her cheek and looked reflective. "I expect you'll hit negative
numbers before the end of Friday."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth snapped shut. He sent his best Death Glare at
McGonagall but she only seemed to find it amusing.</p>
<p>"Yes, definitely an announcement at dinner," Professor
McGonagall mused. "But it wouldn't do to offend the Slytherins, so
the announcement should be brief. Just the number of points and the
fact of the record... and if anyone comes to you for help with
their schoolwork and is disappointed that you haven't even started
reading your textbooks, you can always refer them to Miss
Granger."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor!</i>" said Hermione in a rather high-pitched
voice.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall ignored her. "My, I wonder how long it will
take before Miss Granger does something deserving of a dinnertime
announcement? I look forward to seeing it, whatever it may be."</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione, by unspoken mutual consent, turned and
stormed out of the classroom. They were followed by a trail of
hypnotised Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "Are we still on for after dinner?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said Hermione. "I wouldn't want you to fall further
behind on your studying."</p>
<p>"Why, thank you. And let me say that as brilliant as you are
already, I can't help but wonder what you'll be like once you have
some elementary training in rationality."</p>
<p>"Is it really that useful? It didn't seem to help you with
Charms or Transfiguration."</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Well, I only got my schoolbooks four days ago. That's why I had
to earn those seventeen House points without using my wand."</p>
<p>"Four days ago? Maybe you can't read eight books in four days
but you might have at least read <i>one</i>. How many days will it
take to finish at that rate? You know all that mathematics, so can
you tell me what's eight, times four, divided by zero?"</p>
<p>"I've got classes now, which you didn't, but weekends are free,
so... limit of eight times four divided by epsilon as epsilon
approaches zero plus... 10:47AM on Sunday."</p>
<p>"I did it in <i>three</i> days actually."</p>
<p>"2:47PM on Saturday it is, then. I'm sure I'll find the time
somewhere."</p>
<p>And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="16">Chapter 16</h2><h3>Lateral Thinking</h3>
<p>The enemy's gate is Rowling.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As soon as he walked into the Defence classroom on Wednesday,
Harry knew that <i>this</i> subject was going to be
<i>different</i>.</p>
<p>It was, for a start, the largest classroom he had yet seen at
Hogwarts, akin to a major university classroom, with layered tiers
of desks facing a gigantic flat stage of white marble. The
classroom was high up in the castle - on the fifth floor - and
Harry knew that was as much explanation as he'd get for where a
room like this was supposed to fit. It was becoming clear that
Hogwarts simply did not <i>have</i> a geometry, Euclidean or
otherwise; it had connections, not directions.</p>
<p>Unlike a university hall, there weren't rows of folding seats;
instead there were quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks and wooden
chairs, lined up in a curve across each level of the classroom.
Except that each desk had a flat, white, rectangular, mysterious
object propped up on it.</p>
<p>In the center of the gigantic platform, on a small raised dais
of darker marble, was a lone teacher's desk. At which Quirrell sat
slumped over in his chair, head lolled back, drooling slightly over
his robes.</p>
<p><i>Now what does that remind me of...?</i></p>
<p>Harry had arrived at the lesson so early that no other students
were there yet. (The English language was defective when it came to
describing time travel; in particular, English lacked any words
capable of expressing how convenient it was.) Quirrell didn't seem
to be... functional... at the moment, and Harry didn't particularly
feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.</p>
<p>Harry selected a desk, climbed up to it, sat down, and retrieved
the Defence textbook. He was around seven-eighths of the way
through - he'd planned on finishing the book before this lesson,
actually, but he was running behind schedule and had already used
the Time-Turner twice today.</p>
<p>Soon there were sounds as the classroom began to fill up. Harry
ignored them.</p>
<p>"Potter? What are <i>you</i> doing here?"</p>
<p><i>That</i> voice didn't belong here. Harry looked up. "Draco?
What are <i>you</i> doing in oh my god you have
<i>minions</i>."</p>
<p>One of the lads standing behind Draco seemed to have rather a
lot of muscle for an eleven-year-old, and the other was poised in a
suspiciously balanced-looking stance.</p>
<p>The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly and gestured
behind him. "Potter, I introduce to you Mr. Crabbe," his hand moved
from Muscles to Balance, "Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, this is
Harry Potter."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle tilted his head and gave Harry a look that was
probably supposed to mean something but ended up just looking
squinty. Mr. Crabbe said "Please to meetcha" in a tone that sounded
like he was trying to lower his voice as far as it could go.</p>
<p>A fleeting expression of consternation crossed Draco's face, but
was quickly replaced by his superior grin.</p>
<p>"You have <i>minions!</i>" Harry repeated. "Where do <i>I</i>
get minions?"</p>
<p>Draco's smirk grew wider. "I'm afraid, Potter, that the first
step is to be Sorted into Slytherin -"</p>
<p>"What? That's not fair!"</p>
<p>"- and then for your families to have an arrangement from before
you were born."</p>
<p>Harry looked at Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. They both seemed to be
trying very hard to loom. That is, they were leaning forwards,
hunching over their shoulders, sticking their necks out and staring
at him.</p>
<p>"Um... hold on," said Harry. "This was arranged <i>years</i>
ago?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, Potter. I'm afraid you're out of luck."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle produced a toothpick and began cleaning his teeth,
still looming.</p>
<p>"And," said Harry, "Lucius insisted that you were <i>not</i> to
grow up knowing your bodyguards, and that you were only to meet
them on your first day of school."</p>
<p>That wiped the grin from Draco's face. "Yes, Potter, we all know
you're brilliant, the whole school knows by now, you can stop
showing off -"</p>
<p>"So they've been told their <i>whole lives</i> that they're
going to be your minions and they've spent <i>years</i> imagining
what minions are supposed to be like -"</p>
<p>Draco winced.</p>
<p>"- and what's worse, they <i>do</i> know <i>each other</i> and
they've been <i>practising</i> -"</p>
<p>"The boss told ya to shut it," rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit
down on his toothpick, holding it between his teeth, and used one
hand to crack the knuckles on the other.</p>
<p><i>"I told you not to do this in front of Harry Potter!"</i></p>
<p>The two looked a bit sheepish and Mr. Goyle quickly put the
toothpick back in a pocket of his robes.</p>
<p>But the moment Draco turned away from them to face Harry again,
they went back to looming.</p>
<p>"I apologise," Draco said stiffly, "for the insult which these
<i>imbeciles</i> have offered you."</p>
<p>Harry gave a meaningful look to Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. "I'd
say you're being a little harsh on them, Draco. <i>I</i> think
they're acting exactly the way I'd want <i>my</i> minions to act. I
mean, if I had any minions."</p>
<p>Draco's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Hey, Gregory, you don' think he's tryna lure us away from the
boss, do ya?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure Mr. Potter wouldn't be that foolish."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't dream of it," Harry said smoothly. "It's just
something to keep in mind if your current employer seems
unappreciative. Besides, it never hurts to have other offers while
you're negotiating your working conditions, right?"</p>
<p>"What's <i>he</i> doin' in Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>"I can't imagine, Mr. Crabbe."</p>
<p>"Both of you <i>shut up</i>," Draco said through gritted teeth.
"That's an <i>order</i>." With a visible effort, he transferred his
attention to Harry again. "Anyway, what're you doing in the
Slytherin Defence class?"</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Hold on." His hand went into his pouch.
"Timetable." He looked over the parchment. "Defence, 2:30pm, and
right now it's..." Harry looked at his mechanical watch, which read
11:23. "2:23, unless I've lost track of time. Did I?" If he had,
well, Harry knew how to get to whatever lesson he was
<i>supposed</i> to be at. God he loved his Time-Turner and someday,
when he was old enough, they would get married.</p>
<p>"No, that sounds right," Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze
turned to look over the rest of the auditorium, which was filling
with green-trimmed robes and...</p>
<p>"<i>Gryffindorks!</i>" spat Draco. "What're <i>they</i> doing
here?"</p>
<p>"Hm," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell did say... I forget his
exact words... that he would be ignoring some of the Hogwarts
teaching conventions. Maybe he just combined all his classes."</p>
<p>"Huh," said Draco. "You're the first Ravenclaw in here."</p>
<p>"Yup. Got here early."</p>
<p>"What're you doing all the way in the back row, then?"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "I dunno, seemed like a good place to sit?"</p>
<p>Draco made a scoffing sound. "You couldn't get any further away
from the teacher if you tried." The blonde-haired boy leaned
slightly closer. "Anyway, is it true about what you said to Derrick
and his crew?"</p>
<p>"Who's Derrick?"</p>
<p>"You hit him with a pie?"</p>
<p>"Two pies, actually. What am I supposed to have said to
him?"</p>
<p>"That he wasn't doing anything cunning or ambitious and he was a
disgrace to Salazar Slytherin." Draco was staring intently at
Harry.</p>
<p>"That... sounds about right," Harry said. "I think it was more
like, 'is this some kind of incredibly clever plot that will gain
you a future advantage or is it really as much of a disgrace to the
memory of Salazar Slytherin as it looks like' or something like
that. I don't remember the exact words."</p>
<p>"You're confusing everyone, you know," said the blonde-haired
boy.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Harry said in honest confusion.</p>
<p>"Warrington said that spending a long time under the Sorting Hat
is one of the warning signs of a major Dark Wizard. Everyone was
talking about it, wondering if they should start sucking up to you
just in case. Then you went and protected a bunch of
<i>Hufflepuffs,</i> for Merlin's sake. <i>Then</i> you told Derrick
he's a disgrace to Salazar Slytherin's memory! What's anyone
<i>supposed</i> to think?"</p>
<p>"That the Sorting Hat decided to put me in the House of
'Slytherin! Just kidding! Ravenclaw!' and I've been acting
accordingly."</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both giggled, causing Mr. Goyle to
quickly clap a hand to his mouth.</p>
<p>"We'd better go get our seats," Draco said. He hesitated,
straightened a bit, spoke a bit more fomally. "But I do want to
continue our last conversation and I accept your conditions."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Would you mind terribly if I waited until
Saturday afternoon? I'm in a bit of a contest right now."</p>
<p>"A contest?"</p>
<p>"See if I can read all my textbooks as fast as Hermione Granger
did."</p>
<p>"Granger," Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. "The mudblood who
thinks she's Merlin? If you're trying to show <i>her</i> up then
all Slytherin wishes you the <i>very</i> best luck, Potter, and I
won't bother you 'til Saturday." Draco inclined his head
respectfully, and wandered off, tailed by his minions.</p>
<p><i>Oh, this is going to be</i> so <i>much fun to juggle, I can
already tell.</i></p>
<p>The classroom was filling up rapidly now with all four colors of
trim: green, red, yellow, and blue. Draco and his two friends
seemed to be in the midst of trying to acquire three contiguous
front-row seats - already occupied, of course. Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle were looming vigorously, but it didn't seem to be having much
effect.</p>
<p>Harry bent over his Defence textbook and continued reading.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>At 2:35PM, when most of the seats were taken and no one else
seemed to be coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in
his chair and sat up straight, and his face appeared on all the
flat, white rectangular objects that were propped up on the
students' desks.</p>
<p>Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of
Professor Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle
television. There was something both nostalgic and sad about that,
it seemed so much like a piece of home and yet it wasn't
really...</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, my young apprentices," said Professor Quirrell.
His voice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking
directly to Harry. "Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic,
as the founders of Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to
be called in the late twentieth century, Defence Against the Dark
Arts."</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students,
taken by surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks.</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said. "Don't bother writing down what
this subject was once called. No such pointless question will count
toward your marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise."</p>
<p>Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather
shocked.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly. "Those of you who have
wasted time by reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks
-"</p>
<p>Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was
Hermione.</p>
<p>"- may have gotten the impression that although this subject is
called Defence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to
defend against Nightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad
dreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve all the way through a
two-inch wooden beam given most of a day."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the
desk. The screen on Harry's desk followed his every move. Professor
Quirrell strode towards the front of the classroom, and
bellowed:</p>
<p>"The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes
fire so quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in
midflight! One Killing Curse will bring it down!"</p>
<p>There were gasps from the students.</p>
<p>"The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian
Horntail! It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is
resistant enough to withstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms!
Its sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from afar whether
its prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome
of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously
maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is always
transforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping
off its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire and acid will
produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll's
regenerative powers - for an hour or two! They are smart enough to
use clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect
killing machine in all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it
down."</p>
<p>The students were looking rather shocked.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. "Your sad excuse
for a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you
expose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in
place. This, my young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge
you will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter mountain
trolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to
stop them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show
off their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality. Just
because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with
mountain trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it!
The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every
single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you
find yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can
simply Apparate away! Likewise if you are facing the second most
perfect killing machine, a Dementor. You just Apparate away!"</p>
<p>"Unless, of course," Professor Quirrell said, his voice now
lower and harder, "you are under the influence of an
anti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly one monster which can
threaten you once you are fully grown. The single most dangerous
monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes
close. The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing that will still be
able to threaten you."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips were set in a thin line. "I will
reluctantly teach you enough trivia for a passing mark on the
Ministry-mandated portions of your first-year finals. Since your
exact mark on these sections will make no difference to your future
life, anyone who wants more than a passing mark is welcome to waste
their own time studying our pathetic excuse for a textbook. The
title of this subject is not Defence Against Minor Pests. You are
here to learn how to defend yourselves against the Dark Arts. Which
means, let us be very clear on this, defending yourselves against
Dark Wizards. People with wands who want to hurt you and who will
likely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them first! There is no
defence without offence! There is no defence without fighting! This
reality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat,
overpaid, Auror-guarded politicians who mandated your curriculum.
To the abyss with those fools! You are here for the subject that
has been taught at Hogwarts for eight hundred years! Welcome to
your first year of Battle Magic!"</p>
<p>Harry started applauding. He couldn't help himself, it was too
inspiring.</p>
<p>Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response
from Gryffindor, and more from Slytherin, but most students simply
seemed too stunned to react.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause died
instantly. "Thank you very much," said Professor Quirrell. "Now to
practicalities. I have combined all my first-year Battle classes
into one, which allows me to offer you twice as much classroom time
as Doubles sessions -"</p>
<p>There were gasps of horror.</p>
<p>"- an increased load which I will make up to you by not
assigning any homework."</p>
<p>The gasps of horror cut off abruptly.</p>
<p>"Yes, you heard me correctly. I will teach you to fight, not to
write twelve inches on fighting due Monday."</p>
<p>Harry desperately wished he'd sat next to Hermione so he could
see the look on her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty
sure he was imagining it accurately.</p>
<p>Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him,
the Time-Turner, and Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some
after-school activities that I think you will find quite
interesting as well as educational. Do you want to show the world
your <i>own</i> abilities instead of watching fourteen other people
play Quidditch? More than seven people can fight in an army."</p>
<p>Hot <i>damn.</i></p>
<p>"These and other after-school activities will also earn you
Quirrell points. What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point
system does not suit my needs, because it makes House points too
rare. I prefer to let my students know how they are doing more
frequently than that. And on the rare occasions I offer you a
written test, it will mark itself as you go along, and if you get
too many related questions wrong, your test will show the names of
students who got those questions right, and those students will be
able to earn Quirrell points by helping you."</p>
<p>...wow. Why didn't the other professors use a system like
that?</p>
<p>"What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten
Quirrell points will be worth one House point. But they will earn
you other favors as well. Would you like to take your exam at an
unusual time? Is there a particular session you would very much
prefer to skip? You will find that I can be very flexible on behalf
of students who have accumulated enough Quirrell points. Quirrell
points will control the generalship of the armies. And for
Christmas - just before the Christmas break - I will grant someone
a wish. Any school-related feat that lies within my power, my
influence, or above all, my ingenuity. Yes, I was in Slytherin and
I am offering to formulate a cunning plot on your behalf, if that
is what it takes to accomplish your desire. This wish will go to
whoever has earned the most Quirrell points within all seven
years."</p>
<p>That would be Harry.</p>
<p>"Now leave your books and loose items at your desks - they will
be safe, the screens will watch over them for you - and come down
onto this platform. It's time to play a game called Who's the Most
Dangerous Student in the Classroom."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry twisted his wand in his right hand and said
"<i>Ma-ha-su!</i>"</p>
<p>There was another high-pitched "bing" from the floating blue
sphere that Professor Quirrell had assigned to Harry as his target.
That particular sound meant a perfect strike, which Harry had been
gotten on nine out of his last ten attempts.</p>
<p>Somewhere Professor Quirrell had dug up a spell that was
incredibly easy to pronounce, <i>and</i> had a ridiculously simple
wand motion, <i>and</i> had a tendency to hit wherever you were
currently looking at. Professor Quirrell had disdainfully
proclaimed that real battle magic was far more difficult than this.
That the hex was entirely useless in actual combat. That it was a
barely ordered burst of magic whose only real content was the
aiming, and that it would produce, when it hit, a pain briefly
equivalent to being punched hard in the nose. That the sole purpose
of this test was to see who was a fast learner, since Professor
Quirrell was certain no one would have previously encountered this
hex or anything like it.</p>
<p>Harry didn't care about any of that.</p>
<p>"<i>Ma-ha-su!</i>"</p>
<p>A <i>red bolt of energy</i> shot out of his wand and struck the
target and the blue sphere once again made the bing which meant the
spell had <i>actually worked for him.</i></p>
<p>Harry was feeling like a real wizard for the first time since
he'd come to Hogwarts. He wished the target would dodge like the
little spheres that Ben Kenobi had used for training Luke, but for
some reason Professor Quirrell had instead lined up all the
students and targets in neat orders which made sure they wouldn't
fire on each other.</p>
<p>So Harry lowered his wand, skipped to the right, snapped up his
wand and twisted and shouted "<i>Ma-ha-su!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a lower-pitched "dong" which meant he'd gotten it
almost right.</p>
<p>Harry put his wand into his pocket, skipped back to the left and
drew and fired another red bolt of energy.</p>
<p>The high-pitched bing which resulted was easily one of the most
satisfying sounds he'd heard in his life. Harry wanted to scream in
triumph at the top of his lungs. <i>I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS
OF PHYSICS, I'M COMING TO VIOLATE YOU!</i></p>
<p>"<i>Ma-ha-su!</i>" Harry's voice was loud, but hardly
noticeable over the steady chant of similar cries from around the
classroom platform.</p>
<p>"Enough," said Professor Quirrell's amplified voice. (It didn't
sound loud. It sounded like normal volume, coming from just behind
your left shoulder, no matter where you were standing relative to
Professor Quirrell.) "I see that all of you have succeeded at least
once now." The target-spheres turned red and began to drift up
towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was standing on the raised dais in the center
of the platform, leaning slightly on his teacher's desk with one
hand.</p>
<p>"I told you," Professor Quirrell said, "that we would play a
game called Who's the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom.
There is one student in this classroom who mastered the Sumerian
Simple Strike Hex faster than anyone else -"</p>
<p>Oh blah blah blah.</p>
<p>"- and went on to help seven other students. For which she has
earned the first seven Quirrell points awarded to your year. Come
forth, Hermione Granger. It is time for the next stage of the
game."</p>
<p>Hermione Granger began striding forwards, a mixed look of
triumph and apprehension on her face. The Ravenclaws looked on
proudly, the Slytherins with glares, and Harry with frank
annoyance. Harry had done fine this time. He was probably even in
the upper half of the class, now that everyone had been faced with
an equally unfamiliar spell and Harry had read all the way through
Adalbert Waffling's <i>Magical Theory</i>. And yet <i>Hermione was
still doing better</i>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind was the fear that Hermione was
simply smarter than him.</p>
<p>But for now Harry was going to pin his hopes on the known facts
that (a) Hermione had read a lot more than the standard textbooks
and (b) Adalbert Waffling was an uninspired sod who'd written
<i>Magical Theory</i> to pander to a school board that didn't think
much of eleven-year-olds.</p>
<p>Hermione reached the central dais and stepped up.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger mastered a completely unfamiliar spell in two
minutes, almost a full minute faster than the next runner-up."
Professor Quirrell turned slowly in place to look at all the
students watching them. "Could Miss Granger's intelligence make her
the most dangerous student in the classroom? Well? What do you
think?"</p>
<p>No one seemed to be thinking anything at the moment. Even Harry
wasn't sure what to say.</p>
<p>"Let's find out, shall we?" said Professor Quirrell. He turned
back to Hermione, and gestured toward the wider class. "Select any
student you like and cast the Simple Strike Hex on them."</p>
<p>Hermione froze where she stood.</p>
<p>"Come now," Professor Quirrell said smoothly. "You have cast
this spell perfectly over fifty times. It is not permanently
harmful or even all that painful. It hurts as much as a hard punch
and lasts only a few seconds." Professor Quirrell's voice grew
harder. "This is a direct order from your professor, Miss Granger.
Choose a target and fire a Simple Strike Hex."</p>
<p>Hermione's face was screwed up in horror and her wand was
trembling in her hand. Harry's own fingers were clenching his own
wand hard in sympathy. Even though he could see what Professor
Quirrell was trying to do. Even though he could see the point
Professor Quirrell was trying to make.</p>
<p>"If you do <i>not</i> raise your wand and fire, Miss Granger,
you will lose a Quirrell point."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Hermione, willing her to look in his direction.
His right hand was softly tapping his own chest. <i>Pick me, I'm
not afraid...</i></p>
<p>Hermione's wand twitched in her hand; then her face relaxed, and
she lowered her wand to her side.</p>
<p>"No," said Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>Her voice was calm, and even though it wasn't loud, everyone
heard it in the silence.</p>
<p>"Then I must deduct one point from you," said Professor
Quirrell. "This is a test, and you have failed it."</p>
<p>That reached her. Harry could see it. But she kept her shoulders
straight.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice was sympathetic and seemed to fill
the whole room. "Knowing things isn't always enough, Miss Granger.
If you cannot give and receive violence on the order of stubbing
your toe, then you cannot defend yourself and you will not pass
Defence. Please rejoin your classmates."</p>
<p>Hermione walked back towards the Ravenclaw cluster. Her face
looked peaceful and Harry, for some odd reason, wanted to start
clapping. Even though Professor Quirrell had been <i>right</i>.</p>
<p>"So," Professor Quirrell said. "It becomes clear that Hermione
Granger is not the most dangerous student in the classroom. Who do
you think might actually be the most dangerous person here? -
besides me, of course."</p>
<p>Without even thinking, Harry turned to look at the Slytherin
contingent.</p>
<p>"Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said
Professor Quirrell. "It seems that many of your fellow pupils are
looking in your direction. Come forth, if you would."</p>
<p>Draco did so, walking with a certain pride in his bearing. He
stepped onto the dais and looked up at Professor Quirrell with a
smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," Professor Quirrell said. "Fire."</p>
<p>Harry would have tried to stop it if there'd been time but in
one smooth motion Draco spun on the Ravenclaw contingent and raised
his wand and said "<i>Mahasu!</i>" like it was all one syllable
and Hermione was saying "Ow!" and that was that.</p>
<p>"Well struck," said Professor Quirrell. "Two Quirrell points to
you. But tell me, why did you target Miss Granger?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Finally Draco said, "Because she stood out the most."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's lips turned up in a thin smile. "And that
is the true reason why Draco Malfoy is dangerous. Had he selected
any other, that child would more likely resent being singled out,
and Mr. Malfoy would more probably make an enemy. And while Mr.
Malfoy might have given some other justification for selecting her,
that would have served him no purpose save to alienate some of you,
while others are already cheering him whether he says anything or
not. Which is to say that Mr. Malfoy is dangerous because he knows
who to strike and who not to strike, how to make allies and avoid
making enemies. Two more Quirrell points to you, Mr. Malfoy. And as
you have demonstrated an exemplary virtue of Slytherin, I think
that Salazar's House has earned a point as well. You may rejoin
your friends."</p>
<p>Draco bowed slightly and walked back to the Slytherin
contingent. Some clapping started from the green-trimmed robes, but
Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture and silence fell
again.</p>
<p>"It might seem that our game is done," said Professor Quirrell.
"And yet there is a single student in this classroom who is more
dangerous than the scion of Malfoy."</p>
<p>And <i>now</i> for some reason there seemed to be an awful lot
of people looking at...</p>
<p>"Harry Potter. Come forth."</p>
<p>This did not bode well.</p>
<p>Harry reluctantly walked towards where Professor Quirrell stood
on his raised dais, still leaning slightly against his teacher's
desk.</p>
<p>The nervousness of being put into the spotlight seemed to be
sharpening Harry's wits as he approached the dais, and his mind was
ruffling through possibilities for what Professor Quirrell might
think could demonstrate Harry's dangerousness. Would he be asked to
cast a spell? To defeat a Dark Lord?</p>
<p>Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely
Professor Quirrell was too smart for <i>that</i>...</p>
<p>Harry stopped well short of the dais, and Professor Quirrell
didn't ask him to come any closer.</p>
<p>"The irony is," said Professor Quirrell, "you all looked at the
right person for entirely the wrong reasons. You are thinking,"
Professor Quirrell's lips twisted, "that Harry Potter has defeated
the Dark Lord, and so must be very dangerous. Bah. He was one year
old. Whatever quirk of fate killed the Dark Lord likely had little
to do with Mr. Potter's abilities as a fighter. But after I heard
rumors of one Ravenclaw facing down five older Slytherins, I
interviewed several eyewitnesses and came to the conclusion that
Harry Potter would be my most dangerous student."</p>
<p>A jolt of adrenaline poured into Harry's system, making him
stand up straighter. He didn't know what conclusion Professor
Quirrell had come to, but that couldn't be good.</p>
<p>"Ah, Professor Quirrell -" Harry started to say.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked amused. "You're thinking that I've
come up with a wrong answer, aren't you, Mr. Potter? You will learn
to expect better of <i>me</i>." Professor Quirrell straightened
from where he had leaned on the desk. "Mr. Potter, all things have
their accustomed uses. Give me ten unaccustomed uses of objects in
this room for combat!"</p>
<p>For a moment Harry was rendered speechless by the sheer, raw
shock of having been understood.</p>
<p>And then the ideas started to pour out.</p>
<p>"There are desks which are heavy enough to be fatal if dropped
from a great height. There are chairs with metal legs that could
impale someone if driven hard enough. The air in this classroom
would be deadly by its absence, since people die in vacuum, and it
can serve as a carrier for poison gases."</p>
<p>Harry had to stop briefly for breath, and into that pause
Professor Quirrell said:</p>
<p>"That's three. You need ten. The rest of the class thinks that
you've already used up the whole contents of the classroom."</p>
<p>"<i>Ha!</i> The floor can be removed to create a spike pit to
fall into, the ceiling can be collapsed on someone, the walls can
serve as raw material for Transfiguration into any number of deadly
things - knives, say."</p>
<p>"That's six. But surely you're scraping the bottom of the barrel
now?"</p>
<p>"I haven't even started! Just look at all the people! Having a
Gryffindor attack the enemy is an <i>ordinary</i> use, of course
-"</p>
<p>"I will not count that one."</p>
<p>"- but their blood can also be used to drown someone. Ravenclaws
are known for their brains, but their internal organs could be sold
on the black market for enough money to hire an assassin.
Slytherins aren't just useful as assassins, they can also be thrown
at sufficient velocity to crush an enemy. And Hufflepuffs, in
addition to being hard workers, also contain bones that can be
removed, sharpened, and used to stab someone."</p>
<p>By now the rest of the class was staring at Harry in some
horror. Even the Slytherins looked shocked.</p>
<p>"That's ten, though I'm being generous in counting the Ravenclaw
one. Now, for extra credit, one Quirrell point for each use of
objects in this room which you have not yet named." Professor
Quirrell favored Harry with a companionable smile. "The rest of
your class thinks you are in trouble now, since you've named
everything except the targets and you have no idea what may be done
with those."</p>
<p>"Bah! I've named all the people, but not my robes, which can be
used to suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough
times, or Hermione Granger's robes, which can be torn into strips
and tied into a rope and used to hang someone, or Draco Malfoy's
robes, which can be used to start a fire -"</p>
<p>"Three points," said Professor Quirrell, "no more clothing
now."</p>
<p>"My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye
socket" and someone made a horrified, strangling sound.</p>
<p>"Four points, no more wands."</p>
<p>"My wristwatch could suffocate someone if jammed down their
throat -"</p>
<p>"Five points, and enough."</p>
<p>"Hmph," Harry said. "Ten Quirrell points to one House point,
right? You should have let me keep going until I'd won the House
Cup, I haven't even started yet on the unaccustomed uses of
everything I've got in my pockets" or the mokeskin pouch itself and
he couldn't talk about the Time-Turner or the invisibility cloak
but there had to be <i>something</i> he could say about those red
spheres...</p>
<p>"<i>Enough,</i> Mr. Potter. Well, do you all think you
understand what makes Mr. Potter the most dangerous student in the
classroom?"</p>
<p>There was a low murmur of assent.</p>
<p>"Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate
dangerous?"</p>
<p>"Ah... um... he's creative?"</p>
<p>"<i>Wrong!</i>" bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist came
down sharply on his desk with an amplified sound that made everyone
jump. "All of Mr. Potter's ideas were worse than useless!"</p>
<p>Harry started in surprise.</p>
<p>"Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat
you do not have that sort of preparation time and if you did there
would be a hundred better uses! Transfigure material from the
walls? Mr. Potter cannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had
exactly one idea which he could use immediately, right now, without
extensive preparation or a cooperative enemy or magic he does not
know. That idea was to jam his wand through his enemy's eye socket.
Which would be more likely to break his wand than kill his
opponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I'm afraid that your proposals were
uniformly awful."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said indignantly. "You <i>asked</i> for unusual
ideas, not practical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How
would <i>you</i> use something in this classroom to kill
someone?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was disapproving, but there were
smile crinkles around his eyes. "Mr. Potter, I never said you were
to <i>kill.</i> There is a time and a place for taking your enemy
alive, and inside a Hogwarts classroom is usually one of those
places. But to answer your question, hit them on the neck with the
edge of a chair."</p>
<p>There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were
laughing with Harry, not at him.</p>
<p>Everyone else was looking rather horrified.</p>
<p>"But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most
dangerous student in the classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses
of items in this room for combat. Mr. Potter could have suggested
using a desk to block a curse, or using a chair to trip an oncoming
enemy, or wrapping cloth around his arm to create an improvised
shield. Instead, every single use that Mr. Potter named was
offensive rather than defensive, and either fatal or potentially
fatal."</p>
<p>What? Wait, that couldn't be true... Harry had a sudden sense of
vertigo as he tried to remember what exactly he'd suggested, surely
there had to be a counterexample...</p>
<p>"And that," Professor Quirrell said, "is why Mr. Potter's ideas
were so strange and useless - because he had to reach far into the
impractical in order to meet his standard of <i>killing the
enemy.</i> To him, any idea which fell short of that was not worth
considering. This reflects a quality that we might call <i>intent
to kill</i>. I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is how he could
stare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it,
not yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary
murder, but even he was shocked - yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was
watching your face - when Mr. Potter described how to use his
classmates' bodies as raw material. There are censors inside your
mind which make you flinch away from thoughts like that. Mr. Potter
thinks <i>purely</i> of killing the enemy, he will grasp at any
means to do so, he does not flinch, his censors are off. Even
though his youthful genius is so undisciplined and impractical as
to be useless, his <i>intent to kill</i> makes Harry Potter the
Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom. One final point to him -
no, let us make that a point to Ravenclaw - for this indispensable
requisite of a true fighting wizard."</p>
<p>Harry's mouth gaped open in speechless shock as he searched
frantically for something to say to this. <i>That is so completely
not what I am about!</i></p>
<p>But he could see that the other students were starting to
believe it. Harry's mind was flipping through possible denials and
not finding anything that could stand up against the authoritative
voice of Professor Quirrell. The best Harry had come up with was
"I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative" and that sounded
kind of ominous. He needed to say something unexpected, something
that would make people stop and reconsider -</p>
<p>"And now," Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter. Fire."</p>
<p>Nothing happened, of course.</p>
<p>"Ah, well," said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. "I suppose we
must all start somewhere. Mr. Potter, select any student you please
for a Simple Strike Hex. You <i>will</i> do so before I dismiss
your class for the day. If you do not, I will begin deducting House
points, and I will keep on deducting them until you do."</p>
<p>Harry carefully raised his wand. He had to do that much, or
Professor Quirrell might start deducting House points right
away.</p>
<p>Slowly, as though on a roasting platter, Harry turned to face
the Slytherins.</p>
<p>And Harry's eyes met Draco's.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy didn't look the slightest bit afraid. The
blonde-haired boy wasn't giving any visible sign of assent such as
Harry had given Hermione, but then he could hardly be expected to
do so. The other Slytherins would think that rather odd.</p>
<p>"Why the hesitation?" said Professor Quirrell. "Surely there's
only one obvious choice."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "Only one <i>obvious</i> choice."</p>
<p>Harry twisted the wand and said "<i>Ma-ha-su!</i>"</p>
<p>There was complete silence in the classroom.</p>
<p>Harry shook his left arm, trying to get rid of the lingering
sting.</p>
<p>There was more silence.</p>
<p>Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. "Yes, quite ingenious, but
there was a lesson to be taught and you dodged it. One point from
Ravenclaw for showing off your own cleverness at the expense of the
actual goal. Class dismissed."</p>
<p>And before anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:</p>
<p>"Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>There was silence for a brief moment after that, a sound of
people thinking, and then the murmurs started and rapidly rose to a
roar of conversation.</p>
<p>Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, the two of them needed
to talk -</p>
<p>Quirrell had slumped over and was trudging back to his
chair.</p>
<p>No. Not acceptable. They <i>really</i> needed to talk. Stuff the
zombie act, Professor Quirrell would probably wake up if Harry
poked him a couple of times. Harry started forward -</p>
<p><i>WRONG<br />
DON'T<br />
BAD IDEA</i></p>
<p>Harry swayed and stopped in his tracks, feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>And then a flock of Ravenclaws descended on him and the
discussions began.</p>

<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be specific, 7:24am on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his
motionless hands.</p>
<p>Harry had just had an idea for a <i>truly brilliant</i>
experimental test.</p>
<p>It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was
why he had cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to
be tested right away, immediately, now.</p>
<p>Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his
bed, yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs,
and started moving boxes of books around. (He really needed to
unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of
his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he
hadn't had time.)</p>
<p>Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.</p>
<p>The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the
Great Hall and start the day.</p>
<p>"Excuse me can you do something for me?" said Harry. He was
flipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with
the first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the
book at Anthony Goldstein. "Pick two three-digit numbers from this
list. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them together and
tell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to
double-check? Please make really sure you've got the right answer,
I'm not sure what's going to happen to me or the universe if you
make a multiplication error."</p>
<p>It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over
the past few days that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything
like "Why'd you suddenly flip out?" or "That seems really weird,
what are your reasons for asking?" or "What do you mean, you're not
sure what's going to happen to the universe?"</p>
<p>Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment
and quill. Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to
see anything, dancing back and forth and bouncing up and down with
impatience. He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got
ready to write.</p>
<p>"Okay," Anthony said, "One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four
hundred and twenty-nine."</p>
<p>Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he'd just written
down, and Anthony confirmed it.</p>
<p>Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk,
glanced at his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and
then shut his eyes.</p>
<p>Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps,
followed by the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding
shut. (Harry wasn't worried about suffocating. An automatic
Air-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you were willing
to buy a really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have
to worry about electric bills.)</p>
<p>And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been
hoping to see, a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift
of his future self.</p>
<p>Call that piece of paper "Paper-2".</p>
<p>Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad.</p>
<p>Call that "Paper-1". It was, of course, the same piece of paper.
You could even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges
matched.</p>
<p>Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would
follow.</p>
<p>If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write
"101 x 101" down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back
in time, drop off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and
head on up out of the cavern level to join his dorm mates for
breakfast.</p>
<p>If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it,
Harry would multiply those numbers together.</p>
<p>If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those
two numbers on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time.</p>
<p>Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write
down the new pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the
number on the right greater than 997, in which case Harry would add
2 to the number on the left and write down 101 on the right.</p>
<p>And if Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1
blank.</p>
<p>Which meant that the only possible <i>stable</i> time loop was
the one in which Paper-2 contained the two prime factors of
181,429.</p>
<p>If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer
that was easy to check but hard to find. He wouldn't have
<i>just</i> shown that P=NP once you had a Time-Turner, this trick
was <i>more general</i> than that. Harry could use it to find the
combinations on combination locks, or passwords of every sort.
Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets, if
Harry could figure out some systematic way of describing all the
locations in Hogwarts. It would be an awesome cheat even by Harry's
standards of cheating.</p>
<p>Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it.</p>
<p>Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting:</p>
<p>DO NOT MESS WITH TIME</p>
<p>Harry wrote down "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" on Paper-1 in slightly
shaky handwriting, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any
more truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least
fifteen years old.</p>
<p>To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest
experimental result in the entire history of science.</p>
<p>It had been somewhat difficult for Harry to focus on reading his
textbook for the next hour.</p>
<p>That was how Harry's Thursday started.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be specific, 3:32pm on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a
grassy field with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply
of broomsticks. The girls would be learning to fly separately.
Apparently, for some reason, girls didn't want to learn how to fly
on broomsticks in the presence of boys.</p>
<p>Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn't
seem to stop wondering how that <i>particular</i> stable time loop
had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather large
space of possibilities.</p>
<p>Also: seriously, <i>broomsticks?</i> He was going to fly on,
basically, a line segment? Wasn't that pretty much the single most
unstable shape you could possibly find, short of attempting to hold
on to a point marble? Who'd selected <i>that</i> design for a
flying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry had been hoping
that it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were standing in
front of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen
broomsticks. Had someone just gotten stuck on the idea of
broomsticks and failed to consider anything else? It had to be.
There was no way that the <i>optimal</i> designs for cleaning
kitchens and flying would happen to coincide if you worked them out
from scratch.</p>
<p>It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun
that was just begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to
see, if you were trying to fly around the sky. The ground was nice
and dry, smelling positively baked, and somehow felt very, very
hard under Harry's shoes.</p>
<p>Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominator
of eleven-year-olds was expected to learn this and it couldn't be
that hard.</p>
<p>"Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if
you're left-handed," called Madam Hooch. "And say, UP!"</p>
<p>"UP!" everyone shouted.</p>
<p>The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry's hand.</p>
<p>Which put him at the head of the class, for once. Apparently
saying "UP!" was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most of
the broomsticks were rolling around on the ground or trying to inch
away from their would-be riders.</p>
<p>(Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done at
least as well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day.
There couldn't possibly be anything <i>he</i> could master on the
first try which would baffle Hermione, and if there <i>was</i> and
it turned out to be <i>broomstick riding</i> instead of anything
intellectual, Harry would just die.)</p>
<p>It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of
them. Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked around
the field, correcting grips and stances. Apparently even among the
few children who'd been allowed to fly at home, they hadn't been
taught to do it correctly.</p>
<p>Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded. "Now, when I
blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his
stomach.</p>
<p>"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come
straight back down by leaning forwards slightly. On my whistle -
three - two -"</p>
<p>One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy's
screams - of horror, not delight. The boy was spinning at an awful
rate as he ascended, they only got glimpses of his white face -</p>
<p>As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own
broomstick and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn't really
know what he planned to do with it, he'd had exactly two sessions
of Charms and the last one <i>had</i> been the Hover Charm but
Harry had only been able to cast the spell successfully one time
out of three and he certainly couldn't levitate whole people -</p>
<p><i>If there is any hidden power in me, let it reveal itself
NOW!</i></p>
<p>"Come back, boy!" shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the most
unhelpful instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-control
broomstick, from a <i>flying instructor</i>, and a fully automatic
section of Harry's brain added Madam Hooch to his tally of
fools).</p>
<p>And the boy was thrown off the broomstick.</p>
<p>He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first.</p>
<p>"<i>Wingardium Leviosa!</i>" screamed Harry.</p>
<p>The spell failed. He could feel it fail.</p>
<p>There was a THUD and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay
facedown on the grass in a heap.</p>
<p>Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He
arrived at the boy's side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and
Harry reached into his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was
the name never mind he'd just try "Healer's Pack!" and it popped up
into his hand and -</p>
<p>"Broken wrist," Madam Hooch said. "Calm down, boy, he just has a
broken wrist!"</p>
<p>There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry's mind snapped out of
Panic Mode.</p>
<p>The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and
there was a syringe of liquid fire in Harry's hand, which would
have kept the boy's brain oxygenated if he'd managed to snap his
neck.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice. His heart
was pounding so loudly that he almost couldn't hear himself panting
for breath. "Broken bone... right... Setting String?"</p>
<p>"That's for emergencies only," snapped Madam Hooch. "Put it
away, he's fine." She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand.
"Come on, boy, it's all right, up you get!"</p>
<p>"You're not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick
again?" Harry said in horror.</p>
<p>Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. "Of course not!" She pulled the
boy to his feet using his good arm - Harry saw with a shock that it
was Neville Longbottom <i>again,</i> what was <i>with</i> him? -
and she turned to all the watching children. "None of you is to
move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those
brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can
say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."</p>
<p>And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching his
wrist and trying to control his sniffles.</p>
<p>When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started
giggling.</p>
<p>That set off the others.</p>
<p>Harry turned and looked at them. It seemed like a good time to
memorise some faces.</p>
<p>And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied
by Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe wasn't smiling. Mr. Goyle
decidedly was. Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face
that twitched occasionally, from which Harry inferred that Draco
thought it was hilarious but saw no political advantage to be
gained by laughing about it now instead of in the Slytherin
dungeons afterwards.</p>
<p>"Well, Potter," Draco said in a low voice that didn't carry,
still with that very controlled face that was twitching
occasionally, "Just wanted to say, when you take advantage of
emergencies to demonstrate leadership, you want to look like you're
in total control of the situation, rather than, say, going into a
complete panic." Mr. Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling
look. "But you probably scored a few points anyway. You need any
help stowing that healer's kit?"</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face
turned away from Draco. "I think I'm fine," Harry said. He put the
syringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up.</p>
<p>Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back
into his mokeskin pouch.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff," Ernie
Macmillan said formally. "It was a good try and a good
thought."</p>
<p>"A good thought indeed," drawled Draco. "Why didn't anyone in
Hufflepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you'd <i>all</i> helped
instead of just Potter, you could've caught him. I thought
Hufflepuffs were supposed to stick together?"</p>
<p>Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting
to die of shame. "We didn't think of it in time -"</p>
<p>"Ah," said Draco, "didn't <i>think</i> of it, I guess that's why
it's better to have one Ravenclaw as a friend than all of
Hufflepuff."</p>
<p>Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one... "You're
not helping," Harry said in a mild tone. Hoping Draco would
interpret that as <i>you're interfering with my plans, please shut
up.</i></p>
<p>"Hey, what's this?" said Mr. Goyle. He stooped to the grass and
picked up something around the size of a large marble, a glass ball
that seemed to be filled with a swirling white mist.</p>
<p>Ernie blinked. "Neville's Remembrall!"</p>
<p>"What's a Remembrall?" asked Harry.</p>
<p>"It turns red if you've forgotten something," Ernie said. "It
doesn't tell you what you forgot, though. Give it here, please, and
I'll hand it back to Neville later." Ernie held out his hand.</p>
<p>A sudden grin flashed across Mr. Goyle's face and he spun around
and raced away.</p>
<p>Ernie stood still for a moment in surprise, and then shouted
"Hey!" and ran after Mr. Goyle.</p>
<p>And Mr. Goyle grabbed a broomstick, hopped on with one smooth
motion and took to the air.</p>
<p>Harry's jaw dropped. Hadn't Madam Hooch said that would get him
<i>expelled?</i></p>
<p><i>"That idiot!</i>" Draco hissed. He opened his mouth to shout
-</p>
<p>"<i>Hey!</i>" shouted Ernie. "That's Neville's! <i>Give it
back!</i>"</p>
<p>The Slytherins started cheering and hooting.</p>
<p>Draco's mouth snapped shut. Harry caught the sudden look of
indecision on his face.</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said in a low tone, "if you don't order that
idiot back on the ground, the teacher's going to get back and
-"</p>
<p>"<i>Come and get it, Hufflepuffle!</i>" shouted Mr. Goyle, and
a great cheer went up from the Slytherins.</p>
<p>"I <i>can't!</i>" whispered Draco. "Everyone in Slytherin would
think I'm <i>weak!</i>"</p>
<p>"And if Mr. Goyle gets expelled," hissed Harry, "your
<i>father</i> is going to think you're a <i>moron!</i>"</p>
<p>Draco's face twisted in agony.</p>
<p>At that moment -</p>
<p>"Hey, <i>Slytherslime</i>," shouted Ernie, "didn't anyone ever
tell you that Hufflepuffs stick together? <i>Wands out,
Hufflepuff!</i>"</p>
<p>And there were suddenly a whole lot of wands pointed in Mr.
Goyle's direction.</p>
<p>Three seconds later -</p>
<p>"<i>Wands out, Slytherin!</i>" said around five different
Slytherins.</p>
<p>And there were a whole lot of wands pointed in Hufflepuff's
direction.</p>
<p>Two seconds later -</p>
<p>"<i>Wands out, Gryffindor!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Do something, Potter!</i>" whispered Draco. "<i>I can't be
the one to stop this it has to be you! I'll owe you a favour just
think of something aren't you supposed to be brilliant?</i>"</p>
<p>In around five and a half seconds, realised Harry, someone was
going to cast the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex and by the time it was
over and the teachers were done expelling people the only boys left
in his year would be Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>"<i>Wands out, Ravenclaw!</i>" shouted Michael Corner who was
apparently feeling left out of the disaster.</p>
<p>"<i>GREGORY GOYLE!"</i> screamed Harry<i>. "I challenge you to a
contest for possession of Neville's Remembrall!"</i></p>
<p>There was a sudden pause.</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" said Draco in the loudest drawl Harry had ever
heard. "That sounds interesting. What sort of contest, Potter?"</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>"Contest" had been as far as Harry's inspiration had gotten.
What sort of contest, he couldn't say "chess" because Draco
wouldn't be able to accept without it looking strange, he couldn't
say "arm-wrestling" because Mr. Goyle would crush him -</p>
<p>"How about this?" Harry said loudly. "Gregory Goyle and I stand
apart from each other, and no one else is allowed to come near
either of us. We don't use our wands and neither does anyone else.
I don't move from where I'm standing, and neither does he. And if I
can get my hands on Neville's Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle
relinquishes all claim to that Remembrall he's holding and gives it
to me."</p>
<p>There was another pause as people's looks of relief transmuted
to confusion.</p>
<p>"Hah, Potter!" said Draco loudly. "I'd like to see you do
<i>that!</i> Mr. Goyle accepts!"</p>
<p>"It's on!" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Potter, <i>what?</i>" whispered Draco, which he somehow did
without moving his lips.</p>
<p>Harry didn't know how to answer without moving his.</p>
<p>People were putting their wands away, and Mr. Goyle swooped
gracefully to the ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs
started over towards Mr. Goyle, but Harry shot them a desperately
pleading look and they backed off.</p>
<p>Harry walked toward Mr. Goyle and stopped when he was a few
paces away, far enough apart that they couldn't reach each
other.</p>
<p>Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed his wand.</p>
<p>Everyone else backed away.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. He knew in broad outline what he <i>wanted</i>
to do, but it had to be done in such a way that no one understood
<i>what</i> he'd done -</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said loudly. "And now..." He took a deep
breath and raised one hand, fingers ready to snap. There were gasps
from anyone who'd heard about the pies, which was practically
everyone. "<i>I call upon the insanity of Hogwarts! Happy happy
boom boom swamp swamp swamp!</i>" And Harry snapped his
fingers.</p>
<p>A lot of people flinched.</p>
<p>And nothing happened.</p>
<p>Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing,
until...</p>
<p>"Um," someone said. "Is that it?"</p>
<p>Harry looked at the boy who'd spoken. "Look in front of you. You
see that patch of ground that looks barren, without any grass on
it?"</p>
<p>"Um, yeah," said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?).</p>
<p>"Dig it up."</p>
<p>Now Harry was getting a lot of strange looks.</p>
<p>"Er, why?" said Dean something.</p>
<p>"Just do it," said Terry Boot in a weary voice. "No point asking
why, trust me on this one."</p>
<p>Dean something kneeled down and began to scoop away dirt.</p>
<p>After a minute or so, Dean stood up again. "There's nothing
there," Dean said.</p>
<p>Huh. Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a
treasure map that would lead to another treasure map that would
lead to Neville's Remembrall which he would put there after getting
it back from Mr. Goyle...</p>
<p>Then Harry realised there was a much simpler way which didn't
threaten the secret of Time-Turners quite as much.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Dean!" Harry said loudly. "Ernie, would you look around
on the ground where Neville fell and see if you can find Neville's
Remembrall?"</p>
<p>People looked even more confused.</p>
<p>"Just do it," said Terry Boot. "He'll keep trying until
something works, and the scary thing is that -"</p>
<p>"<i>Merlin!</i>" gasped Ernie. He was holding up Neville's
Remembrall. "It's <i>here!</i> Right where he fell!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" cried Mr. Goyle. He looked down and saw...</p>
<p>...that he was still holding Neville's Remembrall.</p>
<p>There was a rather long pause.</p>
<p>"Er," said Dean something, "that's not possible, is it?"</p>
<p>"It's a plot hole," said Harry. "I made myself weird enough to
distract the universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had
already picked up the Remembrall."</p>
<p>"No, wait, I mean, that's <i>totally</i> not possible -"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, are we all standing around here waiting to go flying
on broomsticks? Yes we are. So shut up. Anyway, once I get my hands
on Neville's Remembrall, the contest is over and Gregory Goyle has
to relinquish all claim to the Remembrall he's holding and give it
to me. Those were the terms, remember?" Harry stretched out a hand
and beckoned Ernie. "Just roll it over here, since no one's
supposed to get close to me, okay?"</p>
<p>"Hold on!" shouted a Slytherin - Blaise Zabini, Harry wasn't
likely to forget that name. "How do we know that's Neville's
Remembrall? You could've just dropped <i>another</i> Remembrall
there -"</p>
<p>"The Slytherin is strong with this one," Harry said, smiling.
"But you have my word that the one Ernie's holding is Neville's. No
comment about the one Gregory Goyle's holding."</p>
<p>Zabini spun to Draco. "<i>Malfoy!</i> You're not just going to
let him get away with that -"</p>
<p>"Shut up, you," rumbled Mr. Crabbe, standing behind Draco. "Mr.
Malfoy doesn't need <i>you</i> to tell him what to do!"</p>
<p><i>Good</i> minion.</p>
<p>"My bet was with Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Malfoy," Harry said. "Not with you, Zabini. I have done what Mr.
Malfoy said he'd like to see me do, and as for the judgment of the
bet, I leave that up to Mr. Malfoy." Harry inclined his head
towards Draco and raised his eyebrows slightly. That ought to allow
Draco to save enough face.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"You promise that actually <i>is</i> Neville's Remembrall?"
Draco said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "That's the one that'll go back to Neville
and it was his originally. And the one Gregory Goyle's holding goes
to me."</p>
<p>Draco nodded, looking decisive. "I won't question the word of
the Noble House of Potter, then, no matter how strange that all
was. And the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy keeps its word
as well. Mr. Goyle, give that to Mr. Potter -"</p>
<p>"Hey!" Zabini said. "He hasn't won <i>yet</i>, he hasn't got his
hands on -"</p>
<p>"Catch, Harry!" said Ernie, and he tossed the Remembrall.</p>
<p>Harry easily snapped the Remembrall out of the air, he'd always
had good reflexes that way. "There," said Harry, "I win..."</p>
<p>Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped.</p>
<p>The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like
a miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad
daylight.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be specific, 5:09pm on Thursday afternoon, in
Professor McGonagall's office, after flying classes. (With an extra
hour for Harry slipped in between.)</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sitting on her stool. Harry in the hot seat
in front of her desk.</p>
<p>"Professor," Harry said tightly, "Slytherin was pointing their
wands at Hufflepuff, Gryffindor was pointing their wands at
Slytherin, some <i>idiot</i> called wands out in Ravenclaw, and I
had maybe five seconds to keep the whole thing from blowing
sky-high! It was all I could think of!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's face was pinched and angry. "<i>You are
not to use the Time-Turner in that fashion, Mr. Potter!</i> Is the
concept of secrecy not something that you understand?"</p>
<p>"They don't <i>know</i> how I did it! They just think I can do
really weird things by snapping my fingers! I've done other weird
stuff that can't be done with Time-Turners even, and I'll do
<i>more</i> stuff like that, and <i>this</i> case won't even stand
out! I <i>had to do it,</i> Professor!"</p>
<p>"You did <i>not</i> have to do it!" snapped Professor
McGonagall. "All you needed to do was get this <i>anonymous
Slytherin</i> back on the ground and the wands put away! You could
have challenged him to a game of Exploding Snap but no, you had to
use the Time-Turner in a flagrant and unnecessary manner!"</p>
<p>"It was all I could think of! I don't even know what Exploding
Snap <i>is,</i> they wouldn't have accepted a game of chess and if
I'd picked arm-wresting I would have lost!"</p>
<p>"<i>Then you should have picked wrestling!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "But then I'd have <i>lost</i> -"</p>
<p>Harry stopped.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall was looking <i>very</i> angry.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Professor McGonagall," Harry said in a small voice.
"I honestly didn't think of that, and you're right, I should have,
it would have been brilliant if I had, but I just didn't think of
that at all..."</p>
<p>Harry's voice trailed off. It was suddenly apparent to him that
he'd had a <i>lot</i> of other options. He could have asked
<i>Draco</i> to suggest something, he could have asked the crowd...
his use of the Time-Turner <i>had</i> been flagrant and
unnecessary. There had been a giant space of possibilities, why had
he picked <i>that</i> one?</p>
<p>Because he'd seen a way to <i>win.</i> Win possession of an
unimportant trinket that the teachers would've taken back from Mr.
Goyle anyway.</p>
<p>Intent to win. That was what had gotten him.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said again. "For my pride and my
stupidity."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall wiped a hand across her forehead. Some of
her anger seemed to dissipate. But her voice still came out very
hard. "One more display like that, Mr. Potter, and you will be
returning that Time-Turner. Do I make myself very clear?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "I understand and I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Potter, you will be allowed to retain the Time-Turner
for now. And considering the size of the debacle you did, in fact,
avert, I will not deduct any points from Ravenclaw."</p>
<p><i>Plus you couldn't explain why you'd deducted the points.</i>
But Harry wasn't dumb enough to say that out loud.</p>
<p>"More importantly, why did the Remembrall go off like that?"
Harry said. "Does it mean I've been Obliviated?"</p>
<p>"That puzzles me as well," Professor McGonagall said slowly. "If
it were that simple, I would think that the courts would use
Remembralls, and they do not. I shall look into it, Mr. Potter."
She sighed. "You can go now."</p>
<p>Harry started to get up from his chair, then halted. "Um, sorry,
I did have something else I wanted to tell you -"</p>
<p>You could hardly see the flinch. "What is it, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"It's about Professor Quirrell -"</p>
<p>"I'm sure, Mr. Potter, that it is nothing of importance."
Professor McGonagall spoke the words in a great rush. "Surely you
heard the Headmaster tell the students that you were not to bother
us with any unimportant complaints about the Defence
Professor?"</p>
<p>Harry was rather confused. "But this could <i>be</i> important,
yesterday I got this sudden sense of doom when -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter! I have a sense of doom as well! And my sense of
doom is suggesting that <i>you must not finish that
sentence!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth gaped open. Professor McGonagall had succeeded;
Harry was speechless.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "if you have discovered
anything that seems interesting about Professor Quirrell, please
feel free not to share it with me or anyone else. Now I think
you've taken up enough of my valuable time -"</p>
<p>"<i>This isn't like you!</i>" Harry burst out. "I'm sorry but
that just seems <i>unbelievably</i> irresponsible! From what I've
heard there's some kind of jinx on the Defence position, and if you
already <i>know</i> something's going to go wrong, I'd think you'd
all be on your toes -"</p>
<p>"Go <i>wrong</i>, Mr. Potter? <i>I certainly hope not.</i>"
Professor McGonagall's face was expressionless. "After Professor
Blake was caught in a closet with no fewer than three fifth-year
Slytherins last February, and a year before that, Professor Summers
failed so completely as an educator that her students thought a
boggart was a kind of furniture, it would be <i>catastrophic</i> if
some problem with the extraordinarily competent Professor Quirrell
came to my attention now, and I daresay most of our students would
fail their Defence O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said slowly, taking it all in. "So in other
words, whatever's wrong with Professor Quirrell, you desperately
don't want to know about it until the end of the school year. And
since it's currently September, he could assassinate the Prime
Minister on live television and get away with it so far as you're
concerned."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall gazed at him unblinkingly. "I am certain
that I could never be heard endorsing such a statement, Mr. Potter.
At Hogwarts we strive to be proactive with respect to
<i>anything</i> that threatens the educational attainment of our
students."</p>
<p><i>Such as first-year Ravenclaws who can't keep their mouths
shut.</i> "I believe I understand you completely, Professor
McGonagall."</p>
<p>"Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt that very much."
Professor McGonagall leaned forward, her face tightening again.
"Since you and I have already discussed matters far more sensitive
than these, I shall speak frankly. You, and you alone, have
reported this mysterious sense of doom. You, and you alone, are a
chaos magnet the likes of which I have never seen. After our little
shopping trip to Diagon Alley, and <i>then</i> the Sorting Hat, and
then <i>today's</i> little episode, I can well foresee that I am
fated to sit in the Headmaster's office and hear some hilarious
tale about Professor Quirrell in which you and you alone play a
starring role, after which there will be no choice but to fire him.
I am already resigned to it, Mr. Potter. And if this sad event
takes place any earlier than the Ides of May, I will string you up
by the gates of Hogwarts with your own intestines and pour fire
beetles into your nose. <i>Now</i> do you understand me
completely?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, his eyes very wide. Then, after a second, "What do
I get if I can make it happen on the last day of the school
year?"</p>
<p>"<i>Get out of my office!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>There must have been something about Thursdays in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It was 5:32pm on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing next
to Professor Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that
guarded the entrance to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall's office
to the Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to
report to Professor Flitwick's office, and there Harry had learned
that Dumbledore wanted to speak to him.</p>
<p>Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick
if the Headmaster had said what this was about.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way.</p>
<p>Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to
invoke the words of power and madness.</p>
<p><i>Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp?</i> Harry had
thought but not said aloud.</p>
<p>"Please don't worry too much, Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor
Flitwick from somewhere around Harry's shoulder level. (Harry was
grateful for Professor Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, it was hard
getting used to a Professor who was not only shorter than him but
spoke in a higher-pitched voice.) "Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a
little odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never
hurt a student in the slightest, and I don't believe he ever will."
Professor Flitwick gave Harry an encouraging smile. "Just keep that
in mind at all times and you'll be sure not to panic!"</p>
<p>This was not helping.</p>
<p>"Good luck!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the
gargoyle and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at
all. (Of course, the password wouldn't be much good if you could
hear someone saying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a
very natural and ordinary movement that Harry found rather
shocking, since the gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable
stone the whole time.</p>
<p>Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs.
There was something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more
disturbing was that <i>revolving</i> the spiral ought not to take
you anywhere.</p>
<p>"Up you go!" squeaked Flitwick.</p>
<p>Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found
himself, for some reason that his brain couldn't seem to visualise
at all, moving upwards.</p>
<p>The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral
stairs kept turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a
rather dizzying time, Harry found himself in front of an oak door
with a brass griffin knocker.</p>
<p>Harry reached out and turned the doorknob.</p>
<p>The door swung open.</p>
<p>And Harry saw the most interesting room he'd ever seen in his
life.</p>
<p>There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or
slowly changed shape or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were
dozens of mysterious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers,
all bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, or forming into
interesting shapes that vanished half a second after you saw them.
There were things that looked like clocks with many hands,
inscribed with numbers or in unrecognisable languages. There was a
bracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkled with a thousand
colors, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, and a wooden cup
filled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falcon
encrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with pictures of
people sleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a
hatrack that was also holding two umbrellas and three red slippers
for left feet.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk.
Before the desk was an oaken stool. And behind the desk was a
well-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, who was adorned with a long silver beard, a hat like a
squashed giant mushroom, and what looked to Muggle eyes like three
layers of bright pink pyjamas.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a mad
intensity.</p>
<p>With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the
desk. The door swung shut behind him with a loud <i>thunk.</i></p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Hello, Headmaster," Harry replied. So they were on a first-name
basis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him -</p>
<p>"Please, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Headmaster sounds so formal.
Just call me Heh for short."</p>
<p>"I'll be sure to, Heh," said Harry.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Do you know," said Dumbledore, "you're the first person who's
ever taken me up on that?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He tried to control his voice despite the
sudden sinking feeling in his stomach. "I'm sorry, I, ah,
Headmaster, you told me to do it so I did -"</p>
<p>"Heh, please!" said Dumbledore cheerfully. "And there's no call
to be so worried, I won't launch you out a window just because you
make one mistake. I'll give you plenty of warnings first, if you're
doing something wrong! Besides, what matters isn't how people talk
to you, it's what they think of you."</p>
<p><i>He's never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and
you'll be sure not to panic.</i></p>
<p>Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open,
showing some small yellow lumps. "Sherbet lemon?" said the
Headmaster.</p>
<p>"Er, no thank you, Heh," said Harry. <i>Does slipping a student
LSD count as hurting them, or does that fall into the category of
harmless fun?</i> "You, um, said something about my being too young
to invoke the words of power and madness?"</p>
<p>"That you most certainly are!" Dumbledore said. "Thankfully the
Words of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago and no one
has the slightest idea what they are anymore. It was just a little
remark."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He was aware that his mouth was hanging
open. "Why did you call me here, then?"</p>
<p>"<i>Why?</i>" Dumbledore repeated. "Ah, Harry, if I went around
all day asking <i>why</i> I do things, I'd never have time to get a
single thing done! I'm quite a busy person, you know."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, smiling. "Yes, it was a very impressive list.
Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and
Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.
Sorry to ask but I was wondering, is it possible to get more than
six hours if you use more than one Time-Turner? Because it's pretty
impressive if you're doing all that on just thirty hours a
day."</p>
<p>There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on
smiling. He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive,
but once it had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately
messing with him, something within him <i>absolutely refused</i> to
sit and take it like a defenceless lump.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Time doesn't like being stretched out too much,"
said Dumbledore after the slight pause, "and yet we ourselves seem
to be a little too large for it, and so it's a constant struggle to
fit our lives into Time."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Harry said with grave solemnity. "That's why it's best
to come to our points quickly."</p>
<p>For a moment Harry wondered if he'd gone too far.</p>
<p>Then Dumbledore chuckled. "Straight to the point it shall be."
The Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat
and brushing his beard against his desk. "Harry, this Monday you
did something that should have been impossible even with a
Time-Turner. Or rather, impossible with <i>only</i> a Time-Turner.
Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?"</p>
<p>A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He'd done that using
the Cloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a
Christmas box along with a note, and that note had said: <i>If
Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows he
would never let it escape his grasp.</i><i>...</i></p>
<p>"A natural thought," Dumbledore went on, "is that since none of
the first-years present were able to cast such a spell, someone
else was present, and yet unseen. And if no one could see them,
why, it would be easy enough for them to throw the pies. One might
further suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you were the
invisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far
beyond your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak."
Dumbledore smiled conspiratorially. "Am I on the right track so
far, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would
not at all be wise, and possibly not the least bit helpful, and he
couldn't think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. "Don't worry, Harry, you
haven't done anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren't against the
rules - I suppose they're rare enough that no one ever got around
to putting them on the list. But really I was wondering something
else entirely."</p>
<p>"Oh?" Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes shone with enthusiasm. "You see, Harry, after
you've been through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of
these things. You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the
world. You begin to harbour suspicions <i>before</i> the moment of
revelation. You are the Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an invisibility
cloak made its way into your hands only four days after you
discovered our magical Britain. Such cloaks are not for sale in
Diagon Alley, but there is <i>one</i> which might find its own way
to a destined wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder if by some
strange chance you have found not just <i>an</i> invisibility
cloak, but <i>the</i> Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three
Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from the gaze of
Death himself." Dumbledore's gaze was bright and eager. "May I see
it, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his
system now and it was entirely useless, this was the most powerful
wizard in the world and there was no way he could make it out the
door and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for him to hide if he did,
he was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed down through
the Potters for who knew how long -</p>
<p>Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright
light had gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a little
sorrowful. "Harry," said Dumbledore, "if you don't want to, you can
just say no."</p>
<p>"I can?" Harry croaked.</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry," said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, and
worried. "It seems that you're afraid of me, Harry. May I ask what
I've done to earn your distrust?"</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Is there some way you can swear a binding
magical oath that you won't take my cloak?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head slowly. "Unbreakable Vows are not to
be used so lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know
the spell, you would have only my word that the spell was binding.
Yet surely you realise that I do not <i>need</i> your permission to
see the Cloak. I am powerful enough to draw it forth myself,
mokeskin pouch or no." Dumbledore's face was very grave. "But this
I will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. I will not seize it from
you. Not even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to
show it to me. That is a promise and an oath. Should I need to
prohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will require
you to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it there."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood
of adrenaline and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off
his belt. "If you really <i>don't</i> need my permission... then
you have it." Harry held out the pouch to Dumbledore, and bit down
hard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in case he was
Obliviated afterwards.</p>
<p>The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any
word of retrieval, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility.</p>
<p>"Ah," breathed Dumbledore. "I was right..." He poured the
shimmering black velvet mesh through his hand. "Centuries old, and
still as perfect as the day it was made. We have lost much of our
art over the years, and now I cannot make such a thing myself, no
one can. I can feel the power of it like an echo in my mind, like a
song forever being sung without anyone to hear it..." The wizard
looked up from the Cloak. "Do not sell it," he said, "do not give
it to anyone as a possession. Think twice before you show it to
anyone, and ponder three times again before you reveal it is a
Deathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing
of Power."</p>
<p>For a moment Dumbledore's face grew wistful...</p>
<p>...and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry put it back in his pouch.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face was grave once more. "May I ask again, Harry,
how you came to distrust me so?"</p>
<p>Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.</p>
<p>"There was a note with the Cloak," Harry said in a small voice.
"It said that you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew.
I don't know who left the note, though, I really don't."</p>
<p>"I... see," Dumbledore said slowly. "Well, Harry, I won't impugn
the motives of whoever left you that note. Who knows but that they
themselves may have had the best of good intentions? They did give
you the Cloak, after all."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore's charity, and abashed at
the sharp contrast with his own attitude.</p>
<p>The old wizard went on. "But you and I are both gamepieces of
the same color, I think. The boy who finally defeated Voldemort,
and the old man who held him off long enough for you to save the
day. I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we must all
do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice and
ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to
distrust me."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said. He felt wretched at this point, he'd
just told off Gandalf essentially, and Dumbledore's kindness was
only making him feel worse. "I shouldn't have distrusted you."</p>
<p>"Alas, Harry, in this world..." The old wizard shook his head.
"I cannot even say you were unwise. You did not know me. And in
truth there are some at Hogwarts who you would do well not to
trust. Perhaps even some you call friends."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. "Like who?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of
his instruments, a dial with eight hands of varying length.</p>
<p>After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again. "He probably
seems to you quite charming," said Dumbledore. "Polite - to you at
least. Well-spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready with a
helping hand, a favour, a word of advice -"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>Draco Malfoy!</i>" Harry said, feeling rather relieved
that it wasn't Hermione or something. "Oh no, no no no, you've got
it all wrong, he's not turning me, I'm turning him."</p>
<p>Dumbledore froze where he was peering at the dial. "You're
<i>what?</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side," Harry said.
"You know, make him a good guy."</p>
<p>Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing one
of the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone,
let alone someone with a long silver beard. "Are you certain," said
the old wizard after a moment, "that he is ready to be redeemed? I
fear that whatever goodness you think you see within him is only
wishful thinking - or worse, a lure, a bait -"</p>
<p>"Er, not likely," Harry said. "I mean if he's trying to disguise
himself as a good guy he's incredibly bad at it. This isn't a
question of Draco coming up to me and being all charming and me
deciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down. I
selected him for redemption specifically because he's the heir to
House Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would
obviously be him."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's left eye twitched. "You intend to sow seeds of love
and kindness in Draco Malfoy's heart because you expect Malfoy's
heir to prove valuable to you?"</p>
<p>"Not just to <i>me!</i>" Harry said indignantly. "To all of
magical Britain, if this works out! <i>And</i> he'll have a happier
and mentally healthier life himself! Look, I don't have enough time
to turn <i>everyone</i> away from the Dark Side and I've got to ask
where the Light can gain the most advantage the fastest -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harry
would expect, almost howling. It seemed positively
<i>undignified.</i> An ancient and powerful wizard ought to chuckle
in deep booming tones, not laugh so hard he was gasping for breath.
Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while watching the
Marx Brothers movie <i>Duck Soup,</i> and that was how hard
Dumbledore was laughing now.</p>
<p>"It's not <i>that</i> funny," Harry said after a while. He was
starting to worry about Dumbledore's sanity again.</p>
<p>Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible
effort. "Ah, Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is
that you begin laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny,
because when you're wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!" The
old wizard wiped tears away from his eyes. "Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft
evil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed."</p>
<p>Harry's brain took a moment to place the familiar words... "Hey,
that's a <i>Tolkien</i> quote! <i>Gandalf</i> says that!"</p>
<p>"Theoden, actually," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"You're <i>Muggleborn?</i>" Harry said in shock.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," said Dumbledore, smiling again. "I was born
seventy years before that book was published, dear child. But it
seems that my Muggleborn students tend to think alike in certain
ways. I have accumulated no fewer than twenty copies of <i>The Lord
of the Rings</i> and three sets of Tolkien's entire collected
works, and I treasure every one of them." Dumbledore drew his wand
and held it up and struck a pose. "<i>You cannot pass!</i> How does
that look?"</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said in something approaching complete brain
shutdown, "I think you're missing a Balrog." And the pink pyjamas
and squashed mushroom hat were not helping in the slightest.</p>
<p>"I see." Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his
belt. "I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of
late. Nowadays it's all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try
desperately to prevent any work from getting done, and formal
dinners where foreign politicians compete to see who can be the
most obstinate fool. And being mysterious at people, knowing things
I have no way of knowing, making cryptic statements which can only
be understood in hindsight, and all the other small ways in which
powerful wizards amuse themselves after they have left the part of
the pattern that allows them to be heroes. Speaking of which,
Harry, I have a certain something to give you, something which
belonged to your father."</p>
<p>"You do?" said Harry. "Gosh, who would have figured."</p>
<p>"Yes indeed," said Dumbledore. "I suppose it is a little
predictable, isn't it?" His face turned solemn.
"Nonetheless..."</p>
<p>Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one
of the drawers as he did so. He reached in using both arms, and,
straining slightly, pulled a rather large and heavy-looking object
out of the drawer, which he then deposited on his oaken desk with a
huge thunk.</p>
<p>"This," Dumbledore said, "was your father's rock."</p>
<p>Harry stared at it. It was light gray, discolored, irregularly
shaped, sharp-edged, and very much a plain old ordinary large rock.
Dumbledore had deposited it so that it rested on the widest
available cross-section, but it still wobbled unstably on his
desk.</p>
<p>Harry looked up. "This is a joke, right?"</p>
<p>"It is not," said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very
serious. "I took this from the ruins of James and Lily's home in
Godric's Hollow, where also I found you; and I have kept it from
then until now, against the day when I could give it to you."</p>
<p>In the mixture of hypotheses that served as Harry's model of the
world, Dumbledore's insanity was rapidly rising in probability. But
there <i>was</i> still a substantial amount of probability
allocated to other alternatives... "Um, is it a <i>magical</i>
rock?"</p>
<p>"Not so far as I know," said Dumbledore. "But I advise you with
the greatest possible stringency to keep it close about your person
at all times."</p>
<p>All right. Dumbledore was <i>probably</i> insane but if he
<i>wasn't</i>... well, it would be just too <i>embarrassing</i> to
get in trouble from ignoring the advice of the inscrutable old
wizard. That had to be like #4 on the list of the Top 100 Obvious
Failure Modes.</p>
<p>Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to
find some angle from which to lift it without cutting himself.
"I'll put it in my pouch, then."</p>
<p>Dumbledore frowned. "That may not be close enough to your
person. And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?"</p>
<p>"You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look. "That might prove
wise."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. It looked rather heavy. "I'd think the other
students would tend to ask me questions about that."</p>
<p>"Tell them I ordered you to do it," said Dumbledore. "No one
will question that, since they all think I'm insane." His face was
still perfectly serious.</p>
<p>"Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to
carry large rocks I can kind of see why people would think
that."</p>
<p>"Ah, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, a sweep
of one hand that seemed to take in all the mysterious instruments
around the room. "When we are young we believe that we know
everything, and so we believe that if we see no explanation for
something, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise
that the whole universe works by a rhythm and a reason, even if we
ourselves do not know it. It is only our own ignorance which
appears to us as insanity."</p>
<p>"Reality is always lawful," said Harry, "even if we don't know
the law."</p>
<p>"Precisely, Harry," said Dumbledore. "To understand this - and I
see that you <i>do</i> understand it - is the essence of
wisdom."</p>
<p>"So... <i>why</i> do I have to carry this rock exactly?"</p>
<p>"I can't think of a reason, actually," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"...you can't."</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded. "But just because I can't think of a reason
doesn't mean there <i>is</i> no reason."</p>
<p>The instruments ticked on.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Harry, "I'm not even sure if I should be saying
this, but that is simply not the correct way to deal with our
admitted ignorance of how the universe works."</p>
<p>"It isn't?" said the old wizard, looking surprised and
disappointed.</p>
<p>Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work
out in his favour, but he carried on regardless. "No. I don't even
know if that fallacy has an official name, but if I had to make one
up myself, it would be 'privileging the hypothesis' or something
like that. How can I put this formally... um... suppose you had a
million boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And
you had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector
always went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the
time on boxes that didn't have a diamond. If you ran twenty
detectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on average, one false
candidate and one true candidate left. And then it would just take
one or two more detectors before you were left with the one true
candidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible
answers, <i>most</i> of the evidence you need goes into just
<i>locating</i> the true hypothesis out of millions of
possibilities - bringing it to your attention in the first place.
The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three
plausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just
jump ahead without evidence and promote one particular possibility
to the focus of your attention, you're skipping over most of the
work. Like, you live in a city where there are a million people,
and there's a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no
evidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that
Mortimer Snodgrass did it?"</p>
<p>"Did he?" said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"No," said Harry. "But later it turns out that the murderer had
black hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone's like, ah,
looks like Mortimer did it after all. So it's unfair to Mortimer
for the police to <i>promote him to their attention</i> without
having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are
lots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just
<i>locating</i> the true answer - starting to pay attention to it.
You don't need <i>proof</i>, or the sort of official evidence that
scientists or courts demand, but you need some sort of <i>hint</i>,
and that hint has to discriminate that particular possibility from
the millions of others. Otherwise you can't just pluck the right
answer out of thin air. You can't even pluck a possibility worth
thinking about out of thin air. And there's got to be a million
other things I could do besides carrying around my father's rock.
Just because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't mean that I'm
unsure about how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty.
The laws for thinking with probabilities are no less iron than the
laws that govern old-fashioned logic, and what you just did is
<i>not allowed.</i>" Harry paused. "<i>Unless</i>, of course, you
have some <i>hint</i> you're not mentioning."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful.
"An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at
the point where you make an analogy between a million potential
murderers only one of whom committed the murder, and taking one out
of many possible courses of action, when many possible courses of
action may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your father's
rock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is
wiser to do than not."</p>
<p>Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had
accessed earlier, this time seeming to root around inside - at
least his arm seemed to be moving. "I will remark," Dumbledore said
while Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this
completely unexpected rejoinder, "that it is a common misconception
of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving
none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw
indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which
is not at all the same quality as being intelligent." The wizard
was smiling as he bent over the drawer. "Nonetheless, you <i>do</i>
seem rather intelligent. Less like an ordinary young hero and more
like a young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may have been
taking the wrong approach with you, Harry, and that you may be able
to understand things that few others could grasp. So I shall be
daring, and offer you a certain <i>other</i> heirloom."</p>
<p>"You don't mean..." gasped Harry. "My father... <i>owned another
rock?</i>"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Dumbledore, "I <i>am</i> still older and more
mysterious than you and if there are any revelations to be made
then <i>I</i> will do the revealing, thank you... oh, where
<i>is</i> that thing!" Dumbledore reached down further into the
desk drawer, and still further. His head and shoulders and whole
torso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking
out, as though the desk drawer was eating him.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but wonder just how much stuff was in there
and what the complete inventory would look like.</p>
<p>Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the
objective of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside
the rock.</p>
<p>It was a used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook:
<i>Intermediate Potion Making</i> by Libatius Borage. There was a
picture of a smoking vial on the cover.</p>
<p>"This," Dumbledore intoned, "was your mother's fifth-year
Potions textbook."</p>
<p>"Which I am to carry with me at all times," said Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>Which holds a terrible secret</i>. A secret whose revelation
could prove so disastrous that I must ask you to swear - and I do
require you to swear it seriously, Harry, whatever you may think of
all this - never to tell anyone or anything else."</p>
<p>Harry considered his mother's fifth-year Potions textbook,
which, apparently, held a terrible secret.</p>
<p>The problem was that Harry <i>did</i> take that oaths like that
very seriously. Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the right
sort of person.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>"I'm feeling thirsty," Harry said, "and that is not at all a
good sign."</p>
<p>Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this
cryptic statement. "<i>Do</i> you swear, Harry?" said Dumbledore.
His eyes gazed intently into Harry's. "Otherwise I cannot tell
you."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry. "I swear." That was the trouble with being a
Ravenclaw. You couldn't refuse an offer like that or your curiosity
would eat you alive, and everyone else knew it.</p>
<p>"And I swear in turn," said Dumbledore, "that what I am about to
tell you is the truth."</p>
<p>Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harry
leaned in to see.</p>
<p>"Do you see these notes," Dumbledore said in a voice so low it
was almost a whisper, "written in the margins of the book?"</p>
<p>Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed to be
describing something called a <i>potion of eagle's splendour,</i>
many of the ingredients being items that Harry didn't recognise at
all and whose names didn't appear to derive from English. Scrawled
in the margin was a handwritten annotation saying, <i>I wonder what
would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of
blueberries?</i> and immediately beneath was a reply in different
handwriting, <i>You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.</i></p>
<p>"I see them," said Harry. "What about them?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. "The ones in this
handwriting," he said, still in that low voice, "were written by
your mother. And the ones in <i>this</i> handwriting," moving his
finger to indicate the first scrawl, "were written by me. I would
turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was
sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they
had the most amazing fights."</p>
<p>That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the
Headmaster of Hogwarts <i>was,</i> in fact, crazy.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression. "Do you
understand the implications of what I have just told you,
Harry?"</p>
<p>"Ehhh..." Harry said. His voice seemed to be stuck. "Sorry...
I... not really..."</p>
<p>"Ah well," said Dumbledore, and sighed. "I suppose your
cleverness has limits after all, then. Shall we all just pretend I
didn't say anything?"</p>
<p>Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile. "Of course,"
Harry said. "You know it's actually getting rather late in the day
and I'm a bit hungry, so I should be going down to dinner, really"
and Harry made a beeline for the door.</p>
<p>The doorknob entirely failed to turn.</p>
<p>"You wound me, Harry," said Dumbledore's voice in quiet tones
that were coming from right behind him. "Do you not at least
realise that what I have told you is a sign of trust?"</p>
<p>Harry slowly turned around.</p>
<p>In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with
a long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and
wearing what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink
pyjamas.</p>
<p>Behind him was a door that didn't seem to be working at the
moment.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted
to lean on a wizard's staff he didn't have. "Really," said
Dumbledore, "you try anything new instead of following the same
pattern every time for a hundred and ten years, and people all
start running away." The old wizard shook his head in sorrow. "I'd
hoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I'd heard that your own
friends also think you mad. I know they are mistaken. Will you not
believe the same of me?"</p>
<p>"Please open the door," Harry said, his voice trembling. "If you
ever want me to trust you again, open the door."</p>
<p>There was the sound behind him of a door opening.</p>
<p>"There were more things I planned to say to you," Dumbledore
said, "and if you leave now, you will not know what they were."</p>
<p>Sometimes Harry absolutely <i>hated</i> being a Ravenclaw.</p>
<p><i>He's never hurt a student,</i> said Harry's Gryffindor side.
<i>Just keep remembering that and you'll be sure not to panic.
You're not going to run away just because things are getting
interesting, are you?</i></p>
<p><i>You can't just walk out on the Headmaster!</i> said the
Hufflepuff part. <i>What if he starts deducting House points? He
could make your school life very difficult if he decides he doesn't
like you!</i></p>
<p>And a piece of himself which Harry didn't much like but couldn't
quite manage to silence was pondering the potential advantages of
being one of the few friends of this mad old wizard who also
happened to be Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump. And
unfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better than
Draco at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying
things like <i>poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk
to, doesn't he?</i> and <i>you wouldn't want such a powerful man to
end up trusting someone less virtuous, would you?</i> and <i>I
wonder what sort of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you
if, you know, you became friends with him</i> and even <i>I bet
he's got a reaallly interesting book collection.</i></p>
<p><i>You're all a bunch of lunatics,</i> Harry thought at the
entire assemblage, but he'd been unanimously outvoted by every
component part of himself.</p>
<p>Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out,
and deliberately closed it again. It was a costless sacrifice given
that he was staying anyway, Dumbledore could control his movements
regardless, but maybe it would impress Dumbledore.</p>
<p>When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane
wizard was once more smiling and looking friendly. That was good,
maybe.</p>
<p>"Please don't do that again," Harry said. "I don't like being
trapped."</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> sorry about that, Harry," said Dumbledore in what
sounded like tones of sincere apology. "But it would have been
terribly unwise to let you leave without your father's rock."</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry said. "It wasn't reasonable of me to expect
the door to open before I put the quest items in my inventory."</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around
to the front of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave
up the rock in his eleven-year-old arms and feed it in.</p>
<p>He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the
Widening Lip charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was
rather noisy and had a distinctly complaining sound to it.</p>
<p>His mother's fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret
that was in fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.</p>
<p>And then Harry's inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for
ingratiating himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had
been perfectly pitched in such a way as to gain the support of the
majority Ravenclaw faction.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said. "Um. As long as I'm hanging around, I don't
suppose you would like to give me a bit of a tour of your office?
I'm a bit curious as to what some of these things are," and that
was his understatement for the month of September.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin.
"I'm flattered by your interest," said Dumbledore, "but I'm afraid
there isn't much to say." Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall
and pointed to a painting of a sleeping man. "These are portraits
of past Headmasters of Hogwarts." He turned and pointed to his
desk. "This is my desk." He pointed to his chair. "This is my chair
-"</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, "actually I was wondering about those."
Harry pointed to a small cube that was softly whispering
"blorple... blorple... blorple".</p>
<p>"Oh, the little fiddly things?" said Dumbledore. "They came with
the Headmaster's office and I have absolutely no idea what most of
them do. Although <i>this</i> dial with the eight hands counts the
number of, let's call them sneezes, by left-handed witches within
the borders of France, you would not believe how much work it took
to nail that down. And <i>this</i> one with the golden wibblers is
my own invention and Minerva is never, ever going to figure out
what it's doing."</p>
<p>Dumbledore took a step over to the hatrack while Harry was still
processing this. "Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe
the two of you have met. It told me that it was never again to be
placed on your head under any circumstances. You're only the
fourteenth student in history it's said that about, Baba Yaga was
another one and I'll tell you about the other twelve when you're
older. This is an umbrella. This is another umbrella." Dumbledore
took another few steps and turned around, now smiling quite
broadly. "And of course, most people who come to my office want to
see Fawkes."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden
platform.</p>
<p>Harry came over, rather puzzled. "This is Fawkes?"</p>
<p>"Fawkes is a phoenix," said Dumbledore. "Very rare, very
powerful magical creatures."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry said. He lowered his head and stared into the
tiny, beady black eyes, which showed not the slightest sign of
power or intelligence.</p>
<p>"Ahhh..." Harry said again.</p>
<p>He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird. It was
pretty hard to miss.</p>
<p>"Umm..."</p>
<p><i>Say something intelligent!</i> Harry's mind roared at itself.
<i>Don't just stand there sounding like a gibbering moron!</i></p>
<p><i>Well what the heck am I</i> supposed <i>to say?</i> Harry's
mind fired back.</p>
<p><i>Anything!</i></p>
<p><i>You mean, anything besides "Fawkes is a chicken" -</i></p>
<p><i>Yes! Anything but that!</i></p>
<p>"So, ah, what sort of magic do phoenixes do, then?"</p>
<p>"Their tears have the power to heal," Dumbledore said. "They are
creatures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire
may extinguish itself in one place and be kindled in another. The
tremendous strain of their innate magic ages their bodies quickly,
and yet they are as close to undying as any creature that exists in
this world, for whenever their bodies fail them they immolate
themselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or
sometimes an egg." Dumbledore came closer and inspected the
chicken, frowning. "Hm... looking a little peaky there, I'd
say."</p>
<p>By the time this statement registered fully in Harry's mind, the
chicken was already on fire.</p>
<p>The chicken's beak opened, but it didn't have time for so much
as a single caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was
brief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of
burning.</p>
<p>And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun,
leaving behind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden
platform.</p>
<p>"Don't look so horrified, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Fawkes
hasn't been hurt." Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then
the same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small
yellowish egg. "Look, here's an egg!"</p>
<p>"Oh... wow... amazing..."</p>
<p>"But now we really should get on with things," Dumbledore said.
Leaving the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to
his throne and seated himself. "It's almost time for dinner, after
all, and we wouldn't want to have to use our Time-Turners."</p>
<p>There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government of
Harry. Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing the
Headmaster of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken.</p>
<p>"Yes, things," said Harry's lips. "And then dinner."</p>
<p><i>You're sounding like a gibbering moron again</i> observed
Harry's Internal Critic.</p>
<p>"Well," Dumbledore said. "I fear I have a confession to make,
Harry. A confession and an apology."</p>
<p>"Apologies are good" <i>that doesn't even make sense! What am I
talking about?</i></p>
<p>The old wizard sighed deeply. "You may not still think so after
understanding what I have to say. I'm afraid, Harry, that I've been
manipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to
the care of your wicked stepparents -"</p>
<p>"My stepparents aren't wicked!" blurted Harry. "My
<i>parents,</i> I mean!"</p>
<p>"They aren't?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised and
disappointed. "Not even a little wicked? That doesn't fit the
pattern..."</p>
<p>Harry's inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs,
<i>SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!</i></p>
<p>"No, no," said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, "I was
just trying to spare your feelings, they're actually very
wicked..."</p>
<p>"They are?" Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently.
"What do they do?"</p>
<p><i>Talk fast</i> "they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash
problems and they don't let me read a lot of books and -"</p>
<p>"Ah, good, that's good to hear," said Dumbledore, leaning back
again. He smiled in a sad sort of way. "I apologise for
<i>that</i>, then. Now where was I? Ah, yes. I'm sorry to say,
Harry, that I am responsible for virtually everything bad that has
ever happened to you. I know that this will probably make you very
angry."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm very angry!" said Harry. "Grrr!"</p>
<p>Harry's Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award
for the Worst Acting in the History of Ever.</p>
<p>"And I just wanted you to know," Dumbledore said, "I wanted to
tell you as early as possible, in case something happens to one of
us later, that I am truly, truly sorry. For everything that has
already happened, and everything that will."</p>
<p>Moisture glistened in the old wizard's eyes.</p>
<p>"And I'm very angry!" said Harry. "So angry that I want to leave
right now unless you've got anything else to say!"</p>
<p><i>Just GO before he sets you on fire!</i> shrieked Slytherin,
Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor.</p>
<p>"I understand," said Dumbledore. "One last thing then, Harry.
You are <i>not</i> to attempt the forbidden door on the third-floor
corridor. There's no possible way you could get through all the
traps, and I wouldn't want to hear that you'd been hurt trying.
Why, I doubt that you could so much as open the first door, since
it's locked and you don't know the spell <i>Alohomora -</i>"</p>
<p>Harry spun around and bolted for the exit at top speed, the
doorknob turned agreeably in his hand and then he was racing down
the spiral stairs even as they turned, his feet almost stumbling
over themselves, in just a moment he was at the bottom and the
gargoyle was walking aside and Harry fired out of the stairwell
like a cannonball.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>There must have been something about Harry Potter.</p>
<p>It was Thursday for everyone, after all, and yet this sort of
thing didn't seem to happen to anyone else.</p>
<p>It was 6:21pm on Thursday afternoon when Harry Potter, firing
out of the stairwell like a cannonball and accelerating at top
speed, ran directly into Minerva McGonagall as she was turning a
corner on her way to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>Thankfully neither of them were much hurt. As had been explained
to Harry a little earlier in the day - back when he was refusing to
go anywhere near a broomstick again - Quidditch needed solid iron
Bludgers just to stand a decent chance of injuring the players,
since wizards tended to be a lot more resistant than Muggles to
impacts.</p>
<p>Harry and Professor McGonagall did both end up on the floor, and
the parchments she had been carrying went all over the
corridor.</p>
<p>There was a terrible, terrible pause.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," breathed Professor McGonagall from where she was
lying on the floor right next to Harry. Her voice rose to nearly a
shriek. "<i>What were you doing in the Headmaster's
office?"</i></p>
<p>"Nothing!" squeaked Harry.</p>
<p><i>"Were you talking about the Defence Professor?"</i></p>
<p>"No! Dumbledore called me up there and he gave me this big rock
and said it was my father's and I should carry it everywhere!"</p>
<p>There was another terrible pause.</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor McGonagall, her voice a little calmer.
She stood up, brushed herself off, and glared at the scattered
parchments, which jumped into a neat stack and scurried back
against the corridor wall as though to hide from her gaze. "My
sympathies, Mr. Potter, and I apologise for doubting you."</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall," Harry said. His voice was wavering. He
pushed himself off the floor, stood, and looked up at her
trustworthy, <i>sane</i> face. "Professor McGonagall..."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"Do you think I should?" Harry said in a small voice. "Carry my
father's rock everywhere?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. "That is between you and the
Headmaster, I'm afraid." She hesitated. "I will say that ignoring
the Headmaster completely is almost never wise. I <i>am</i> sorry
to hear of your dilemma, Mr. Potter, and if there's any way I
<i>can</i> help you with whatever you decide to do -"</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. "Actually I was thinking that once I know how,
I could Transfigure the rock into a ring and wear it on my finger.
If you could teach me how to sustain a Transfiguration -"</p>
<p>"It is good that you asked me first," Professor McGonagall said,
her face growing a bit stern. "If you lost control of the
Transfiguration the reversal would cut off your finger and probably
rip your hand in half. And at your age, even a ring is too large a
target for you to sustain indefinitely without it being a serious
drain on your magic. But I can have a ring forged for you with a
setting for a jewel, a <i>small</i> jewel, in contact with your
skin, and you can practice sustaining a safe subject, like a
marshmallow. When you have kept it up successfully, even in your
sleep, for a full month, I will allow you to Transfigure, ah, your
father's rock..." Professor McGonagall's voice trailed off. "Did
the Headmaster <i>really -</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes. Ah... um..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sighed. "That's a bit strange even for
him." She stooped and picked up the stack of parchments. "I'm sorry
about this, Mr. Potter. I apologise again for mistrusting you. But
now it's my own turn to see the Headmaster."</p>
<p>"Ah... good luck, I guess. Er..."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Um..."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall walked over to the gargoyle, inaudibly
spoke the password, and stepped through into the revolving spiral
stairs. She began to rise out of sight, and the gargoyle started
back -</p>
<p>"<i>Professor McGonagall the Headmaster set fire to a
chicken!"</i></p>
<p>"He <i>wha-</i>"</p>

<p><i>"That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't
it?"</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was breakfast time on Friday morning. Harry took another huge
bite out of his toast and then tried to remind his brain that
scarfing his breakfast wouldn't actually get him into the dungeons
any faster. Anyway they had a full hour of study time between
breakfast and the start of Potions.</p>
<p>But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry's imagination was already
sketching the chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, and patches
of glowing moss. Would there be rats? Would there be
<i>dragons?</i></p>
<p>"Harry Potter," said a quiet voice from behind him.</p>
<p>Harry looked over his shoulder and found himself beholding Ernie
Macmillan, smartly dressed in yellow-trimmed robes and looking a
little worried.</p>
<p>"Neville thought I should warn you," Ernie said in a low voice.
"I think he's right. Be careful of the Potions Master in our
session today. The older Hufflepuffs told us that Professor Snape
can be really nasty to people he doesn't like, and he doesn't like
most people who aren't Slytherins. If you say anything smart to him
it... it could be really bad for you, from what I've heard. Just
keep your head down and don't give him any reason to notice
you."</p>
<p>There was a pause as Harry processed this, and then he lifted
his eyebrows. (Harry wished he could raise just one eyebrow, like
Spock, but he'd never been able to manage.) "Thanks," Harry said.
"You might've just saved me a lot of trouble."</p>
<p>Ernie nodded, and turned to go back to the Hufflepuff table.</p>
<p>Harry resumed eating his toast.</p>
<p>It was around four bites afterward that someone said "Pardon
me," and Harry turned around to see an older Ravenclaw, looking a
little worried -</p>
<p>Some time later, Harry was finishing up his third plate of
rashers. (He'd learned to eat heavily at breakfast. He could always
eat lightly at lunch if he didn't end up using the Time-Turner.)
And there was yet another voice from behind him saying "Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said wearily, "I'll try not to draw Professor
Snape's attention -"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's hopeless," said Fred.</p>
<p>"Completely hopeless," said George.</p>
<p>"So we had the house elves bake you a cake," said Fred.</p>
<p>"We're going to put one candle on it for every point you lose
for Ravenclaw," said George.</p>
<p>"And have a party for you at the Gryffindor table during lunch,"
said Fred.</p>
<p>"We hope that'll cheer you up afterward," finished George.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed his last bite of rasher and turned around. "All
right," said Harry. "I wasn't going to ask this after Professor
Binns, I really wasn't, but if Professor Snape is <i>that</i> awful
why hasn't he been fired?"</p>
<p>"Fired?" said Fred.</p>
<p>"You mean, let go?" said George.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "It's what you do to bad teachers. You fire
them. Then you hire a better teacher instead. You don't have unions
or tenure here, right?"</p>
<p>Fred and George were frowning in much the same way that
hunter-gatherer tribal elders might frown if you tried to tell them
about calculus.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Fred after a while. "I never thought about
that."</p>
<p>"Me neither," said George.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Harry, "I get that a lot. See you at lunch, guys,
and don't blame me if there aren't any candles on that cake."</p>
<p>Fred and George both laughed, as if Harry had said something
funny, and bowed to him and headed back toward Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Harry turned back to the breakfast table and grabbed a cupcake.
His stomach already felt full, but he had a feeling this morning
might use a lot of calories.</p>
<p>As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he'd
met so far, Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a
ghost. From what Hermione had said about ghosts, it didn't seem
likely that they were fully self-aware. There were no famous
discoveries made by ghosts, or much of any original work, no matter
who they'd been in life. Ghosts tended to have trouble remembering
the current century. Hermione had said they were like accidental
portraits, impressed into the surrounding matter by a burst of
psychic energy accompanying a wizard's sudden death.</p>
<p>Harry had run into some stupid teachers during his abortive
forays into standard Muggle education - his father had been a lot
pickier when it came to selecting grad students as tutors, of
course - but History class was the first time he'd encountered a
teacher who literally wasn't sentient.</p>
<p>And it showed, too. Harry had given up after five minutes and
started reading a textbook. When it became clear that "Professor
Binns" wasn't going to object, Harry had also reached into his
pouch and gotten earplugs.</p>
<p>Did ghosts not require a salary? Was that it? Or was it
literally impossible to fire anyone in Hogwarts <i>even if they
died?</i></p>
<p>Now it seemed that Professor Snape was going about being
absolutely awful to everyone who wasn't a Slytherin and it hadn't
even <i>occurred</i> to anyone to terminate his contract.</p>
<p>And the Headmaster had set fire to a chicken.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," came a worried voice from behind him.</p>
<p>"I swear," Harry said without turning around, "this place is
almost eight and a half percent as bad as what Dad says about
Oxford."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted,
annoyed, and infuriated all at once.</p>
<p>"Dungeons!" Harry hissed. "<i>Dungeons!</i> These are not
dungeons! This is a basement! A <i>basement!</i>"</p>
<p>Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were
all used to him by now.</p>
<p>It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was
located was called the "dungeons" for no better reason than that it
was below ground and slightly colder than the main castle.</p>
<p>In <i>Hogwarts!</i> In <i>Hogwarts!</i> Harry had been waiting
his whole life and now he was <i>still</i> waiting and if there was
anywhere <i>on the face of the Earth</i> that had decent dungeons
it ought to be Hogwarts! Was Harry going to have to build his own
castle if he wanted to see one little bottomless abyss?</p>
<p>A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and
Harry cheered up considerably.</p>
<p>The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating
in huge jars on shelves that covered every centimeter of wall space
between the closets. Harry had gotten far enough along in his
reading now that he could actually identify some of the creatures,
like the Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit the fifty-centimeter spider
<i>looked</i> like an Acromantula but it was too small to <i>be</i>
one. He'd tried asking Hermione, but she hadn't seemed very
interested in looking anywhere near where he was pointing.</p>
<p>Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when
the assassin swept into the room.</p>
<p>That was the first thought that crossed Harry's mind when he saw
Professor Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about
the way the man stalked between the children's desks. His robes
were unkempt, his hair spotted and greasy. There was something
about him that seemed reminiscent of Lucius, although the two of
them looked nothing remotely alike, and you got the impression that
where Lucius would kill you with flawless elegance, this man would
simply kill you.</p>
<p>"Sit down," said Professor Severus Snape. "Now."</p>
<p>Harry and a few other children who had been standing around
talking to each other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on
ending up next to Hermione but somehow he found himself sitting
down in the nearest empty desk next to Justin Finch-Fletchley (it
was a Doubles session, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put him two
desks to the left of Hermione.</p>
<p>Severus seated himself behind the teacher's desk, and without
the slightest transition or introduction, said, "Hannah
Abbott."</p>
<p>"Here," said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Susan Bones."</p>
<p>"Present."</p>
<p>And so it went, no one daring to say a word in edgewise,
until:</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new... <i>celebrity.</i>"</p>
<p>"The celebrity is present, <i>sir</i>."</p>
<p>Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly
looked like they wanted to run out the door while the classroom was
still there.</p>
<p>Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the
next name on his list.</p>
<p>Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him
to do anything about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn't
like him, for whatever reason. And when Harry thought about it,
better by far that this Potions professor should pick on <i>him</i>
rather than, say, Neville or Hermione. Harry was a lot better able
to defend himself. Yep, probably all for the best.</p>
<p>When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over
the full class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without
stars.</p>
<p>"You are here," Severus said in a quiet voice which the students
at back strained to hear, "to learn the subtle science and exact
art of potionmaking. As there is little foolish wand-waving here,
many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron
with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep
through human veins," this in a rather caressing, gloating tone,
"bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses," this was just getting
creepier and creepier. "I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew
glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as great a pack of fools
as I usually have to teach."</p>
<p>Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on
Harry's face, or at least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry
was sitting.</p>
<p>"Potter!" snapped the Potions professor. "What would I get if I
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "Was that in <i>Magical Drafts and Potions</i>?"
he said. "I just finished reading it, and I don't remember anything
which used wormwood -"</p>
<p>Hermione's hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which caused
her to raise her hand even higher.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut," Severus said silkily. "Fame clearly isn't
everything."</p>
<p>"Really?" Harry said. "But you just told us you'd teach us how
to bottle fame. Say, how <i>does</i> that work, exactly? You drink
it and turn into a celebrity?"</p>
<p>Three-quarters of the class flinched.</p>
<p>Hermione's hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn't
surprising. She might be his rival, but she wasn't the sort of girl
who would play along after it became clear that the professor was
deliberately trying to humiliate him.</p>
<p>Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first
rejoinder that had crossed his mind was 'Abracadabra'.</p>
<p>"Let's try again," said Severus. "Potter, where would you look
if I told you to find me a bezoar?"</p>
<p>"That's not in the textbook either," Harry said, "but in one
Muggle book I read that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified
hair found in a human stomach, and Muggles used to believe it would
cure any poison -"</p>
<p>"Wrong," Severus said. "A bezoar is found in the stomach of a
goat, it is not made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not
all."</p>
<p>"I didn't <i>say</i> it would, I said that was what I read in
one Muggle book -"</p>
<p>"No one here is interested in your <i>pathetic</i> Muggle books.
Final try. What is the difference, Potter, between monksblood and
wolfsbane?"</p>
<p>That did it.</p>
<p>"You know," Harry said icily, "in one of my quite
<i>fascinating</i> Muggle books, they describe a study in which
people managed to make themselves look very smart by asking
questions about random facts that only they knew. Apparently the
onlookers only noticed that the askers knew and the answerers
didn't, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the underlying
game. So, Professor, can you tell me how many electrons are in the
outermost orbital of a carbon atom?"</p>
<p>Severus's smile widened. "Four," he said. "It is a useless fact
which no one should bother writing down, however. And for your
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion
so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. As for
monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes
by the name of aconite, as you would know if you had read <i>One
Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.</i> Thought you didn't need to
open the book before coming, eh, Potter? All the rest of you should
be copying that down so that you will not be as ignorant as him."
Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. "And that will
be... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from
Ravenclaw for backchat."</p>
<p>Hermione gasped, along with a number of others.</p>
<p>"Professor Severus Snape," Harry bit out. "I know of nothing
which I have done to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you
have with me which I do not know about, I suggest we -"</p>
<p>"Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of
you, open your books to page 3."</p>
<p>There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in
the back of Harry's throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If
crying was not an effective strategy for destroying this Potions
professor then there was no point in crying.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have
been drained away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he'd
been trying to keep his temper but he couldn't seem to remember
why.</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over,
"stop, please, it's all right, we won't count it -"</p>
<p>"Talking in class, Granger? Three -"</p>
<p>"So," said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, "how does one go
about filing a formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does
one talk to the Deputy Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of
Governors... would you care to explain how it works?"</p>
<p>The class was utterly frozen.</p>
<p>"Detention for one month, Potter," Severus said, smiling even
more broadly.</p>
<p>"I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will
not serve any detention you give."</p>
<p>People stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Severus's smile vanished. "Then you will be -" his voice stopped
short.</p>
<p>"Expelled, were you about to say?" Harry, on the other hand, was
now smiling thinly. "But then you seemed to doubt your ability to
carry out the threat, or fear the consequences if you did. I, on
the other hand, neither doubt nor fear the prospect of finding a
school with less abusive professors. Or perhaps I should hire
private tutors, as is my accustomed practice, and be taught at my
full learning speed. I have enough money in my vault. Something
about bounties on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there <i>are</i>
teachers at Hogwarts who I rather like, so I think it will be
easier if I find some way to get rid of you instead."</p>
<p>"Get rid of me?" Severus said, now also smiling thinly. "What an
amusing conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?"</p>
<p>"I understand there have been a number of complaints about you
from students and their parents," a guess but a safe one, "which
leaves only the question of why you're not already gone. Is
Hogwarts too financially strapped to afford a real Potions
professor? I could chip in, if so. I'm sure they could find a
better class of teacher if they offered double your current
salary."</p>
<p>Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the
classroom.</p>
<p>"You will find," Severus said softly, "that the Board of
Governers is not the slightest bit sympathetic to your offer."</p>
<p>"Lucius..." Harry said. "<i>That's</i> why you're still here.
Perhaps I should chat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires
to meet with me. I wonder if I have anything he wants?"</p>
<p>Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the
corner of his eye, but his attention was all on Severus.</p>
<p>"You are a very foolish boy," Severus said. He wasn't smiling at
all, now. "You have nothing that Lucius values more than my
friendship. And if you did, I have other allies." His voice grew
hard. "And I find it increasingly unlikely that you were not Sorted
into Slytherin. How was it that you managed to stay out of my
House? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hat claimed it was
<i>joking</i>. For the first time in recorded history. What were
you really <i>chatting</i> about with the Sorting Hat, Potter? Did
you have something that it wanted?"</p>
<p>Harry stared into Severus's cold gaze and remembered that the
Sorting Hat had warned him not to meet anyone's eyes while thinking
about - Harry dropped his gaze to Severus's desk.</p>
<p>"You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!"</p>
<p>A shock of sudden understanding - "So it was <i>you</i> the
Sorting Hat was warning me about!"</p>
<p>"What?" said Severus's voice, sounding genuinely surprised,
though of course Harry didn't look at his face.</p>
<p>Harry got up out of his desk.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Potter," said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn't
looking.</p>
<p>Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. "I have no
intention of letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at
Hogwarts," Harry said with deadly calm. "I think I'll take my leave
of this class, and either hire a tutor to teach me Potions while
I'm here, or if the Board is really that locked up, learn over the
summer. If any of you decide that you don't care to be bullied by
this man, my sessions will be open to you."</p>
<p>"<i>Sit down, Potter!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob.</p>
<p>It didn't turn.</p>
<p>Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus
smiling nastily before he remembered to look away.</p>
<p>"Open this door."</p>
<p>"No," said Severus.</p>
<p>"You are making me feel threatened," said a voice so icy it
didn't sound like Harry's at all, "and that is a mistake."</p>
<p>Severus's voice laughed. "What do you intend to do about it,
little boy?"</p>
<p>Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he
was standing near the back row of desks.</p>
<p>Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in one
terrible motion, fingers poised to snap.</p>
<p>Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrank
back or instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry don't!</i>" shrieked Hermione. "Whatever you were
going to do to him, don't do it!"</p>
<p>"Have you all gone <i>mad?</i>" barked Severus's voice.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. "I wasn't going to hurt him,
Hermione," Harry said, his voice a little lower. "I was just going
to blow up the door."</p>
<p>Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren't supposed to
Transfigure things that were to be burned, which meant that going
back in time afterward and getting Fred or George to Transfigure
some carefully measured amount of explosives might not actually
have been such a good idea...</p>
<p>"<i>Silencio,</i>" said Severus's voice.</p>
<p>Harry tried to say "What?" and found that no sound was coming
out.</p>
<p>"This has become ridiculous. I think you've been allowed to get
yourself in enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most
disruptive and unruly student I have ever seen, and I don't recall
how many points Ravenclaw has right now, but I'm sure I can manage
to wipe them all out. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from
Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw! Fifty points from Ravenclaw!
Now sit down and watch the rest of the class take their
lesson!"</p>
<p>Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say 'marker' but
of course no words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him;
and then it occurred to Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger
motions, which worked. P-A-D and he had a pad of paper. Harry
strode over to an empty desk, not the one he'd originally sat down
in, and scrawled a brief message. He tore off that sheet of paper,
put away the marker and pad in a pocket of his robes for quicker
access, and held up his message, not to Snape, but to the rest of
the class.</p>
<p>I'M LEAVING<br />
DOES ANYONE ELSE<br />
NEED TO GET OUT?</p>
<p>"You're insane, Potter," Severus said with cold contempt.</p>
<p>Aside from that, no one spoke.</p>
<p>Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher's desk, walked over to
the wall, and with one smooth motion yanked open a closet door,
stepped in, and slammed the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, and
then nothing.</p>
<p>In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement
and fear.</p>
<p>The Potions Master's face was now completely enraged. He crossed
the room in terrible strides and yanked open the closet door.</p>
<p>The closet was empty.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>One hour earlier, Harry listened from inside the closed closet.
There was no sound from outside, and no point in taking risks
either.</p>
<p>C-L-O-A-K, his fingers spelled out.</p>
<p>Once he was invisible, he very carefully and slowly cracked open
the closet door and peeked out. No one seemed to be in the
classroom.</p>
<p>The door wasn't locked.</p>
<p>It was when Harry was outside the dangerous place and inside the
hallway, safely invisible, that some of the anger drained away and
he realized what he'd just done.</p>
<p>What he'd just done.</p>
<p>Harry's invisible face was frozen in absolute horror.</p>
<p>He'd antagonized a teacher three orders of magnitude beyond
anything he'd ever managed before. He'd threatened to walk out of
Hogwarts and might have to follow through on it. He'd lost all the
points Ravenclaw had and then he'd used the Time-Turner...</p>
<p>His imagination showed him his parents yelling at him after he
was expelled, Professor McGonagall disappointed in him, and it was
just too painful and he couldn't bear it and he <i>couldn't think
of any way to save himself -</i></p>
<p>The thought that Harry allowed himself to think was that if
getting angry had gotten him into all this trouble, then maybe when
he was angry he'd think of a way out, things seemed clearer somehow
when he was angry.</p>
<p>And the thought that Harry didn't let himself think was that he
just couldn't face this future if he wasn't angry.</p>
<p>So he cast his thoughts back and remembered the burning
humiliation -</p>
<p><i>Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn't everything.</i></p>
<p><i>Ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.</i></p>
<p>The calming cold washed back through his veins like a wave
reflected and returning from some breaker, and Harry let out his
breath.</p>
<p>Okay. Back to being sane now.</p>
<p>He was actually feeling a bit disappointed in his non-angry self
for collapsing like that and wanting only to get out of trouble.
Professor Severus Snape was <i>everyone's</i> problem. Normal-Harry
had forgotten that and wished for a way to protect <i>himself.</i>
And let all the other victims go hang? The question wasn't how to
protect himself, the question was how to destroy this Potions
professor.</p>
<p><i>So this is my dark side, is it?</i> <i>Bit of a prejudiced
term that, my light side seems more selfish and cowardly, not to
mention confused and panicky.</i></p>
<p>And now that he was thinking clearly, it was equally clear what
to do next. He'd already given himself an extra hour to prepare,
and could get up to five hours more if required...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in
four layers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before
him, opposite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them
was an empty wooden stool.</p>
<p>They were waiting for Harry Potter.</p>
<p><i>Harry,</i> Minerva thought despairingly, <i>you promised you
wouldn't bite any teachers!</i></p>
<p>And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry's
angry face and his outraged response: <i>I said I wouldn't bite
anyone who didn't bite me first!</i></p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>"Come in!" Dumbledore called.</p>
<p>The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost
gasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in
control of himself.</p>
<p>"Good mor-" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring
at Fawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes
fluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a
flame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy.</p>
<p>Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Dumbledore winked at him.</p>
<p>Minerva felt she was missing something.</p>
<p>Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry's face. His coolness wavered.
Fear showed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm
again.</p>
<p>A chill went down Minerva's spine. Something was not right
here.</p>
<p>"Please sit down," said Dumbledore. His face was now serious
once more.</p>
<p>Harry sat.</p>
<p>"So, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I've heard one report of this day
from Professor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in
your own words?"</p>
<p>Harry's gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. "It's not
complicated," said the boy, smiling thinly. "He tried bullying me
the way he's been bullying every non-Slytherin in the school since
the day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for the other details, I
request a private conversation with you concerning them. A student
who is reporting abusive behavior from a professor can hardly be
expected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after
all."</p>
<p>This time Minerva couldn't stop herself from gasping out
loud.</p>
<p>Severus simply laughed.</p>
<p>And the Headmaster's face grew grave. "Mr. Potter," the
Headmaster said, "one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in
such terms. I fear that you labor under a terrible misapprehension.
Professor Severus Snape has my fullest confidence, and serves
Hogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy's."</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments.</p>
<p>When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. "Am I missing
something here?"</p>
<p>"Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster.
"You should understand, to start with, that the purpose of this
meeting is to discuss how to discipline you for the events of this
morning."</p>
<p>"This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to
students and collected stories to make sure there would be enough
for a newspaper campaign to rally the parents against him. Some of
the younger students cried while they told me. I almost cried when
I heard them! <i>You allowed this abuser to run free? You did this
to your students? Why?</i>"</p>
<p>Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She'd - thought that,
sometimes, but somehow she'd never quite -</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, "this
meeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your
disregard for school discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and
I have agreed, that three full months of detention will be
appropriate -"</p>
<p>"Declined," Harry said icily.</p>
<p>Minerva was speechless.</p>
<p>"This is not a request, Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said. The
full, entire force of the wizard's gaze was turned on the boy.
"This is your punishme-"</p>
<p>"You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the
children placed in your care, and if your explanation is not
sufficient then I will begin my newspaper campaign with <i>you</i>
as the target."</p>
<p>Minerva's body swayed with the force of that blow, with the
sheer raw <i>lese majeste</i>.</p>
<p>Even Severus looked shocked.</p>
<p>"That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise," Dumbledore said
slowly. "I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard.
For you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did
not think that was your chosen side."</p>
<p>The boy was still for a long moment.</p>
<p>"This conversation grows private," Harry said. His hand flicked
in Severus's direction. "Send him away."</p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head. "Harry, did I not tell you that
Severus Snape has my fullest confidence?"</p>
<p>The boy's face showed the shock of it. "This man's bullying
makes you vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a
newspaper campaign against you! This is insane! Why are you doing
this?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. "I'm sorry, Harry. It has to do with things
that you are not, at this time, ready to hear."</p>
<p>The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus.
Then back to Dumbledore again.</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> insanity," the boy said slowly. "You haven't
reined him in because you think he's <i>part of the pattern</i>.
That Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Master to be a proper magical
school, just as it needs a ghost to teach History."</p>
<p>"That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't it?"
said Dumbledore, smiling.</p>
<p>"Unacceptable," Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and
dark. "I will not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many
possible ways of dealing with this problem, but I will make it
simple. Either this man goes, or I do."</p>
<p>Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus's
eyes.</p>
<p>Now Dumbledore's gaze was also growing cold. "Expulsion, Mr.
Potter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It
is not customarily used as a threat by students against the
Headmaster. This is the best magical school in the entire world,
and an education here is not an opportunity given to everyone. Are
you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without
you?"</p>
<p>And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.</p>
<p>Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn't -</p>
<p>"You forget," Harry said, "that you're not the only one who can
see patterns. <i>This grows private. Now send him</i> -" Harry
flicked a hand at Severus again, and then stopped in mid-sentence
and mid-gesture.</p>
<p>Minerva could see it on Harry's face, the moment when he
remembered.</p>
<p>She'd told him, after all.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, "once again, Severus Snape
has my fullest confidence."</p>
<p>"You told him," whispered the boy. "You utter fool."</p>
<p>Dumbledore didn't react to the insult. "Told him what?"</p>
<p>"That the Dark Lord is alive."</p>
<p>"<i>What in Merlin's name are you on about, Potter?</i>" cried
Severus in tones of sheer astonishment and outrage.</p>
<p>Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. "Oh, so we
<i>are</i> a Slytherin, then," Harry said. "I was starting to
wonder."</p>
<p>And then there was silence.</p>
<p>Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. "Harry, what
<i>are</i> you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Albus," Minerva whispered.</p>
<p>Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall didn't tell me," said Harry's voice,
swiftly and less calm than it had been. "I guessed. I told you, I
can see the patterns too. I guessed, and she controlled her
reaction just as Severus did. But her control fell a shade short of
perfection, and I could tell it was control, not genuine."</p>
<p>"And I told him," said Minerva, her voice trembling a little,
"that you, and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew."</p>
<p>"Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going
around asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn't talk,"
Harry said. The boy chuckled briefly. "I really should have gotten
one of you alone and told you that she told me everything, to see
if you let anything slip. Probably wouldn't have worked, but would
have been worth a shot." The boy smiled again. "Threat's still on
the table and I do expect to be briefed <i>fully</i> at some
point."</p>
<p>Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised
her chin and bore it. She knew it was deserved.</p>
<p>Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as
cold as anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his
brother died. "And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do
not comply with your wishes."</p>
<p>Harry's voice was razor-sharp. "I regret to inform you that you
are not the center of the universe. I'm not threatening to walk out
on magical Britain. I'm threatening to walk out on <i>you</i>. I am
not a meek little Frodo. This is <i>my</i> quest and if you want in
you will play by <i>my</i> rules."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face was still cold. "I am beginning to doubt your
suitability as the hero, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Harry's return gaze was equally icy. "I am beginning to doubt
your suitability as my Gandalf, <i>Mr. Dumbledore</i>. Boromir was
at least a plausible mistake. What is this <i>Nazgul</i> doing in
my Fellowship?"</p>
<p>Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he
was following this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face
away from Harry's field of vision and was smiling.</p>
<p>"I suppose," Dumbledore said slowly, "that from your perspective
it is a reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is
to leave you alone henceforth, will that be the last time this
issue arises, or will I find you here every week with a new
demand?"</p>
<p>"Leave <i>me</i> alone?" Harry's voice was outraged. "I am not
his only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! <i>Have you
forgotten how defenseless children are? How much they hurt?</i>
Henceforth Severus will treat <i>every</i> student of Hogwarts with
appropriate and professional courtesy, or you will find another
Potions Master, or you will find another hero!"</p>
<p>Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous
laughter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of
him.</p>
<p>Minerva didn't dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that
Severus was equally motionless.</p>
<p>Harry's visage grew even colder. "You mistake me, Headmaster, if
you think that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your
punishment."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter -" Minerva said. She didn't even know what she was
going to say. She simply couldn't let that go by.</p>
<p>Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to
Dumbledore. "And if that seems impolite to you," Harry said, his
voice now a little less hard, "it seemed no less impolite when you
said it to me. You would not say such a thing to anyone who you
considered a real human being instead of a subordinate child, and I
will treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me -"</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there
was one! Of <i>course</i> you're in here blackmailing me to save
your fellow students, not to save yourself! I can't imagine why I
would have thought otherwise!" Dumbledore was now laughing even
harder. He pounded his fist on the desk three times.</p>
<p>Harry's gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her,
addressing her for the first time. "Excuse me," Harry said. His
voice seemed to be wavering. "Does he need to take his medication
or something?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in
his eyes. "Pardon me. I'm sorry for the interruption. Please
continue with the blackmail."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a
little unsteady. "Ah... he's also to stop reading students'
minds."</p>
<p>"Minerva," Severus said, his voice deadly, "you -"</p>
<p>"Sorting Hat warned me," said Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>
<p>"Can't say anything else. Anyway I think that's it. I'm
done."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Now what?" Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one
else was going to say anything.</p>
<p>"Now what?" Dumbledore echoed. "Why, now the hero wins, of
course."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.</p>
<p>"Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,"
Dumbledore said, smiling happily. "But Hogwarts <i>does</i> need an
evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn't be a proper magical
school, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful
toward students in their fifth year and higher?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said all three of them again.</p>
<p>"If it's the most vulnerable victims about whom you're
concerned. Maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe I <i>have</i> forgotten
over the decades what it's like to be a child. So let's compromise.
Severus will continue to unfairly award points to Slytherin and
impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be awful to
non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To others he
will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only read minds
when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will have its
evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as you put
it, will be safe."</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she'd ever been in her
life. She glanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left
completely neutral, as though he couldn't decide what sort of
expression he ought to be wearing.</p>
<p>"I suppose that is acceptable," Harry said. His voice sounded a
bit odd.</p>
<p>"You can't be serious," Severus said, his voice as
expressionless as his face.</p>
<p>"I am very much in favor of this," Minerva said slowly. She was
so much in favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her
robes. "But what could we possibly tell the students? They might
not have questioned this while Severus was... being awful to
everyone, but -"</p>
<p>"Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible
secret of Severus's and did a bit of blackmail," said Dumbledore.
"It's true, after all; he discovered that Severus was reading
minds, and he certainly did blackmail us."</p>
<p>"This is insanity!" exploded Severus.</p>
<p>"Bwah ha ha!" said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Ah..." said Harry uncertainly. "And if anyone asks me why fifth
years and above got shafted? I wouldn't blame them for being irate,
and that part wasn't exactly my idea -"</p>
<p>"Tell them," said Dumbledore, "that it wasn't you who suggested
the compromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to
say anything more. That, too, is true. There's an art to it, you'll
pick it up with practice."</p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly. "And the points he took from
Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>"They must not be given back."</p>
<p>It was Minerva who said it.</p>
<p>Harry looked at her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," she said. She <i>was</i> sorry, but it
had to be done. "There <i>must</i> be some consequences for your
misbehavior or this school will fall to pieces."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Acceptable," he said flatly. "But in the future
Severus will not strike at my House connections by taking points
from me, nor will he waste my valuable time with detentions. Should
he feel that my behavior requires correction, he may communicate
his concerns to Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>"Harry," Minerva said, "will you continue to submit to school
discipline, or are you to be above the law now, as Severus
was?"</p>
<p>Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly
before it was quashed. "I will continue to be an ordinary student
to every member of the staff who is not insane or evil, provided
that they do not come under pressure from others who are." Harry
glanced briefly at Severus, then turned back to Dumbledore. "Leave
Minerva alone, and I'll be a regular Hogwarts student in her
presence. No special privileges or immunities."</p>
<p>"Beautiful," Dumbledore said sincerely. "Spoken like a true
hero."</p>
<p>"And," she said, "Mr. Potter must publicly apologize for his
actions of today."</p>
<p>Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical.</p>
<p>"The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your
actions, Mr. Potter," Minerva said. "It must be restored."</p>
<p>"I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably
overestimate the importance of what you call school discipline, as
compared to having History taught by a live teacher or not
torturing your students. Maintaining the current status hierarchy
and enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise and moral and
important when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than when
you are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if
required. I could go on for several hours about this point, but I
will leave it at that."</p>
<p>Minerva shook her head. "Mr. Potter, you underestimate the
importance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself
-" She paused. That hadn't come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore,
and even Harry were giving her strange looks. "To learn, I mean.
Not every child can learn in the absence of authority. And it is
the other children who will be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they see your
example as one to be followed."</p>
<p>Harry's lips curved into a twisted smile. "The first and last
resort is the truth. The truth is that I shouldn't have gotten
angry, I shouldn't have disrupted the class, I shouldn't have done
what I did, and I set a bad example for everyone. The truth is also
that Severus Snape behaved in a fashion unbecoming a Hogwarts
professor, and that from now on he will be more mindful of the
injured feelings of students in their fourth year and under. The
two of us could both get up and speak the truth. I could live with
that."</p>
<p>"In your dreams, Potter!" spat Severus.</p>
<p>"After all," said Harry, smiling grimly, "if the students see
that rules are for <i>everyone...</i> for professors too, not just
for poor helpless students who get nothing but suffering out of the
system... why, the positive effects on school discipline should be
<i>tremendous.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. "Minerva
is thinking that you're righter than you have any right to be."</p>
<p>Harry's gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor.
"Are <i>you</i> reading <i>her</i> mind?"</p>
<p>"Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency," said
Dumbledore. "I shall talk over this matter with Severus, and no
apology will be required from you unless he apologizes as well. And
now I declare this matter concluded, at least until lunchtime." He
paused. "Although, Harry, I'm afraid that Minerva wished to speak
with you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of
any pressure on my part. Minerva, if you would?"</p>
<p>Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too much
adrenaline in her blood, her heart was beating too fast.</p>
<p>"Fawkes," said Dumbledore, "accompany her, please."</p>
<p>"I don't -" she started to say.</p>
<p>Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent.</p>
<p>The phoenix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flame
leaping out, and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth
through her robes, all through her body.</p>
<p>"Please follow me, Mr. Potter," she said, firmly now, and they
left through the door.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>They stood on the rotating stairs, descending in silence.</p>
<p>Minerva didn't know what to say. She didn't know this person who
stood beside her.</p>
<p>And Fawkes began to croon.</p>
<p>It was tender, and soft, like a fireplace would sound if it had
melody, and it washed over Minerva's mind, easing, soothing,
gentling what it touched...</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> is <i>that?</i>" Harry whispered beside her. His
voice was unstable, wobbling, changing pitch.</p>
<p>"The song of the phoenix," said Minerva, not really aware of
what she was saying, her attention was all on that strange quiet
music. "It, too, heals."</p>
<p>Harry turned his face from her, but she caught a glimpse of
something agonized.</p>
<p>The descent seemed to take a very long time, or maybe it was
only that the music seemed to take a very long time, and when they
stepped out through the gap where a gargoyle had been, she was
holding Harry's hand firmly in hers.</p>
<p>As the gargoyle stepped back into place, Fawkes left her
shoulder, and swooped to hover in front of Harry.</p>
<p>Harry stared at Fawkes like someone hypnotized by the
ever-changing light of a fire.</p>
<p>"What am I to do, Fawkes?" whispered Harry. "I couldn't have
protected them if I hadn't been angry."</p>
<p>The phoenix's wings continued flapping, it continued hovering in
place. There was no sound but the beating of the wings. Then there
was a flash like a fire flaring up and going out, and Fawkes was
gone.</p>
<p>Both of them blinked, like waking up from a dream, or maybe like
falling asleep again.</p>
<p>Minerva looked down.</p>
<p>Harry Potter's bright young face looked up at her.</p>
<p>"Are phoenixes people?" said Harry. "I mean, are they smart
enough to count as people? Could I talk with Fawkes if I knew
how?"</p>
<p>Minerva blinked hard. Then she blinked again. "No," Minerva
said, her voice wavering. "Phoenixes are creatures of powerful
magic. That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which
no simple animal could possess. They are fire, light, healing,
rebirth. But in the end, no."</p>
<p>"Where can I get one?"</p>
<p>Minerva leaned down and hugged him. She hadn't meant to, but she
didn't seem to have much choice in the matter.</p>
<p>When she stood up she found it hard to speak. But she had to
ask. "What happened today, Harry?"</p>
<p>"I don't know the answers to any of the important questions
either. Aside from that I'd really rather not think about it for a
while."</p>
<p>Minerva took his hand in hers again, and they walked the rest of
the way in silence.</p>
<p>It was only a short trip, since naturally the office of the
Deputy was close to the office of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Minerva sat behind her desk.</p>
<p>Harry sat in front of her desk.</p>
<p>"So," Minerva whispered. She would have given almost anything
not to do this, or not to be the one who had to do it, or for it to
be any time but right now. "There is a matter of school discipline.
From which you are not exempt."</p>
<p>"Namely?" said Harry.</p>
<p>He didn't know. He hadn't figured it out yet. She felt her
throat tighten. But there was work to be done and she would not
shirk it.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I need to see your
Time-Turner, please."</p>
<p>All the peace of the phoenix vanished from his face in an
instant and Minerva felt like she had just stabbed him.</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" Harry said. His voice was panicked. "I need it, I
won't be able to attend Hogwarts, I won't be able to sleep!"</p>
<p>"You'll be able to sleep," she said. "The Ministry has delivered
the protective shell for your Time-Turner. I will enchant it to
open only between the hours of 9PM and midnight."</p>
<p>Harry's face twisted. "But - but I -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, how many times have you used the Time-Turner since
Monday? How many hours?"</p>
<p>"I..." Harry said. "Hold on, let me add it up -" He glanced down
at his watch.</p>
<p>Minerva felt a rush of sadness. She'd thought so. "It wasn't
just two per day, then. I suspect that if I asked your dormmates, I
would find that you were struggling to stay up long enough to go to
sleep at a reasonable time, and waking up earlier and earlier every
morning. Correct?"</p>
<p>Harry's face said everything she needed to know.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," she said gently, "there are students who cannot be
entrusted with Time-Turners, because they become addicted to them.
We give them a potion which lengthens their sleep cycle by the
necessary amount, but they end up using the Time-Turner for more
than just attending their classes. And so we must take them back.
Mr. Potter, you have taken to using the Time-Turner as your
solution to everything, often very foolishly so. You used it to get
back a Remembrall. You vanished from a closet in a fashion apparent
to other students, instead of going back after you were out and
getting me or someone else to come and open the door."</p>
<p>From the look on Harry's face he hadn't thought of that.</p>
<p>"And more importantly," she said, "you should have simply sat in
Professor Snape's class. And watched. And left at the end of class.
As you would have done if you had not possessed a Time-Turner.
There are some students who cannot be entrusted with Time-Turners,
Mr. Potter. You are one of them. I am sorry."</p>
<p>"But I <i>need</i> it!" Harry blurted. "What if there are
Slytherins threatening me and I have to escape? It keeps me
<i>safe</i> -"</p>
<p>"Every other student in this castle runs the same risk, and I
assure you that they survive. No student has died in this castle
for fifty years. Mr. Potter, you will hand over your Time-Turner
and do so now."</p>
<p>Harry's face twisted in agony, but he drew out the Time-Turner
from under his robes and gave it to her.</p>
<p>From her desk, Minerva drew out one of the protective shells
that had been sent to Hogwarts. She snapped the cover into place
around the Time-Turner's turning hourglass, and then she laid her
wand on the cover to complete the enchantment.</p>
<p>"<i>This isn't fair!</i>" Harry shrieked. "I saved half of
Hogwarts from Professor Snape today, is it right that I be punished
for it? I saw the look on your face, you <i>hated</i> what he was
doing!"</p>
<p>Minerva didn't speak for a few moments. She was enchanting.</p>
<p>When she finished and looked up, she knew that her face was
stern. Maybe it was the wrong thing to do. And then again maybe it
was the right thing to do. There was an obstinate child in front of
her, and that <i>didn't</i> mean the universe was broken.</p>
<p>"<i>Fair,</i> Mr. Potter?" she snapped. "I have had to file
<i>two reports</i> with the Ministry on public use of a Time-Turner
in <i>two successive days!</i> Be <i>extremely</i> grateful you
were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in restricted form! The
Headmaster made a Floo call to plead with them personally and if
you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would not have
sufficed!"</p>
<p>Harry gaped at her.</p>
<p>She knew that he was seeing the angry face of Professor
McGonagall.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes filled up with tears.</p>
<p>"I'm, sorry," he whispered, voice now choked and broken. "I'm
sorry, to have, disappointed you..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry too, Mr. Potter," she said sternly, and handed him
the newly restricted Time-Turner. "You may go."</p>
<p>Harry turned and fled from her office, sobbing. She heard his
feet pattering away down the hall, and then the sound cut off as
the door swung closed.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry too, Harry," she whispered to the quiet room. "I'm
sorry too."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Fifteen minutes into lunch hour.</p>
<p>No one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were
shooting him looks of anger, others of sympathy, a few of the
youngest students even had looks of admiration, but no one was
talking to him. Even Hermione hadn't tried to come over.</p>
<p>Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn't said
anything. The offer was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told
them that he would come over when dessert started, no earlier. They
had nodded and quickly walked away.</p>
<p>It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry's face
that was doing it.</p>
<p>The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay.
They knew, because they'd seen Flitwick come and get him, that he'd
been called to the Headmaster's office.</p>
<p>Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would
start laughing, and if he started laughing, he wouldn't stop until
the nice people in white jackets came to haul him away.</p>
<p>It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone
over to the Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in
retrospect insane, his dark side had won an impossible victory that
might have been real and might have been a pure whim of a crazy
Headmaster, his dark side had protected his friends. He just
couldn't handle it any more. He needed Fawkes to sing to him again.
He needed to use the Time-Turner to go off and take a quiet hour to
recover but that wasn't an option any more and the loss was like a
hole in his existence but he couldn't think about that because then
he might start laughing.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch had
arrived, almost none had departed.</p>
<p>The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall.</p>
<p>"If I may have your attention please," Dumbledore said. "Harry
Potter has something he would like to share with us."</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the Head
Table, with every eye staring at him.</p>
<p>Harry turned and looked out at the four tables.</p>
<p>It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept
his face expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized
speech.</p>
<p>"The truth is sacred," Harry said tonelessly. "One of my most
treasured possessions is a button which reads 'Speak the truth,
even if your voice trembles'. This, then, is the truth. Remember
that. I am not saying it because I am being forced to say it, I am
saying it because it is true. What I did in Professor Snape's class
was foolish, stupid, childish, and an inexcusable violation of the
rules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroom and deprived my fellow
students of their irreplaceable learning time. All because I failed
to control my temper. I hope that not a single one of you will ever
follow my example. I certainly intend to try never to follow it
again."</p>
<p>Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy
looks upon their faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking
the loss of a fallen champion. At the younger parts of the
Gryffindor table the look was almost universal.</p>
<p>Until Harry raised his hand.</p>
<p>He did not raise it high. That might have appeared preemptory.
He certainly did not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised
his hand to chest level, and softly snapped his fingers, a gesture
that was seen more than heard. It was possible that most of the
Head Table wouldn't see it at all.</p>
<p>This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from the
younger students and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers from
Slytherin, and frowns and worried looks from all others.</p>
<p>Harry kept his face expressionless. "Thank you," he said.
"That's all."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster. "And now Professor
Snape has something to share with us as well."</p>
<p>Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. "It
has been brought to my attention," he said, "that my own actions
played a part in provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr.
Potter, and in the ensuing discussion I realized that I had
forgotten how easily injured are the feelings of the young and
immature -"</p>
<p>There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at
the same time.</p>
<p>Severus continued as if he had not heard. "The Potions classroom
is a dangerous place, and I still feel that strict discipline is
necessary, but henceforth I will be more aware of the... emotional
fragility... of students in their fourth year and younger. My
deduction of points from Ravenclaw still stands, but I will revoke
Mr. Potter's detention. Thank you."</p>
<p>There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and
faster than lightning Severus's wand was in his hand and
"<i>Quietus!</i>" silenced the offender.</p>
<p>"I will still demand discipline and respect in <i>all</i> my
classes," Severus said coldly, "and anyone who trifles with me will
regret it."</p>
<p>He sat down.</p>
<p>"Thank you too!" Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. "Carry
on!"</p>
<p>And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat
in Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly
identifiable in the beginning. The first was an initial "What -"
beginning many different sentences such as "What just happened -"
and "What the hell -" The second was "<i>Scourgify!</i>" as
students cleaned up the dropped food and spit-out drinks from
themselves, the tablecloth, and each other.</p>
<p>Some students were weeping openly. So was Professor Sprout.</p>
<p>At the Gryffindor table, where a cake waited with fifty-one
unlit candles, Fred whispered, "I think we may be out of our league
here, George."</p>
<p>And from that day onward, no matter what Hermione tried to tell
anyone, it would be an accepted legend of Hogwarts that Harry
Potter could make absolutely anything happen by snapping his
fingers.</p>

<p>Draco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmed
robes somehow looked far more formal, serious, and well-turned-out
than the same exact robes as worn by the two boys behind him.</p>
<p>"Talk," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Yeah! Talk!"</p>
<p>"You heard da boss! Talk!"</p>
<p>"You two, on the other hand, <i>shut up.</i>"</p>
<p>The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in
that vast auditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er,
Battle Magic.</p>
<p>The last session of classes on Friday.</p>
<p>Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and
that the brilliant Professor Quirrell would realize this was
perhaps not the best time to single out Harry for anything. Harry
had recovered a little, but...</p>
<p>...but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of
stress relief first.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great
solemnity upon Draco and his minions.</p>
<p>"You ask, what is our aim?" Harry declaimed. "I can answer in
one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of
all terrors - Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for
without victory there is no -"</p>
<p>"<i>Talk about Snape,</i>" Draco hissed. "<i>What did you
do?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more
serious look.</p>
<p>"You saw it," Harry said. "Everyone saw it. I snapped my
fingers."</p>
<p>"<i>Harry! Stop teasing me!</i>"</p>
<p>So he'd been promoted to <i>Harry</i> now. Interesting. And in
fact Harry was fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and
feel bad if he didn't respond somehow...</p>
<p>Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the
minions.</p>
<p>"They won't talk," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, "I'm going to be one hundred percent honest
here and say that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with
Mr. Goyle's cunning."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle winced.</p>
<p>"Me neither," said Draco. "I explained to him that I ended up
owing you a favor because of it." (Mr. Goyle winced again.) "But
there <i>is</i> a big difference between that sort of mistake and
being indiscreet. That really is something they've been trained
from childhood to understand."</p>
<p>"All right then," Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though
the background noises had gone to blurs in Draco's presence. "I
deduced one of Severus's secrets and did a bit of blackmail."</p>
<p>Draco's expression hardened. "Good, now tell me something you
didn't tell in strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor,
meaning that was the story you <i>wanted</i> to get all over the
school."</p>
<p>Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught
it.</p>
<p>"What is Severus saying?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"That he hadn't realized how sensitive the feelings of young
children were," Draco said. "Even in Slytherin! Even to
<i>me!</i>"</p>
<p>"Are you sure," Harry said, "that you want to know something
your Head of House would rather you not know?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Draco said without hesitation.</p>
<p><i>Interesting.</i> "Then you really are going to send your
minions away first, because I'm not sure I can believe everything
you believe about them."</p>
<p>Draco nodded. "Okay."</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked <i>very</i> unhappy. "Boss -"
said Mr. Crabbe.</p>
<p>"You've given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you," Draco said.
"Go!"</p>
<p>They left.</p>
<p>"In particular," Harry said, lowering his voice even further,
"I'm not <i>entirely</i> sure that they wouldn't just report what I
said to Lucius."</p>
<p>"Father wouldn't <i>do</i> that!" Draco said, looking genuinely
aghast. "They're <i>mine!</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said. "I'm just not sure I can believe
everything you believe about your father. Imagine it was your
secret and me telling you my father wouldn't do that."</p>
<p>Draco nodded slowly. "You're right. <i>I'm</i> sorry, Harry. It
was wrong of me to ask it of you."</p>
<p><i>How did I get</i> this <i>promoted? Shouldn't he hate me
now?</i> Harry had the feeling he was looking at something
exploitable... he just wished his brain wasn't so exhausted.
Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand at some complicated
plotting.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said. "Trade. I tell you a fact that isn't on
the grapevine, and does not <i>go</i> on the grapevine, and in
<i>particular</i> does not go to your father, and in return you
tell me what you and Slytherin think about the whole business."</p>
<p>"Deal!"</p>
<p>Now to make this as vague as possible... something that wouldn't
hurt much even if it did get out... "What I said was true. I did
discover one of Severus's secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But
Severus wasn't the only person involved."</p>
<p>"<i>I knew it!</i>" Draco said exultantly.</p>
<p>Harry's stomach sank. He had apparently said something very
significant and he did not know why. This was not a good sign.</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. He was grinning widely now. "So here's
what the reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were
like, 'We hate Harry Potter! Let's go beat him up!'"</p>
<p>Harry choked. "What is <i>wrong</i> with the Sorting Hat? That's
not Slytherin, it's <i>Gryffindor</i> -"</p>
<p>"Not all children are prodigies," Draco said, though he was
smiling in a sort of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest
that he privately agreed with Harry's opinion. "And it took around
fifteen seconds for someone to explain to them why this might not
be such a favor to Snape, so you're fine. Anyway, after that was
the second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, 'Looks like
Harry Potter was just another do-gooder after all.'"</p>
<p>"And then?" Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why
<i>that</i> was stupid.</p>
<p>"And then the actual smart people started talking. It's obvious
that you found a way to put a <i>lot</i> of pressure on Snape. And
while that could be more than one thing... the obvious <i>next</i>
thought is that it has something to do with Snape's unknown hold
over Dumbledore. Am I right?"</p>
<p>"No comment," Harry said. At least his brain was processing this
part correctly. House Slytherin <i>had</i> wondered why Severus
wasn't getting fired. And they'd concluded that Severus was
blackmailing Dumbledore. Could that actually be true...? But
Dumbledore hadn't seemed to act like it...</p>
<p>Draco went on talking. "And the <i>next</i> thing the smart
people pointed out was that if you could put enough pressure on
Snape to make him leave half of Hogwarts alone, that meant you
probably had enough power to get rid of him entirely, if you
wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same way he
tried to humiliate you - but you left us our Head of House."</p>
<p>Harry made his smile wider.</p>
<p>"And then the <i>really</i> smart people," Draco said, his face
now serious, "went off and had a little discussion by themselves,
and someone pointed out that it would be a very stupid thing to
leave an enemy around like that. If you could break his hold over
Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it. Dumbledore
would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him killed,
he'd be <i>very</i> grateful to you, and you wouldn't have to worry
about Snape sneaking into your dorm room at night with interesting
potions."</p>
<p>Harry's face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he
really, really should have. "And from this you concluded...?"</p>
<p>"Snape's hold was some secret of Dumbledore's and <i>you've got
the secret!</i>" Draco was looking exultant. "It can't be powerful
enough to destroy Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have used it
by now. Snape refuses to use his hold for anything except staying
king of Slytherin House in Hogwarts, and he doesn't always get what
he wants even then, so it must have limits. But it's <i>got</i> to
be really good! Father's been trying to get Snape to tell him for
<i>years!</i>"</p>
<p>"And," Harry said, "now Lucius thinks maybe <i>I</i> can tell
him. Did you already get an owl -"</p>
<p>"I will tonight," Draco said, and laughed. "It will say," his
voice took on a different, more formal cadence, "<i>My beloved son:
I've already told you of Harry Potter's potential importance. As
you have already realized, his importance has now become greater
and more urgent. If you see any possible avenue of friendship or
point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the full
resources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.</i>"</p>
<p>Gosh. "Well," Harry said, "not commenting on whether or not your
whole complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that
we are not quite such good friends as yet."</p>
<p>"I know," Draco said. Then his face turned <i>very</i> serious,
and his voice grew quiet even within the blur. "Harry, has it
occurred to you that if you know something Dumbledore doesn't want
known, Dumbledore might simply have you killed? And it would turn
the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader into a valuable
martyr, too."</p>
<p>"No comment," Harry said yet again. He hadn't thought of that
last part, either. Didn't <i>seem</i> to be Dumbledore's style...
but...</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said, "you've obviously got <i>incredible</i>
talent, but you've got no training and no mentors and you do stupid
things sometimes and <i>you really need an advisor who knows how to
do this or you're going to get hurt!</i>" Draco's face was
fierce.</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "An advisor like Lucius?"</p>
<p>"Like <i>me!</i>" said Draco. "I'll promise to keep your
secrets from Father, from <i>everyone,</i> I'll just help you
figure out whatever you want to do!"</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the
doors.</p>
<p>"Class is about to start," said Harry. "I'll think about what
you said, there's lots of times I <i>do</i> wish I had all your
training, it's just I don't know how I can trust you so quickly
-"</p>
<p>"You shouldn't," Draco said, "it's too soon. See? I'll give you
good advice even if it hurts me. But we should maybe <i>hurry
up</i> and become closer friends."</p>
<p>"I'm open to that," said Harry, who was already trying to figure
out how to exploit it.</p>
<p>"Another bit of advice," Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell
slouched toward his desk, "right now everyone in Slytherin's
wondering about you, so if you're courting us, which I think you
are, you should do something that signals friendship to Slytherin.
<i>Soon</i>, like today or tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin
wasn't enough?" No reason Harry couldn't take credit for it.</p>
<p>Draco's eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly,
"It's not the same, trust me, it's got to be something obvious.
Push your mudblood rival Granger into a wall or something, everyone
in Slytherin will know what that means -"</p>
<p>"That is <i>not</i> how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you
have to push someone into a wall it means your brain is too
<i>weak</i> to beat them the right way and everyone in Ravenclaw
<i>knows that</i> -"</p>
<p>The screen on Harry's desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash
of nostalgia for television and computers.</p>
<p>"Ahem," said Professor Quirrell's voice, seeming to speak
personally to Harry out of the screen. "Please take your
seats."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater
screens on their desks, or looking down directly at the great white
marble stage where Professor Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk
atop the small dais of darker marble.</p>
<p>"Today," said Professor Quirrell, "I had planned to teach you
your first defensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of
today's <i>Protego.</i> But on second thought I have changed
today's lesson plan in the light of recent events."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry
winced from where he was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling
he knew who was about to be called on.</p>
<p>"Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>"Yes, Professor?" said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming
to come from the repeater screen on Harry's desk, which showed
Draco's face as he spoke. Then the screen shifted back to Professor
Quirrell, who said:</p>
<p>"Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?"</p>
<p>"That's an odd question, Professor," said Draco. "I mean, who'd
be dumb enough to admit it?"</p>
<p>A few students laughed, but not many.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "So while there's no point in
asking any of you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if
there were a student or two in my classes who harbored ambitions of
being the next Dark Lord. After all, <i>I</i> wanted to be the next
Dark Lord when <i>I</i> was a young Slytherin."</p>
<p>This time the laughter was much more widespread.</p>
<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> the House of the ambitious, after all,"
Professor Quirrell said, smiling. "I didn't realize until later
that what I really enjoyed was Battle Magic, and that my true
ambition was to become a great fighting wizard and someday teach at
Hogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteen years old, I read
through the historical sections of the Hogwarts library,
scrutinizing the lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a
list of all the mistakes that <i>I</i> would never make when
<i>I</i> was a Dark Lord -"</p>
<p>Harry giggled before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess
what was the very first item on that list?"</p>
<p><i>Great.</i> "Um... never use a complicated way of dealing with
an enemy when you can just Abracadabra them?"</p>
<p>"The <i>term,</i> Mr. Potter, is <i>Avada Kedavra,</i>"
Professor Quirrell's voice sounded a bit sharp for some reason,
"and no, that was <i>not</i> on the list I made at age thirteen.
Would you care to guess again?"</p>
<p>"Ah... never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell laughed. "Ah, now <i>that</i> was number two.
My, Mr. Potter, have we been reading the same books?"</p>
<p>There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harry
clenched his jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would
accomplish nothing.</p>
<p>"But no. The <i>first</i> item was, 'I will not go around
provoking strong, vicious enemies.' The history of the world would
be very different if Mornelithe Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped
that elementary point. Now <i>if,</i> Mr. Potter - just <i>if</i>
by some chance you harbor an ambition similar to the one I held as
a young Slytherin - even so, I hope it is not your ambition to
become a <i>stupid</i> Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, gritting his teeth, "I am a
<i>Ravenclaw</i> and it is not my ambition to be stupid, period. I
know that what I did today was dumb. But it wasn't <i>Dark!</i> I
was <i>not</i> the one who threw the first punch in that
fight!"</p>
<p>"You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age.
Thus I anticipated your answer and altered today's lesson plan
accordingly. Mr. Gregory Goyle, if you would come forward,
please?"</p>
<p>There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn't been
expecting that.</p>
<p>Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather
uncertain and worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached
the dais.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on the
desk. He looked suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and
he drew himself up into a clearly recognizable martial arts
stance.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle
had been called up.</p>
<p>"Most wizards," Professor Quirrell said, "do not bother much
with what a Muggle would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger
than a fist? This attitude is stupid. Wands are held in fists. If
you want to be a great fighting wizard you <i>must</i> learn
martial arts to a level which would impress even a Muggle. I will
now demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I
learned in a <i>dojo,</i> a Muggle school of martial arts, of which
I shall speak more shortly. For now..." Professor Quirrell took
several steps forward, still in stance, advancing on where Mr.
Goyle stood. "Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to attack me."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as
the professor's was, "can I ask what level -"</p>
<p>"Sixth <i>dan</i>. You will not be hurt and neither will I. And
if you see an opening, please take it."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.</p>
<p>"Note," Professor Quirrell said, "that Mr. Goyle was afraid to
attack someone who did not know martial arts to an acceptable
level, for fear that I, or he, would be hurt. Mr. Goyle's attitude
is exactly correct and he has earned three Quirrell points for it.
Now, fight!"</p>
<p>The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor
blocked every blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle
blocked and spun and tried to trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and
Quirrell hopped over it and it was all happening too fast for Harry
to make sense of what was going on and then Goyle was on his back
with his legs pushing and Quirrell was actually <i>flying through
the air</i> and then he hit the ground shoulder first and
rolled.</p>
<p>"Stop!" cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a
little panicked. "You win!"</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping and
falling from the aborted momentum of his headlong charge toward
Professor Quirrell. His face showed utter shock.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using
a peculiar springing motion that made no use of his hands.</p>
<p>There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total
confusion.</p>
<p>"Mr. Goyle," said Professor Quirrell, "what vitally important
technique did I demonstrate?"</p>
<p>"How to fall correctly when someone throws you," said Mr. Goyle.
"It's one of the very first lessons you learn -"</p>
<p>"That too," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"The vitally important technique which I demonstrated," said
Professor Quirrell, "was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank
you."</p>
<p>Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered.
Harry felt the same way.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning
on it. "Sometimes we forget the most basic things, since it has
been too long since we learned them. I realized I had done the same
with my own lesson plan. You do not teach students to throw until
you have taught them to fall. And I must not teach you to fight if
you do not understand how to lose."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a
hint of pain, a touch of sorrow, in those eyes. "I learned how to
lose in a <i>dojo</i> in Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is where
all the good martial artists live. This <i>dojo</i> taught a style
which had a reputation among fighting wizards as adapting well to
magical dueling. The Master of that <i>dojo</i> - an old man by
Muggle standards - was that style's greatest living teacher. He had
no idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study there,
and was one of the few students accepted that year, from among many
contenders. There might have been a tiny bit of special influence
involved."</p>
<p>There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn't share it.
That hadn't been right at all.</p>
<p>"In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been
beaten in a particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and
attacked my sparring partner -"</p>
<p><i>Yikes.</i></p>
<p>"- thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master,
surprisingly, did not expel me on the spot. But he told me that
there was a flaw in my temperament. He explained it to me, and I
knew that he was right. And then he said that I would learn how to
lose."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face was expressionless.</p>
<p>"Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the <i>dojo</i>
lined up. One by one, they approached me. I was <i>not</i> to
defend myself. I was only to beg for mercy. One by one, they
slapped me, or punched me, and pushed me to the ground. Some of
them spat on me. They called me awful names in their language. And
to each one, I had to say, 'I lose!' and similar such things, such
as 'I beg you to stop!' and 'I admit you're better than me!'"</p>
<p>Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was
no way something like that could have happened to the dignified
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic
alone I could have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I
learned to lose. To this day I remember it as one of the most
unpleasant hours of my life. And when I left that dojo eight months
later - which was not nearly enough time, but was all I could
afford to spend - the Master told me that he hoped I understood why
that had been necessary. And I told him that it was one of the most
valuable lessons I had ever learned. Which was, and is, true."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face turned bitter. "You are wondering
where this marvelous <i>dojo</i> is, and whether you can study
there. You cannot. For not long afterward, another would-be student
came to that hidden place, to that remote mountain.
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."</p>
<p>There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in
simultaneously. Harry felt sick to his stomach. He knew what was
coming.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise,
glowing red eyes and all. The students tried to bar his way and he
simply Apparated through. There was terror there, but discipline,
and the Master came forth. And the Dark Lord demanded - not asked,
but demanded - to be taught."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's face was very hard. "Perhaps the Master had
read too many books telling the lie that a true martial artist
could defeat even demons. For whatever reason, the Master refused.
The Dark Lord asked why he could not be a student. The Master told
him he had no patience, and that was when the Dark Lord ripped his
tongue out."</p>
<p>There was a collective gasp.</p>
<p>"You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush
the Dark Lord and fell over, stunned where they stood. And
then..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice faltered for a moment, then
resumed.</p>
<p>"There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which
produces unbearable pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer
than a few minutes it produces permanent insanity. One by one, the
Dark Lord Crucioed the Master's students into insanity, and then
finished them off with the Killing Curse, while the Master was
forced to watch. When all his students had died in this way, the
Master followed. I learned this from the single surviving student,
whom the Dark Lord had left alive to tell the tale, and who had
been a friend of mine..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a moment
later, he once again seemed calm and composed.</p>
<p>"Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers," Professor Quirrell
said quietly. "It is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and
anyone who makes a habit of fighting them soon learns to rely on
it. Understand that the Dark Lord did <i>not</i> win that day. His
goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a single
lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wish that story retold. It did
not show his strength, but rather an exploitable weakness."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's gaze focused on a single child in the
classroom.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>"What <i>precisely</i> did you do wrong today, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry felt like he was going to throw up. "I lost my
temper."</p>
<p>"That is <i>not</i> precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I will
describe it more exactly. There are many animals which have what
are called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns -
trying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight
with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why with their claws
sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a
better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe
their claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest
with a winner and a loser, both of them might be severely
hurt."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry
from the repeater screen. "What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter,
is that - unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and
accept the results - you do not know how to lose a dominance
contest. When a <i>Hogwarts professor</i> challenged you, you did
not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed
your claws, heedless of the danger. You <i>escalated,</i> and then
you escalated <i>again.</i> It started with a slap at you from
Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead of
losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw. Soon
you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you
escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won
at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot."</p>
<p>"I understand," Harry said. His throat was dry. That <i>had</i>
been precise. <i>Frighteningly</i> precise. Now that Professor
Quirrell had said it, Harry could see in hindsight that it was an
<i>exactly</i> accurate description of what had happened. When
someone's model of you was that good, you had to wonder whether
they were right about other things too, like your intent to
kill.</p>
<p>"The <i>next</i> time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a
contest rather than lose, you may lose <i>all</i> the stakes you
place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can
guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House
points."</p>
<p>Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.</p>
<p>''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts,
a much more important goal worthy of great risks. That is a
<i>lie.</i> If you had been -"</p>
<p>"I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best
possible time to make my move," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "But
that would have meant <i>losing</i>. Letting him be dominant over
me. It was what the Dark Lord couldn't do with the Master he wanted
to learn from."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see that you have understood
perfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to
lose."</p>
<p>"I -"</p>
<p>"I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both
that you need this and that you are strong enough to take it. I
assure you that your experience will not be so harsh as what I went
through, though you may well remember it as the worst fifteen
minutes of your young life."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. "Professor Quirrell," he said in a small voice,
"can we do this some other time?"</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said simply. "You are five days into
your Hogwarts education and already this has happened. Today is
Friday. Our <i>next</i> defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... No, we do <i>not</i> have
time to wait."</p>
<p>There were a few laughs at this, but very few.</p>
<p>"Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter.
What I would like to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any
offensive spells, because I would then hear that you had severely
hurt or even killed someone. Unfortunately I am told that your
fingers are already powerful weapons. Do not snap them at any time
during this lesson."</p>
<p>More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.</p>
<p>Harry felt like he might cry. "Professor Quirrell, if you do
anything like what you talked about, it's going to make me angry,
and I really would rather not get angry again today -"</p>
<p>"The point is <i>not</i> to avoid getting angry," Professor
Quirrell said, his face looking grave. "Anger is natural. You need
to learn how to lose even when you are angry. Or at least
<i>pretend</i> to lose so that you can <i>plan</i> your vengeance.
As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course any of you think he
really <i>is</i> better -"</p>
<p>"I'm not!" shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little
frantic. "I know you didn't really lose! Please don't plan any
vengeances!"</p>
<p>Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn't know
about his mysterious dark side. "Professor, we really need to talk
about this after class -"</p>
<p>"We will," Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise.
"After you learn how to lose." His face was serious. "It should go
without saying that I will exclude anything which could injure you
or even cause you significant pain. The pain will come from the
difficulty of losing, instead of fighting back and escalating the
battle until you win."</p>
<p>Harry's breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was more
frightened than he'd been after leaving the Potions classroom.
"Professor Quirrell," he managed to say, "I don't want you to get
fired over this -"</p>
<p>"I will not be," Professor Quirrell said, "if <i>you</i> tell
them afterward that it was necessary. And this I trust you to do."
For a moment Professor Quirrell's voice turned very dry. "Believe
me, they have tolerated worse in their hallways. This case will be
exceptional only in that it happens within a classroom."</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry whispered, but he thought his voice
was still being repeated everywhere, "do you really believe that if
I don't do this, I might hurt someone?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said simply.</p>
<p>"Then," Harry felt nauseous, "I'll do it."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. "So... with
the full approval of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape
cannot be blamed for your actions... do any of you wish to show
your dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around, push him
to the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?"</p>
<p>Five hands went up.</p>
<p>"Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What
part of <i>pretending</i> to lose did you not understand? If Harry
Potter does become the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down and
kill you after he graduates."</p>
<p>The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.</p>
<p>"I won't," Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. "I
swear never to take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose.
Professor Quirrell... would you <i>please</i>... <i>stop</i>
that?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sighed. "I <i>am</i> sorry, Mr. Potter. I
realize that you must find this equally annoying whether you intend
to become a Dark Lord or not. But those children <i>also</i> had an
important life lesson to learn. Would it be acceptable if I awarded
you a Quirrell point in apology?"</p>
<p>"Make it two," Harry said.</p>
<p>There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the
tension.</p>
<p>"Done," Professor Quirrell said.</p>
<p>"And after I graduate I'm going to hunt you down and
<i>tickle</i> you."</p>
<p>There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn't
smile.</p>
<p>Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force
the conversation through the narrow course that would make people
realize he wasn't a Dark Lord after all... <i>why</i> was Professor
Quirrell so suspicious of him?</p>
<p>"Professor," said Draco's unamplified voice. "It is also not my
own ambition to become a stupid Dark Lord."</p>
<p>There was a shocked silence in the classroom.</p>
<p><i>You don't have to do this!</i> Harry almost blurted out loud,
but checked himself in time; Draco might not wish it known that he
was doing this out of friendship for Harry... or out of the desire
to appear friendly...</p>
<p>Calling <i>that</i> a <i>desire to appear friendly</i> made
Harry feel small, and mean. If Draco had intended to impress him,
it was working perfectly.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. "<i>You</i>
worry that you cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw
which describes Mr. Potter also describes you? <i>Surely</i> your
father taught you better."</p>
<p>"When it comes to talking, maybe," said Draco, now on the
repeater screen. "Not when it comes to being shoved around and
pushed to the ground. I want to be fully as strong as you,
Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyebrows went up and stayed up. "I am
afraid, Mr. Malfoy," he said after a time, "that the arrangements I
made for Mr. Potter, involving some older Slytherins who will be
told <i>afterward</i> how stupid they were, would not carry over
onto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are already
very strong. Should I hear that you have failed, as Mr. Potter
failed today, I will make the appropriate arrangements and
apologize to you and whomever you have hurt. I do not think this
will be necessary, however."</p>
<p>"I understand, professor," said Draco.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked over the class. "Does anyone else wish
to become strong?"</p>
<p>Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought from
his back row, looked like they were opening their mouths but not
saying anything. In the end, no one spoke.</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year's
armies," said Professor Quirrell, "should he deign to engage in
that after-school activity. And now, Mr. Potter, please come
forward."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Yes,</i> Professor Quirrell had said, <i>it must be in front
of everyone, in front of your friends, because that is where Snape
confronted you and that is where you must learn to lose.</i></p>
<p>So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence,
and with requests from both Harry and the professor not to
intervene. Hermione had her face turned away, but she hadn't spoken
out or even given him any sort of significant look, maybe because
she'd been there in Potions too.</p>
<p>Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a
Muggle dojo, which Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor
for when Harry was pushed down.</p>
<p>Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell
was right about his intent to kill...</p>
<p>Harry's wand lay on Professor Quirrell's desk, not because Harry
knew any spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry
thought) he might have tried to jam it through someone's eye
socket. His pouch lay there, now containing his protected but still
potentially fragile Time-Turner.</p>
<p>Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him
some boxing gloves and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell
had given him a look of silent understanding, and refused.</p>
<p><i>I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes, I
will not go for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in
Hogwarts, I'll be arrested,</i> Harry chanted to himself, trying to
hammer the thought into his brain, hoping it would stay there if
his intent to kill took over.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins
of different years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he'd
hit with a pie. Two others from that confrontation were also
present. The one who'd said to stop, that they really shouldn't do
this, was missing.</p>
<p>"I repeat," Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern,
"Potter is <i>not</i> to be really hurt. Any and all
<i>accidents</i> will be treated as deliberate. Do you
understand?"</p>
<p>The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.</p>
<p>"Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few
pegs," Professor Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the
first-years understood.</p>
<p>By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front
of the group.</p>
<p>"Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick.
He is better than you and he is about to show you that."</p>
<p>Derrick strode forward and Harry's brain screamed discordantly,
he must not run away, he must not fight back -</p>
<p>Derrick stopped an arm's length away from Harry.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he
beheld a teenage boy fully half a meter taller than himself, with
clearly defined muscles, facial hair, and a grin of terrible
anticipation.</p>
<p>"Ask him not to hurt you," Professor Quirrell said. "Perhaps if
he sees that you're pathetic enough, he'll decide that you're
boring, and go away."</p>
<p>There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.</p>
<p>"Please," Harry said, his voice faltering, "don't, hurt,
me..."</p>
<p>"That didn't sound very sincere," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Derrick's smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very
superior and...</p>
<p>...Harry's blood temperature was dropping...</p>
<p>"Please don't hurt me," Harry tried again.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. "How in Merlin's name did you
manage to make that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one
response you can possibly expect from Mr. Derrick."</p>
<p>Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.</p>
<p>Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop
himself, straightened up icily.</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Professor Quirrell, "wrong, wrong, wrong."</p>
<p>"You bumped into me, Potter," Derrick said. "Apologize."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"You don't <i>sound</i> sorry," said Derrick.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened in indignation, he <i>had</i> managed to
make that sound pleading -</p>
<p>Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands
and knees.</p>
<p>The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry's vision, not far
away.</p>
<p>He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell's real motives in
teaching this so-called <i>lesson.</i></p>
<p>A foot rested on Harry's buttocks and a moment later Harry was
pushed hard to the side, sending him sprawling on his back.</p>
<p>Derrick laughed. "This is <i>fun,</i>" he said.</p>
<p>All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing
to the Headmaster's office. That would be the end of this
<i>Defense Professor</i> and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts and...
Professor McGonagall would be angry about that, but...</p>
<p>(An image of Professor McGonagall's face flashed before his
eyes, she didn't look angry, just sad -)</p>
<p>"Now tell him that he's better than you, Potter," said Professor
Quirrell's voice.</p>
<p>"You're, better, than, me."</p>
<p>Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his
chest and shoved him back down to the mat.</p>
<p>The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action
and their consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity.
The fool wouldn't be expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in
the groin would stun him long enough for -</p>
<p>"Try again," said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp
motion Harry rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where
stood his real enemy, the Defense Professor -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell said, "You have no patience."</p>
<p>Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a
picture of a wizened old man with blood pouring from his mouth
after Harry had ripped his tongue out -</p>
<p>A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then
sat down on him, sending Harry's breath whooshing out.</p>
<p>"Stop!" Harry screamed. "Please stop!"</p>
<p>"Better," said Professor Quirrell. "That even sounded
sincere."</p>
<p>It <i>had</i> been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening
thing, it <i>had</i> been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly, fear
and cold anger both flushing through him -</p>
<p>"Lose," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"I, lose," Harry forced out.</p>
<p>"I like it," Derrick said from on top of him. "Lose some
more."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of
older Slytherins to another set of hands that shoved him again.
Harry had long since passed the point of trying not to cry, and was
now just trying not to fall down.</p>
<p>"What are you, Potter?" said Derrick.</p>
<p>"A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you're b-better, than
me, please stop -"</p>
<p>Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands
not quite able to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then
began struggling to his feet again -</p>
<p>"<i>Enough!</i>" said Professor Quirrell's voice, sounding
sharp enough to cut iron. "Step away from Mr. Potter!"</p>
<p>Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his
blood, which had been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Then Harry collapsed to the mat.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older
Slytherins.</p>
<p>"And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to
explain to you as well," finished Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Draco's voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp
as professor Quirrell's, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had
used to imitate his father, and it was saying things like <i>could
have put Slytherin House in jeopardy</i> and <i>who knows how many
allies in this school alone</i> and <i>total lack of awareness,
never mind cunning</i> and <i>dull thugs, useful for nothing but
lackeys</i> and something in Harry's hindbrain, despite everything
he knew, was designating Draco as an ally.</p>
<p>Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold,
his mind utterly exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes's song, but
without the phoenix present he couldn't remember the melody and
when he tried to imagine it he couldn't seem to think of anything
except a bird chirping.</p>
<p>Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the older
Slytherins they were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and
struggled to sit up, "Wait," Harry said, forcing the words out,
"there's something, I want, to say, to them -"</p>
<p>"Wait on Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said coldly to the
departing Slytherins.</p>
<p>Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the
direction of his classmates. He didn't want to see how they were
looking at him now. He didn't want to see their pity.</p>
<p>So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still
seemed to be in a state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread
was on their faces.</p>
<p>His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the
imagination of this moment, and went on pretending to lose.</p>
<p>Harry said, "No one will -"</p>
<p>"Stop," said Professor Quirrell. "If that's what I think it is,
please wait until after they're gone. They'll hear about it later.
We all have our lessons to learn, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said.</p>
<p>"You. Go."</p>
<p>The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.</p>
<p>"No one's to take any revenge on them," Harry said hoarsely.
"That's a request to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I
had my lesson to learn, they helped me learn it, they had their
lesson to learn too, it's over. If you tell this story, make sure
you tell that part too."</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"You lost," said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the
first time. It sounded strange coming from the professor, like his
voice shouldn't even be able to do that.</p>
<p>Harry <i>had</i> lost. There had been moments when the cold
anger had faded entirely, replaced by fear, and during those
moments he'd begged the older Slytherins and he'd meant it...</p>
<p>"And are you yet alive?" said Professor Quirrell, still with
that strange gentleness.</p>
<p>Harry managed to nod.</p>
<p>"Not all losing is like this," said Professor Quirrell. "There
are compromises and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to
placate bullies. There is a whole art form to manipulating others
by letting them be dominant over you. But first, losing must be
<i>thinkable</i>. Will you remember how you lost?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Will you be able to lose?"</p>
<p>"I... think so..."</p>
<p>"I think so too." Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin
hair almost touched the floor. "Congratulations, Harry Potter, you
win."</p>
<p>There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started
all at once like a massive thunderclap.</p>
<p>Harry's couldn't keep the shock from his face. He risked a
glance at his classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity
but awe. The applause was coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and
Hufflepuff and even Slytherin, probably because Draco Malfoy was
applauding too. Some students were standing up from their chairs
and half of Gryffindor was standing on their desks.</p>
<p>So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over
him, feeling stronger, and maybe even a little healed.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took
quite a while.</p>
<p>"Surprised, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said. His voice
sounded amused. "You have just found out that the real world does
not <i>always</i> work like your worst nightmares. Yes, if you had
been some poor anonymous boy being abused, then they would probably
have respected you less afterward, pitied you even as they
comforted you from their loftier perches. That <i>is</i> human
nature, I'm afraid. But <i>you</i> they already know for a figure
of power. And they saw you confront your fear and keep confronting
it, even though you could have walked away at any time. Did you
think less of <i>me</i> when I told you that I had deliberately
endured being spat upon?"</p>
<p>Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically
clamped down. He didn't trust this miraculous respect enough to
start crying again in front of it.</p>
<p>"Your <i>extraordinary</i> achievement in my class deserves an
extraordinary reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my
compliments on behalf of my House, and remember from this day
forward that not all Slytherins are alike. There are Slytherins,
and then there are Slytherins." Professor Quirrell was smiling
quite broadly as he said this. "Fifty-one points to Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out among
the Ravenclaw students, howling and whistling and cheering.</p>
<p>(And in the same moment Harry felt something <i>wrong</i> about
that, Professor McGonagall had been right, there <i>should</i> have
been consequences, there should have been a cost and a price to be
paid, you couldn't just put everything back the way it was like
that -)</p>
<p>But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn't
possibly say no.</p>
<p>His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry
could not even believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let
alone producing good suggestions.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, as clearly as he could through
his burning throat. "You are everything a member of your House
should be, and I think you must be just what Salazar Slytherin had
in mind when he helped found Hogwarts. I thank you and your House,"
Draco was very slightly nodding and subtly turning his finger,
<i>keep going</i>, "and I think this calls for three cheers for
Slytherin. With me, everyone?" Harry paused. "<i>Huzzah!</i>" Only
a few people managed to join in on the first try. "<i>Huzzah!</i>"
This time most of Ravenclaw was in on it. "<i>Huzzah!</i>" That
was almost all of Ravenclaw, a scattering of Hufflepuffs and around
a quarter of Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Draco's hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.</p>
<p>Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few
were staring at Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was
looking at Harry with a calculating, intrigued expression.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell bowed. "Thank <i>you</i>, Harry Potter," he
said, still with that broad smile. He turned to the class. "Now,
believe it or not, we still have half an hour left in this session,
and that is enough to introduce the Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, of
course, is going off and taking a well-earned rest."</p>
<p>"I can -"</p>
<p>"Idiot," Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already
laughing. "Your classmates can teach you afterward, or I'll tutor
you privately if that's what it takes. But <i>right now</i>, you're
going through the third door from the left in the back of the
stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of exceptionally
tasty snacks, and some extremely light reading from the Hogwarts
library. You may not take anything else with you, particularly not
your textbooks. Now go."</p>
<p>Harry went.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="20">Chapter 20</h2><h3>Bayes's Theorem</h3>
<p>That which can be destroyed by the Rowling should be.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry stared up at the gray ceiling of the small room, from
where he lay on the portable yet soft bed that had been placed
there. He'd eaten quite a lot of Professor Quirrell's snacks -
intricate confections of chocolate and other substances, dusted
with sparkling sprinkles and jeweled with tiny sugar gems, looking
highly expensive and proving, in fact, to be quite tasty. Harry
hadn't felt the least bit guilty about it either, <i>this</i> he
had <i>earned</i>.</p>
<p>He hadn't tried to sleep. Harry had a feeling that he wouldn't
like what happened when he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He hadn't tried to read. He wouldn't have been able to
focus.</p>
<p>Funny how Harry's brain just seemed to keep on running and
running, never shutting down no matter how tired it got. It got
stupider but it refused to <i>switch off.</i></p>
<p>But there was, there really and truly was a feeling of
triumph.</p>
<p>Anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program, +1 point didn't <i>begin</i> to
cover it. Harry wondered what the Sorting Hat would say <i>now</i>,
if he could put it on his head.</p>
<p>No <i>wonder</i> Professor Quirrell had accused Harry of heading
down the path of a Dark Lord. Harry had been too slow on the
uptake, he should have seen the parallel right away -</p>
<p><i>Understand that the Dark Lord did not win that day. His goal
was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a single
lesson.</i></p>
<p>Harry had entered the Potions class with the intent to learn
Potions. He'd left without a single lesson.</p>
<p>And Professor Quirrell had heard, and understood with
frightening precision, and reached out and yanked Harry off that
path, the path that led to his becoming a copy of You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. "Classes are over," said
Professor Quirrell's quiet voice.</p>
<p>Harry approached the door and found himself suddenly nervous.
Then the tension diminished as he heard Professor Quirrell's
footsteps moving away from the door.</p>
<p><i>What on Earth is that about? Is it what's going to get him
fired eventually?</i></p>
<p>Harry opened the door, and saw that Professor Quirrell was now
waiting several bodylengths away.</p>
<p><i>Does Professor Quirrell feel it too?</i></p>
<p>They walked across the now-deserted stage to Professor
Quirrell's desk, which Professor Quirrell leaned on; and Harry, as
before, stopped short of the dais.</p>
<p>"So," Professor Quirrell said. There was a friendly sense about
him somehow, even though his face still kept its usual seriousness.
"What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p><i>I have a mysterious dark side.</i> But Harry couldn't just
blurt it out like that.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "am I off the path to becoming
a Dark Lord, now?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. "Mr. Potter," he said
solemnly, with only a slight grin, "a word of advice. There is such
a thing as a performance which is too perfect. Real people who have
just been beaten and humiliated for fifteen minutes do not stand up
and graciously forgive their enemies. It is the sort of thing you
do when you're trying to <i>convince</i> everyone you're not Dark,
not -"</p>
<p>"<i>I can't believe this! You can't have every possible
observation confirm your theory!</i>"</p>
<p>"And that was a <i>trifle</i> too much indignation."</p>
<p>"<i>What on Earth do I have to do to convince you?</i>"</p>
<p>"To convince me that you harbor no ambitions of becoming a Dark
Lord?" said Professor Quirrell, now looking outright amused. "I
suppose you could just raise your right hand."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said blankly. "But I can raise my right hand
whether or not I -" Harry stopped, feeling rather stupid.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "You can just as easily do it
either way. There is nothing you can do to convince me because I
would know that was exactly what you were trying to do. And if we
are to be even more precise, then while I suppose it is barely
possible that perfectly good people exist even though I have never
met one, it is nonetheless <i>improbable</i> that someone would be
beaten for fifteen minutes and then stand up and feel a great surge
of kindly forgiveness for his attackers. On the other hand it is
<i>less</i> improbable that a young child would imagine this as the
<i>role to play</i> in order to convince his teacher and classmates
that he is not the next Dark Lord. The import of an act lies not in
what that act <i>resembles on the surface,</i> Mr. Potter, but in
the states of mind which make that act more or less probable."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. He'd just had the dichotomy between the
representativeness heuristic and the Bayesian definition of
evidence explained to him by a wizard.</p>
<p>"But then again," said Professor Quirrell, "anyone can want to
impress their friends. That need not be Dark. So without it being
any kind of admission, Mr. Potter, tell me honestly. What thought
was in your mind at the moment when you forbade any vengeance? Was
that thought a true impulse to forgiveness? Or was it an awareness
of how your classmates would see the act?"</p>
<p><i>Sometimes we make our own phoenix song.</i></p>
<p>But Harry didn't say it out loud. It was clear that Professor
Quirrell wouldn't believe him, and would probably respect him less
for trying to utter such a transparent lie.</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, Professor Quirrell smiled with
satisfaction. "Believe it or not, Mr. Potter," said the professor,
"you need not fear me for having discovered your secret. I am
<i>not</i> going to tell you to give up on becoming the next Dark
Lord. If I could turn back the hands of time and somehow remove
that ambition from the mind of my child self, the self of this
present time would not benefit from the alteration. For as long as
I thought that was my goal, it drove me to study and learn and
refine myself and become stronger. We become what we are meant to
be by following our desires wherever they lead. That is the insight
of Salazar. Ask me to show you to the library section which holds
those same books I read as a thirteen-year-old, and I will happily
lead the way."</p>
<p>"For the love of crap," Harry said, and sat down on the hard
marble floor, and then lay back on the floor, staring up at the
distant arches of the ceiling. It was as close as he could come to
collapsing in despair without hurting himself.</p>
<p>"Still too much indignation," observed Professor Quirrell. Harry
wasn't looking but he could hear the suppressed laughter in the
voice.</p>
<p>Then Harry realized.</p>
<p>"Actually, I think I know what's confusing you here," Harry
said. "That was what I wanted to talk to you about, in fact.
Professor Quirrell, I think that what you're seeing is my
mysterious dark side."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Your... dark side..."</p>
<p>Harry sat up. Professor Quirrell was regarding him with one of
the strangest expressions Harry had seen on anyone's face, let
alone anyone as dignified as Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"It happens when I get angry," Harry explained. "My blood runs
cold, everything gets cold, everything seems perfectly clear... In
retrospect it's been with me for a while - in my first year of
Muggle school, someone tried to take away my ball during recess and
I held it behind my back and kicked him in the solar plexus which
I'd read was a weak point, and the other kids didn't bother me
after that. And I bit a math teacher when she wouldn't accept my
dominance. But it's only just recently that I've been under enough
stress to notice that it's an actual, you know, mysterious dark
side, and not just an anger management problem like the school
psychologist said. And I don't have any super magical powers when
it happens, that was one of the first things I checked."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell rubbed his nose. "Let me think about this,"
he said.</p>
<p>Harry waited in silence for a full minute. He used that time to
stand up, which was more difficult than he had expected.</p>
<p>"Well," Professor Quirrell said after a while. "I suppose there
<i>was</i> something you could say that would convince me."</p>
<p>"I <i>have</i> already guessed that my dark side is really just
another part of me and that the answer isn't to never become angry
but to learn to stay in control by accepting it, I'm not dumb or
anything and I've seen this story enough times to know where it's
going, but it's hard and you seem like the person to help me."</p>
<p>"Well... yes... very perspicacious of you, Mr. Potter, I must
say... that side of you is, as you seem to have already surmised,
your intent to kill, which as you say is a part of you..."</p>
<p>"And needs to be trained," Harry said, completing the
pattern.</p>
<p>"And needs to be trained, yes." That strange expression was
still on Professor Quirrell's face. "Mr. Potter, if you truly do
not wish to be the next Dark Lord, then what was the ambition which
the Sorting Hat tried to convince you to abandon, the ambition for
which you were Sorted into Slytherin?"</p>
<p>"I was Sorted into <i>Ravenclaw!</i>"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, now with a much more
usual-looking dry smile, "I know you are accustomed to everyone
around you being a fool, but please do not mistake me for one of
them. The likelihood that the Sorting Hat would play its first
prank in eight hundred years while it was upon your head is so
small as to not be worth considering. I suppose it is barely
possible that you snapped your fingers and invented some simple and
clever way to defeat the anti-tampering spells upon the Hat, though
I myself can think of no such method. But by far the most probable
explanation is that Dumbledore decided he was not happy with the
Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived. This is evident to anyone with
the tiniest smidgin of common sense, so your secret is safe at
Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again with a feeling of
complete helplessness. Professor Quirrell was wrong, but wrong in
such a convincing way that Harry was starting to think that it
simply <i>was</i> the rational judgment given the evidence
available to Professor Quirrell. There were times, never
<i>predictable</i> times but still sometimes, when you would get
improbable evidence and the best knowable guess would be wrong. If
you had a medical test that was only wrong one time in a thousand,
sometimes it would still be wrong anyway.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you never to repeat what I'm about to say?" said
Harry.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," said Professor Quirrell. "Consider me asked."</p>
<p>Harry wasn't a fool either. "Can I consider you to have said
yes?"</p>
<p>"Very good, Mr. Potter. You may indeed so consider."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Quirrell -</i>"</p>
<p>"I won't repeat what you're about to say," Professor Quirrell
said, smiling.</p>
<p>They both laughed, then Harry turned serious again. "The Sorting
Hat did seem to think I was going to end up as a Dark Lord unless I
went to Hufflepuff," Harry said. "But I don't <i>want</i> to be
one."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter..." said Professor Quirrell. "Don't take this the
wrong way. I promise you will not be graded on the answer. I only
want to know your own, honest reply. Why not?"</p>
<p>Harry had that <i>helpless</i> feeling again. <i>Thou shalt not
become a Dark Lord</i> was such an obvious theorem in his moral
system that it was hard to describe the actual proof steps. "Um,
people would get hurt?"</p>
<p>"Surely you've wanted to hurt people," said Professor Quirrell.
"You wanted to hurt those bullies today. Being a Dark Lord means
that people you <i>want</i> to hurt get hurt."</p>
<p>Harry floundered for words and then decided to simply go with
the obvious. "First of all, just because I want to hurt someone
doesn't mean it's right -"</p>
<p>"What makes something right, if not your wanting it?"</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said, "preference utilitarianism."</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"It's the ethical theory that the good is what satisfies the
preferences of the most people -"</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said. His fingers rubbed the bridge of
his nose. "I don't think that's quite what I was trying to say. Mr.
Potter, in the end people all do what they want to do. Sometimes
people give names like 'right' to things they want to do, but how
could we possibly act on anything <i>but</i> our own desires?"</p>
<p>"Well, obviously," Harry said. "I couldn't <i>act</i> on moral
considerations if they lacked the power to move me. But that
doesn't mean my wanting to hurt those Slytherins has the power to
move me <i>more</i> than moral considerations!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell blinked.</p>
<p>"Not to mention," Harry said, "being a Dark Lord would mean that
a lot of innocent bystanders got hurt too!"</p>
<p>"Why does that matter to you?" Professor Quirrell said. "What
have they done for you?"</p>
<p>Harry laughed. "Oh, now <i>that</i> was around as subtle as
<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i>"</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" Professor Quirrell said again.</p>
<p>"It's a book that my parents wouldn't let me read because they
thought it would corrupt me, so of course I read it anyway and I
was offended they thought I would fall for any traps that obvious.
Blah blah blah, appeal to my sense of superiority, other people are
trying to keep me down, blah blah blah."</p>
<p>"So you're saying I need to make my traps less obvious?" said
Professor Quirrell. He tapped a finger on his cheek, looking
thoughtful. "I can work on that."</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>"But to stay with the current question," said Professor
Quirrell, "what <i>have</i> all these other people done for
you?"</p>
<p>"Other people have done <i>huge</i> amounts for me!" Harry said.
"My parents took me in when my parents died because they were
<i>good people,</i> and to become a Dark Lord is to betray
that!"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was silent for a time.</p>
<p>"I confess," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "when I was your
age, that thought could not ever have come to me."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Don't be," said Professor Quirrell. "It was long ago, and I
resolved my parental issues to my own satisfaction. So you are held
back by the thought of your parents' disapproval? Does that mean
that if they died in an accident, there would be nothing left to
stop you from -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. "Just no. It is their <i>impulse to
kindness</i> which sheltered me. That impulse is not only in my
parents. And that impulse is what would be betrayed."</p>
<p>"In any case, Mr. Potter, you have not answered my original
question," said Professor Quirrell finally. "What <i>is</i> your
ambition?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Harry. "Um.." He organized his thoughts. "To
understand everything important there is to know about the
universe, apply that knowledge to become omnipotent, and use that
power to rewrite reality because I have some objections to the way
it works now."</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"Forgive me if this is a stupid question, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, "but are you <i>sure</i> you did not just
confess to wanting to be a Dark Lord?"</p>
<p>"That's only if you use your power for evil," explained Harry.
"If you use the power for good, you're a Light Lord."</p>
<p>"I see," Professor Quirrell said. He tapped his other cheek with
a finger. "I suppose I can work with that. But Mr. Potter, while
the scope of your ambition is worthy of Salazar himself, how
exactly do you propose to go about it? Is step one to become a
great fighting wizard, or Head Unspeakable, or Minister of Magic,
or -"</p>
<p>"Step one is to become a scientist."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry as if he'd just turned
into a cat.</p>
<p>"A scientist," Professor Quirrell said after a while.</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"A <i>scientist?</i>" repeated Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "I shall achieve my objectives through the
power... of <i>Science!</i>"</p>
<p>"A <i>scientist!</i>" said Professor Quirrell. There was
genuine indignation on his face, and his voice had grown stronger
and sharper. "You could be the best of all my students! The
greatest fighting wizard to come out of Hogwarts in five decades! I
cannot picture you wasting your days in a white lab coat doing
pointless things to rats!"</p>
<p>"Hey!" said Harry. "There's more to science than that! Not that
there's anything <i>wrong</i> with experimenting on rats, of
course. But science <i>is</i> how you go about understanding and
controlling the universe -"</p>
<p>"Fool," said Professor Quirrell, in a voice of quiet, bitter
intensity. "You're a fool, Harry Potter." He passed a hand over his
face, and when that hand had passed, his face was calmer. "Or more
likely you have not yet found your true ambition. May I strongly
recommend that you try to become a Dark Lord instead? I will do
anything I can to help as a matter of public service."</p>
<p>"You don't like science," Harry said slowly. "Why not?"</p>
<p>"Those fool Muggles will kill us all someday!" Professor
Quirrell's voice had grown louder. "They will end it! End all of
it!"</p>
<p>Harry was feeling a bit lost here. "What are we talking about
here, nuclear weapons?"</p>
<p>"<i>Yes</i>, nuclear weapons!" Professor Quirrell was almost
shouting now. "Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never used those,
perhaps because he didn't want to rule over a heap of ash! They
never should have been made! And it will only get worse with time!"
Professor Quirrell was standing up straight instead of leaning on
his desk. "There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do
not breach! The fools who can't resist meddling are killed by the
lesser perils early on, and the survivors all know that there are
secrets you <i>do not share</i> with anyone who lacks the
intelligence and the discipline to discover them for themselves!
Every powerful wizard knows that! Even the most terrible Dark
Wizards know that! And those idiot Muggles can't seem to figure it
out! The eager little fools who discovered the secret of nuclear
weapons didn't keep it to themselves, they told their <i>fool</i>
politicians and now <i>we</i> must live under the constant threat
of annihilation!"</p>
<p>This was a rather different way of looking at things than Harry
had grown up with. It had never occurred to him that nuclear
physicists should have formed a conspiracy of silence to keep the
secret of nuclear weapons from anyone not smart enough to be a
nuclear physicist. The thought was intriguing, if nothing else.
Would they have had secret passwords? Would they have had
masks?</p>
<p>(Actually, for all Harry knew, there <i>were</i> all sorts of
incredibly destructive secrets which physicists kept to themselves,
and the secret of nuclear weapons was the only one that had escaped
into the wild. The world would look the same to him either
way.)</p>
<p>"I'll have to think about that," Harry said to Professor
Quirrell. "It's a new idea to me. And one of the <i>hidden</i>
secrets of science, passed down from a few rare teachers to their
grad students, is how to avoid flushing new ideas down the toilet
the instant you hear one you don't like."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell blinked again.</p>
<p>"Is there any sort of science you <i>do</i> approve of?" said
Harry. "Medicine, maybe?"</p>
<p>"Space travel," said Professor Quirrell. "But the Muggles seem
to be dragging their feet on the one project which might have let
wizardkind escape this planet before they blow it up."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "I'm a big fan of the space program too. At least
we have that much in common."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. Something flickered in the
professor's eyes. "I will have your word, your promise and your
oath never to speak of what follows."</p>
<p>"You have it," Harry said immediately.</p>
<p>"See to it that you keep your oath or you will not like the
results," said Professor Quirrell. "I will now cast a rare and
powerful spell, not on you, but on the classroom around us. Stand
still, so that you do not touch the boundaries of the spell once it
has been cast. You must not interact with the magic which I am
maintaining. Look only. Otherwise I will end the spell." Professor
Quirrell paused. "And try not to fall over."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, puzzled and anticipatory.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell raised his wand and said something that
Harry's ears and mind couldn't grasp at all, words that bypassed
awareness and vanished into oblivion.</p>
<p>The marble in a short radius around Harry's feet stayed
constant. All the other marble of the floor vanished, the walls and
ceilings vanished.</p>
<p>Harry stood on a small circle of white marble in the midst of an
endless field of stars, burning terribly bright and unwavering.
There was no Earth, no Moon, no Sun that Harry recognized.
Professor Quirrell stood in the same place as before, floating in
the midst of the starfield. The Milky Way was already visible as a
great wash of light and it grew brighter as Harry's vision adjusted
to the darkness.</p>
<p>The sight wrenched at Harry's heart like nothing he had ever
seen.</p>
<p>"Are we... in space...?"</p>
<p>"No," said Professor Quirrell. His voice was sad, and reverent.
"But it is a true image."</p>
<p>Tears came into Harry's eyes. He wiped them away frantically, he
would not miss this for some stupid water blurring his vision.</p>
<p>The stars were no longer tiny jewels set in a giant velvet dome,
as they were in the night sky of Earth. Here there was no sky
above, no surrounding sphere. Only points of perfect light against
perfect blackness, an infinite and empty void with countless tiny
holes through which shone the brilliance from some unimaginable
realm beyond.</p>
<p>In space, the stars <i>looked</i> terribly, terribly, terribly
far away.</p>
<p>Harry kept on wiping his eyes, over and over.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it
almost wasn't there, "when this flawed world seems unusually
hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far
away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that
place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I
believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and
perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far
away. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew
the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a
long, long time..."</p>
<p>Though it felt like sacrilege, Harry managed a whisper. "Please
let me stay here awhile."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded, where he stood unsupported against
the stars.</p>
<p>It was easy to forget the small circle of marble on which you
stood, and your own body, and become a point of awareness which
might have been still, or might have been moving. With all
distances incalculable there was no way to tell.</p>
<p>There was a time of no time.</p>
<p>And then the stars vanished, and the classroom returned.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Professor Quirrell, "but we're about to have
company."</p>
<p>"It's fine," Harry whispered. "It was enough." He would never
forget this day, and not because of the unimportant things that had
happened earlier. He would learn how to cast that spell if it was
the last thing he ever learned.</p>
<p>Then the heavy oaken doors of the classroom blasted off their
hinges and skittered across the marble floor with a high-pitched
shriek.</p>
<p>"<i>QUIRINUS! HOW DARE YOU!</i>"</p>
<p>Like a vast thundercloud, an ancient and powerful wizard blew
into the room, a look of such incandescent rage upon his face that
the stern look he had earlier turned upon Harry seemed like
nothing.</p>
<p>There was a wrench of disorientation in Harry's mind as the part
that wanted to run away screaming from the scariest thing it had
ever seen ran away, rotating into place a part of him which could
take the shock.</p>
<p><i>None</i> of Harry's facets were happy about having their
star-gazing interrupted. "Headmaster Albus Percival -" Harry
started to say in icy tones.</p>
<p><i>WHAM.</i> Professor Quirrell's hand came down hard upon his
desk. "<i>Mr. Potter!</i>" barked Professor Quirrell. "This is the
<i>Headmaster of Hogwarts</i> and you are a mere student! You will
address him appropriately!"</p>
<p>Harry looked at Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was giving Harry a stern glare.</p>
<p>Neither of them smiled.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's long strides had come to a halt before where Harry
stood in front of the dais and Professor Quirrell stood by his
desk. The Headmaster stared in shock at both of them.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said in meekly polite tones. "Headmaster,
thank you for wanting to protect me, but Professor Quirrell did the
right thing."</p>
<p>Slowly, Dumbledore's expression changed from something that
would vaporize steel into something merely angry. "I heard students
saying that this man had you abused by older Slytherins! That he
forbade you to defend yourself!"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "He knew exactly what was wrong with me and he
showed me how to fix it."</p>
<p>"Harry, <i>what are you talking about?</i>"</p>
<p>"I was teaching him how to lose," Professor Quirrell said dryly.
"It's an important life skill."</p>
<p>It was apparent that Dumbledore still didn't understand, but his
voice had lowered in register. "Harry..." he said slowly. "If
there's any threat the Defense Professor has offered you to prevent
you from complaining -"</p>
<p><i>You lunatic, after today of all days do you really think I
-</i></p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, trying to look abashed, "what's wrong
with me isn't that I keep quiet about abusive professors."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell chuckled. "Not perfect, Mr. Potter, but good
enough for your first day. Headmaster, did you stay long enough to
hear about the fifty-one points for Ravenclaw, or did you storm out
as soon as you heard the first part?"</p>
<p>A brief look of disconcertment crossed Dumbledore's face,
followed by surprise. "Fifty-one points for Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "He wasn't expecting them, but it
seemed appropriate. Tell Professor McGonagall that I think the
story of what Mr. Potter went through to earn back the lost points
will do just as well to make her point. No, Headmaster, Mr. Potter
didn't tell me anything. It's easy to see which part of today's
events are her work, just as I know that the final compromise was
your own suggestion. Though I wonder how on Earth Mr. Potter was
able to gain the upper hand over both Snape and you and then
Professor McGonagall was able to gain the upper hand over him."</p>
<p>Somehow Harry managed to control his face. Was it <i>that</i>
obvious to a real Slytherin?</p>
<p>Dumbledore came closer to Harry, scrutinizing. "Your color looks
a little off, Harry," the old wizard said. He peered closely at
Harry's face. "What did you have for lunch today?"</p>
<p>"What?" Harry said, his mind wobbling in sudden confusion. Why
would Dumbledore be asking about deep-fried lamb and thin-sliced
broccoli when that was just about the <i>last</i> probable cause of
-</p>
<p>The old wizard straightened up. "Never mind, then. I think
you're fine."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell coughed, loudly and deliberately. Harry
looked at the professor, and saw that Professor Quirrell was
staring sharply at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah-hem!</i>" Professor Quirrell said again.</p>
<p>Dumbledore and Professor Quirrell locked eyes, and something
seemed to pass between them.</p>
<p>"If you don't tell him," Professor Quirrell said then, "I will,
even if you fire me for it."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed and turned back to Harry. "I apologize for
invading your mental privacy, Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said
formally. "I had no purpose except to determine if Professor
Quirrell had done the same."</p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p>The confusion lasted just exactly as long as it took Harry to
understand what had just happened.</p>
<p>"<i>You - !</i>"</p>
<p>"Gently, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His face was
hard, however, as he stared at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Legilimency is sometimes mistaken for common sense," said the
Headmaster. "But it leaves traces which another skillful Legilimens
can detect. That was all I looked for, Mr. Potter, and I asked you
an irrelevant question to ensure you wouldn't think about anything
important while I looked."</p>
<p>"<i>You should have asked first!</i>"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head. "No, Mr. Potter, the
Headmaster had some justification for his concerns, and had he
asked for permission you would have thought of exactly those things
you did not wish him to see." Professor Quirrell's voice grew
sharper. "I am rather more concerned, Headmaster, that you saw no
need to tell him afterward!"</p>
<p>"You have now made it more difficult to confirm his mental
privacy on future occasions," Dumbledore said. He favored Professor
Quirrell with a cold look. "Was that your intention, I wonder?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was implacable. "There are too
many Legilimens in this school. I insist that Mr. Potter receive
instruction in Occlumency. Will you permit me to be his tutor?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely not," Dumbledore said at once.</p>
<p>"I did not think so. Then since <i>you</i> have deprived him of
my free services, <i>you</i> will pay for Mr. Potter's tutoring by
a licensed Occlumency instructor."</p>
<p>"Such services do not come cheaply," Dumbledore said, looking at
Professor Quirrell in some surprise. "Although I do have certain
connections -"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shook his head firmly. "No. Mr. Potter will
ask his account manager at Gringotts to recommend a neutral
instructor. With respect, Headmaster Dumbledore, after the events
of this morning I must protest you or your friends having access to
Mr. Potter's mind. I must also insist that the instructor have
taken an Unbreakable Vow to reveal nothing, and that he agree to be
Obliviated of each session immediately afterward."</p>
<p>Dumbledore was frowning. "Such services are <i>extremely</i>
expensive, as you well know, and I cannot help but wonder why
<i>you</i> deem them necessary."</p>
<p>"If it's money that's the problem," Harry spoke up, "I have some
ideas for making large amounts of money quickly -"</p>
<p>"Thank you Quirinus, your wisdom is now quite evident and I am
sorry for disputing it. Your concern for Harry Potter does you
credit, as well."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," said Professor Quirrell. "I hope you will not
object if I go on making him a particular focus of my attentions."
Professor Quirrell's face was now very serious, and very still.</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at Harry.</p>
<p>"It is my own wish also," Harry said.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is to be..." the old wizard said slowly.
Something strange passed across his face. "Harry... you must
realize that if you choose this man as your teacher and your
friend, your first mentor, then one way or another you will lose
him, and the manner in which you lose him may or may not allow you
to ever get him back."</p>
<p>That hadn't occurred to Harry. But there <i>was</i> that jinx on
the Defense position... one which had apparently worked with
perfect regularity for decades...</p>
<p>"Probably," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "but he will have
the full use of me while I last."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. "I suppose it is economical, at least, since
as the Defense Professor you're <i>already</i> doomed in some
unknown fashion."</p>
<p>Harry had to work hard to suppress his expression as he realized
what Dumbledore had actually been implying.</p>
<p>"I will inform Madam Pince that Mr. Potter is allowed to obtain
books on Occlumency," said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"There is preliminary training which you must do on your own,"
said Professor Quirrell to Harry. "And I do suggest that you hurry
up on it."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"I'll take my leave of you then," said Dumbledore. He nodded to
both Harry and Professor Quirrell, and departed, walking a bit
slowly.</p>
<p>"Can you cast the spell again?" Harry said the moment Dumbledore
was gone.</p>
<p>"Not today," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "and not tomorrow
either, I'm afraid. It takes a lot out of me to cast, though less
to keep going, and so I usually prefer to maintain it as long as
possible. This time I cast it on impulse. Had I thought, and
realized we might be interrupted -"</p>
<p>Dumbledore was now Harry's least favorite person in the entire
world.</p>
<p>They both sighed.</p>
<p>"Even if I only ever see it once," Harry said, "I will never
stop being grateful to you."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded.</p>
<p>"Have you heard of the Pioneer program?" Harry said. "They were
probes that would fly by different planets and take pictures. Two
of the probes would end up on trajectories that took them out of
the Solar System and into interstellar space. So they put a golden
plaque on the probes, with a picture of a man, and a woman, and
showing where to find our Sun in the galaxy."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was silent for a moment, then smiled. "Tell
me, Mr. Potter, can you guess what thought went through my mind
when I finished assembling the thirty-seven items on the list of
things I would never do as a Dark Lord? Put yourself in my shoes -
imagine yourself in my place - and guess."</p>
<p>Harry imagined himself looking over a list of thirty-seven
things not to do once he became a Dark Lord.</p>
<p>"You decided that if you had to follow the <i>whole</i> list
<i>all</i> the time, there wouldn't be much point in becoming a
Dark Lord in the first place," Harry said.</p>
<p>"<i>Precisely</i>," said Professor Quirrell. He was grinning.
"So I am going to violate rule two - which was simply 'don't brag'
- and tell you about something I have done. I don't see how the
knowledge could do any harm. And I strongly suspect you would have
figured it out anyway, once we knew each other well enough.
Nonetheless... I shall have your oath never to speak of what I am
about to tell."</p>
<p>"You have it!" Harry had a feeling this was going to be
<i>really</i> good.</p>
<p>"I subscribe to a Muggle bulletin which keeps me informed of
progress on space travel. I didn't hear about Pioneer 10 until they
reported its launch. But when I discovered that Pioneer 11 would
also be leaving the Solar System forever," Professor Quirrell said,
his grin the widest that Harry had yet seen from him, "I snuck into
NASA, I did, and I cast a lovely little spell on that lovely golden
plaque which will make it last a lot longer than it otherwise
would."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said, who now seemed to be standing
around fifty feet taller, "I thought that was how you might
react."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"...I can't think of anything to say."</p>
<p>"'You win' seems appropriate," said Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"You win," Harry said immediately.</p>
<p>"See?" said Professor Quirrell. "We can only imagine what giant
heap of trouble you would have gotten into if you had been unable
to say that."</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>A further thought occurred to Harry. "You didn't add any extra
information to the plaque, did you?"</p>
<p>"Extra information?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding as if the
idea had never occurred to him before and he was quite
intrigued.</p>
<p>Which made Harry rather suspicious, considering that it'd taken
less than a minute for <i>Harry</i> to think of it.</p>
<p>"Maybe you included a holographic message like in <i>Star
Wars?</i>" said Harry. "Or... hm. A portrait seems to store a
whole human brain's worth of information... you couldn't have added
any extra mass to the probe, but maybe you could've turned an
existing part into a portrait of yourself? Or you found a volunteer
dying of a terminal illness, snuck them into NASA, and cast a spell
to make sure their <i>ghost</i> ended up in the plaque -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said, his voice suddenly sharp,
"a spell requiring a human death would certainly be classified by
the Ministry as Dark Arts, regardless of circumstances. Students
should not be heard talking about such things."</p>
<p>And the amazing thing about the way Professor Quirrell said it
was how perfectly it maintained plausible deniability. It had been
said in exactly the appropriate tone for someone who wasn't willing
to discuss such things and thought students should steer away from
them. Harry honestly <i>didn't know</i> whether Professor Quirrell
was just waiting to talk about it until after Harry had learned to
protect his mind.</p>
<p>"Got it," Harry said. "I won't talk with anyone else about that
idea."</p>
<p>"Please be discreet about the whole matter, Mr. Potter,"
Professor Quirrell said. "I prefer to go through my life without
attracting public notice. You will find nothing in the newspapers
about Quirinus Quirrell until I decided it was time for me to teach
Defense at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>That seemed a little sad, but Harry understood. Then Harry
realized the implications. "So just how much awesome stuff
<i>have</i> you done that no one else knows about -"</p>
<p>"Oh, some," said Professor Quirrell. "But I think that's quite
enough for today, Mr. Potter, I confess I am feeling a bit tired
-"</p>
<p>"I understand. And <i>thank you.</i> For <i>everything</i>."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded, but he was leaning harder on his
desk.</p>
<p>Harry quickly took his leave.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="21">Chapter 21</h2><h3>Rationalization</h3>
<p>Rowling is whoever does Rowling's job.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Hermione Granger had worried she was turning Bad.</p>
<p>The difference between Good and Bad was usually easy to grasp,
she'd never understood why other people had so much trouble. At
Hogwarts, "Good" was Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall
and Professor Sprout. "Bad" was Professor Snape and Professor
Quirrell and Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter... was one of those unusual
cases where you <i>couldn't</i> tell just by looking. She was still
trying to figure out where he belonged.</p>
<p>But when it came to <i>herself</i>...</p>
<p>Hermione was having <i>too much fun</i> crushing Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>She'd done better than him in every single class they'd taken.
(Except for broomstick riding which was like gym class, it didn't
count.) She'd gotten <i>real</i> House points almost every day of
their first week, not for weird heroic things, but <i>smart</i>
things like learning spells quickly and helping other students. She
knew those kinds of House points were better, and the best part
was, Harry Potter knew it too. She could see it in his eyes every
time she won another <i>real</i> House point.</p>
<p>If you were Good, you weren't supposed to enjoy winning this
much.</p>
<p>It had started on the day of the train ride, though it had taken
a while for the whirlwind to sink in. It wasn't until later that
night that Hermione had begun to realize just <i>how much</i> she'd
let that boy walk all over her.</p>
<p>Before she'd met Harry Potter she hadn't had anyone she'd wanted
to crush. If someone wasn't doing as well as her in class, it was
her job to help them, not rub it in. That was what it meant to be
Good.</p>
<p>And now...</p>
<p>...now she was <i>winning</i>, Harry Potter was flinching every
time she got another House point, and it was <i>so much</i> fun,
her parents had warned her against drugs and she suspected this was
<i>more fun</i> than that.</p>
<p>She'd always liked the smiles that teachers gave her when she
did something right. She'd always liked seeing the long row of
check-marks on a perfectly answered test. But now when she did well
in class she would casually glance around and catch a glimpse of
Harry Potter gritting his teeth, and it made her want to burst into
song like a Disney movie.</p>
<p>That was Bad, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Hermione had worried she was turning Bad.</p>
<p>And then a thought had come to her which wiped away all her
fears.</p>
<p>She and Harry were getting into a Romance! Of course! Everyone
knew what it meant when a boy and a girl started fighting all the
time. They were <i>courting</i> one another! There was nothing Bad
about <i>that.</i></p>
<p>It couldn't be that she just <i>enjoyed</i> beating the living
scholastic daylights out of the most famous student in the school,
someone who was <i>in</i> books and <i>talked</i> like books, the
boy who had somehow vanquished the Dark Lord and even smushed
<i>Professor Snape</i> like a sad little bug, the boy who was, as
Professor Quirrell would have put it, dominant, over everyone else
in first-year Ravenclaw <i>except</i> for Hermione Granger who was
utterly <i>squishing</i> the Boy-Who-Lived in all his classes
besides broomstick riding.</p>
<p>Because that would have been Bad.</p>
<p>No. It was Romance. <i>That</i> was it. <i>That</i> was why they
were fighting.</p>
<p>Hermione was glad she had figured this out in time for today,
when Harry would lose their book-reading contest, which the
<i>whole school</i> knew about, and she wanted to start
<i>dancing</i> with the sheer overflowing joy of it.</p>
<p>It was 2:45pm on Saturday and Harry Potter had half of Bathilda
Bagshot's <i>A History of Magic</i> left to read and she was
staring at her pocket watch as it ticked with dreadful slowness
toward 2:47pm.</p>
<p>And the entire Ravenclaw common room was watching.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the first-years, news had spread like spilled
milk and fully half of Ravenclaw was crowded into the room,
squeezed into sofas and leaning on bookcases and sitting on the
arms of chairs. All six prefects were there including the Head Girl
of Hogwarts. Someone had needed to cast an Air-Freshening Charm
just so that there would be enough oxygen. And the din of
conversation had died into whispers which had now faded into utter
silence.</p>
<p>2:46pm.</p>
<p>The tension was unbearable. If it had been anyone else,
<i>anyone</i> else, his defeat would have been a foregone
conclusion.</p>
<p>But this was Harry Potter, and you couldn't rule out the
possibility that he would, sometime in the next few seconds, raise
a hand and snap his fingers.</p>
<p>With sudden terror she realized how Harry Potter might be able
to do exactly that. It would be <i>just like him</i> to have
<i>already finished reading</i> the second half of the book
earlier...</p>
<p>Hermione's vision began to swim. She tried to make herself
breathe, and found that she simply couldn't.</p>
<p>Ten seconds left, and he still hadn't raised his hand.</p>
<p>Five seconds left.</p>
<p>2:47pm.</p>
<p>Harry Potter carefully placed a bookmark into his book, closed
it, and laid it aside.</p>
<p>"I would like to note for the benefit of posterity," said the
Boy-Who-Lived in a clear voice, "that I had only half a book left,
and that I ran into a number of unexpected delays -"</p>
<p>"<i>You lost!</i>" shrieked Hermione. "You <i>did!</i> You
<i>lost our contest!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a collective exhalation as everyone started breathing
again.</p>
<p>Harry Potter shot her a Look of Flaming Fire, but she was
floating in a halo of pure white happiness and nothing could touch
her.</p>
<p>"<i>Do you realize what kind of week I've had?</i>" said Harry
Potter. "Any lesser being would have been hard-pressed to read
eight Dr. Seuss books!"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> set the time limit."</p>
<p>Harry's Look of Flaming Fire grew even hotter. "I did not have
any logical way of knowing I'd have to save the entire school from
Professor Snape, or get beaten up in Defense class, and if I told
you how I lost all the time between 5pm and dinner on Thursday you
would think I was insane -"</p>
<p>"Awww, it sounds like <i>someone</i> fell prey to the
<i>planning fallacy.</i>"</p>
<p>Raw shock showed on Harry Potter's face.</p>
<p>"Oh that reminds me, I finished reading the first batch of books
you lent me," Hermione said with her best innocent look. A couple
of them had been <i>hard</i> books, too. She wondered how long it
had taken <i>him</i> to finish reading them.</p>
<p>"Someday," said the Boy-Who-Lived, "when the distant descendants
of <i>Homo sapiens</i> are looking back over the history of the
galaxy and wondering how it all went so wrong, they will conclude
that the original mistake was when someone taught Hermione Granger
how to read."</p>
<p>"But you still lose," said Hermione. She held a hand to her chin
and looked contemplative. "Now what exactly should you lose, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>
<p>"You lost the bet," Hermione explained, "so you have to pay a
forfeit."</p>
<p>"I don't remember agreeing to this!"</p>
<p>"Really?" said Hermione Granger. She put a thoughtful look on
her face. Then, as if the idea had only just then occurred to her,
"We'll take a vote, then. Everyone in Ravenclaw who thinks Harry
Potter has to pay up, raise your hand!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" shrieked Harry Potter again.</p>
<p>He spun around and saw that he was surrounded by a sea of raised
hands.</p>
<p>And if Harry Potter had looked <i>more carefully</i>, he would
have noticed that an awful lot of the onlookers seemed to be girls
and that practically every female in the room had their hand
raised.</p>
<p>"Stop!" wailed Harry Potter. "You don't know what she's going to
ask! Don't you <i>realize</i> what she's doing? She's getting you
to make an advance commitment now, and then the pressure of
consistency will make you agree with whatever she says
afterward!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry," said the prefect Penelope Clearwater. "If she
asks for something unreasonable, we can just change our minds.
Right, everyone?"</p>
<p>And there were eager nods from all the girls whom Penelope
Clearwater had told about Hermione's plan.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A silent figure quietly slipped through the chilled halls of the
Hogwarts dungeons. He was to be present in a certain room at 6:00pm
to meet a certain someone, and if at all possible it was best to be
early, to show respect.</p>
<p>But when his hand turned the doorknob and opened the door into
that dark, silent, unused classroom, there was a silhouette already
standing there amid the rows of dusty old desks. A silhouette which
held a small green glowing rod, casting a pale light which hardly
illuminated even he who held it, let alone the surrounding
room.</p>
<p>The light of the hallway died as the door closed and shut behind
him, and Draco's eyes began the process of adjusting to the dim
glow.</p>
<p>The silhouette slowly turned to behold him, revealing a shadowed
face only partially lit by the eerie green light.</p>
<p>Draco liked this meeting already. Keep the chill green light,
make them both taller, give them hoods and masks, move them from a
classroom to a graveyard, and it would be just like the start of
half the stories his father's friends told about the Death
Eaters.</p>
<p>"I want you to know, Draco Malfoy," said the silhouette in tones
of deadly calm, "that I do not blame you for my recent defeat."</p>
<p>Draco opened his mouth in unthinking protest, there was no
possible reason why he <i>should</i> be blamed -</p>
<p>"It was due, more than anything else, to my own stupidity,"
continued that shadowy figure. "There were many other things I
could have done, at any step along the way. You did not ask me to
do <i>exactly</i> what I did. You only asked for help. I was the
one who unwisely chose that particular method. But the fact remains
that I lost the contest by half a book. The actions of your pet
idiot, and the favor you asked for, and, yes, my own foolishness in
going about it, caused me to <i>lose time</i>. More time than you
know. Time which, in the end, proved critical. The fact remains,
Draco Malfoy, that if you had not asked that favor, I <i>would</i>
have won. And not... instead... <i>lost</i>."</p>
<p>Draco had already heard about Harry's loss, and the forfeit
Granger had claimed from him. The news had spread faster than owls
could have carried it.</p>
<p>"I understand," Draco said. "I'm sorry." There was nothing else
he <i>could</i> say if he wanted Harry Potter to be friends with
him.</p>
<p>"I am not asking for understanding or sorrow," said the dark
silhouette, still with that deadly calm. "But I have just spent two
full hours in the presence of Hermione Granger, dressed in such
clothing as was provided me, visiting such fascinating places in
Hogwarts as a tiny burbling waterfall of what looked to me like
snot, accompanied by a number of other girls who insisted on such
helpful activities as strewing our path with Transfigured rose
petals. I have been on a date, scion of Malfoy. My <i>first</i>
date. <i>And when I call that favor due, you will pay it.</i>"</p>
<p>Draco nodded solemnly. Before arriving he had taken the wise
precaution of learning every available detail of Harry's date, so
that he could get all of his hysterical laughing done before their
appointed meeting time, and would not commit a <i>faux pas</i> by
giggling continuously until he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>"Do you think," Draco said, "that something sad ought to happen
to the Granger girl -"</p>
<p>"Spread the word in Slytherin that the Granger girl is
<i>mine</i> and anyone who meddles in <i>my</i> affairs will have
their remains scattered over an area wide enough to include twelve
different spoken languages. And since I am not in Gryffindor and I
use <i>cunning</i> rather than immediate frontal attacks, they
should not panic if I am seen smiling at her."</p>
<p>"Or if you're seen on a second date?" Draco said, allowing just
a tiny note of skepticism into his voice.</p>
<p>"<i>There will be no second date,</i>" said the green-lit
silhouette in a voice so fearsome that it sounded, not only like a
Death Eater, but like Amycus Carrow that one time just before
Father told him to stop it, he wasn't the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Of course it <i>was</i> still a young boy's high unbroken voice
and when you combined that with the <i>actual words</i>, well, it
just didn't work. If Harry Potter <i>did</i> become the next Dark
Lord someday, Draco would use a Pensieve to store a copy of this
memory somewhere safe, and Harry Potter would never dare betray
him.</p>
<p>"But let us talk of happier matters," said the green-shadowed
figure. "Let us talk of knowledge and of power. Draco Malfoy, let
us talk of Science."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco. "Let us speak."</p>
<p>Draco wondered how much of his own face could be seen, and how
much was in shadow, in that eerie green light.</p>
<p>And though Draco kept his face serious, there was a smile in his
heart.</p>
<p>He was <i>finally</i> having a real grownup conversation.</p>
<p>"I offer you power," said the shadowy figure, "and I will tell
you of that power and its price. The power comes from knowing the
shape of reality and so gaining control over it. What you
understand, you can command, and that is power enough to walk upon
the Moon. The price of that power is that you must learn to ask
questions of Nature, and far more difficult, accept Nature's
answers. You will do experiments, perform tests and see what
happens. And you must accept the meaning of those results when they
tell you that you are mistaken. You will have to <i>learn how to
lose</i>, not to me, but to Nature. When you find yourself arguing
with reality, you will have to let reality win. You will find this
painful, Draco Malfoy, and I do not know if you are strong in that
way. Knowing the price, is it still your wish to learn the human
power?"</p>
<p>Draco took a deep breath. He'd thought about this. And it was
hard to see how he could answer any other way. He'd been instructed
to take every avenue of friendship with Harry Potter. It was just
<i>learning,</i> he wasn't promising to <i>do</i> anything. He
could always stop the lessons at any time...</p>
<p>There were certainly any number of things about the situation
which made it look like a trap, but in all honesty, Draco didn't
see how this could go wrong.</p>
<p>Plus Draco did kind of want to rule the world.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Excellent," said the shadowy figure. "I have had something of a
<i>crowded week</i>, and it will take time to plan your curriculum
-"</p>
<p>"I've got a lot of things I need to do myself to consolidate my
power in Slytherin," said Draco, "not to mention homework. Maybe we
should just start in October?"</p>
<p>"Sounds sensible," said the shadowy figure, "but what I meant to
say is that to plan your curriculum, I need to know what I will be
teaching you. Three thoughts come to me. The first is that I teach
you of the human mind and brain. The second option is that I teach
you of the physical universe, those arts which lie on the pathway
to visiting the Moon. This involves a great deal of numbers, but to
a certain kind of mind those numbers are more beautiful than
anything else Science has to teach. Do you like numbers,
Draco?"</p>
<p>Draco shook his head.</p>
<p>"Then so much for that. You will learn your mathematics
eventually, but not right away, I think. The third option is that I
teach you of genetics and evolution and inheritance, what you would
call blood -"</p>
<p>"That one," said Draco.</p>
<p>The figure nodded. "I thought you might say as much. But I think
it will be the most painful path for you, Draco. What if your
family and friends, the blood purists, say one thing, and you find
that the experimental test says another?"</p>
<p>"Then I'll figure out how to make the experimental test say the
<i>right</i> answer!"</p>
<p>There was a pause, as the shadowy figure stood there with its
mouth open for a short while.</p>
<p>"Um," said the shadowy figure. "It doesn't really work like
that. That's what I was trying to warn you about here, Draco. You
<i>can't</i> make the answer come out to be anything you like."</p>
<p>"You can <i>always</i> make the answer come out your way," said
Draco. That had been practically the first thing his tutors had
taught him. "It's just a matter of finding the right
arguments."</p>
<p>"No," said the shadowy figure, voice rising in frustration, "no,
no, no! Then you get the <i>wrong answer</i> and you can't go to
the Moon that way! Nature isn't a person, you can't trick them into
believing something else, if you try to tell the Moon it's made of
cheese you can argue for days and it won't change the Moon! What
you're talking about is <i>rationalization</i>, like starting with
a sheet of paper, moving straight down to the bottom line, using
ink to write 'and <i>therefore,</i> the Moon is made of cheese',
and then moving back up to write all sorts of clever arguments
above. But either the Moon is made of cheese or it isn't. The
moment you wrote the bottom line, it was already true or already
false. Whether or not the whole sheet of paper ends up with the
right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixed the instant you
write down the bottom line. If you're trying to pick between two
expensive trunks, and you like the shiny one, it doesn't matter
what clever arguments you come up with for buying it, the
<i>real</i> rule you used to <i>choose which trunk to argue for</i>
was 'pick the shiny one', and however effective that rule is at
picking good trunks, that's the kind of trunk you'll get.
Rationality <i>can't</i> be used to argue for a fixed side, its
only possible use is <i>deciding which side to argue</i>. Science
isn't for <i>convincing</i> anyone that the blood purists are
right. That's <i>politics!</i> The power of science comes from
<i>finding out the way Nature really is that can't be changed by
arguing!</i> What science <i>can</i> do is tell us <i>how blood
really works,</i> how wizards really inherit their powers from
their parents, and whether Muggleborns are really weaker or
stronger -"</p>
<p>"<i>Stronger!</i>" said Draco. He had been trying to follow
this, a puzzled frown on his face, he could see how it <i>sort</i>
of made sense but it certainly wasn't like anything he'd ever heard
before. And then Harry Potter had said something Draco couldn't
possibly let pass. "You think mudbloods are <i>stronger?</i>"</p>
<p>"I think nothing," said the shadowy figure. "I know nothing. I
believe nothing. My bottom line is not yet written. I will figure
out how to test the magical strength of Muggleborns, and the
magical strength of purebloods. If my tests tell me that
Muggleborns are weaker, I will believe they are weaker. If my tests
tell me that Muggleborns are stronger, I will believe they are
stronger. Knowing this and other truths, I will gain some measure
of power -"</p>
<p>"And you expect <i>me</i> to believe whatever you say?" Draco
demanded hotly.</p>
<p>"I expect you to perform the tests <i>personally</i>," said the
shadowy figure quietly. "Are you afraid of what <i>you</i> will
find?"</p>
<p>Draco stared at the shadowy figure for a while, his eyes
narrowed. "Nice trap, Harry," he said. "I'll have to remember that
one, it's new."</p>
<p>The shadowy figure shook his head. "It's not a trap, Draco.
Remember - I <i>don't know</i> what we'll find. But you do not
understand the universe by arguing with it or telling it to come
back with a different answer next time. When you put on the robes
of a scientist you must forget all your politics and arguments and
factions and sides, silence the desperate clingings of your mind,
and wish only to hear the answer of Nature." The shadowy figure
paused. "Most people can't do it. That's why this is difficult. Are
you sure you wouldn't rather just learn about the brain?"</p>
<p>"And if I tell you I'd rather learn about the brain," Draco
said, his voice now hard, "you'll go around telling people that I
was afraid of what I'd find."</p>
<p>"No," said the shadowy figure. "I will do no such thing."</p>
<p>"But you might do the same sort of tests yourself, and if you
got the wrong answer, I wouldn't be there to say anything before
you showed it to someone else." Draco's voice was still hard.</p>
<p>"I would still ask you first, Draco," the shadowy figure said
quietly.</p>
<p>Draco paused. He hadn't been expecting that, he'd thought he saw
the trap but... "You <i>would?</i>"</p>
<p>"Of course. How would <i>I</i> know who to blackmail or what we
could ask from them? Draco, I say again that this is not a trap I
set for you. At least not for you personally. If your politics were
different, I would be saying, what if the test shows that
purebloods are stronger."</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"<i>Yes!</i> That's the price <i>anyone</i> has to pay to become
a scientist!"</p>
<p>Draco held up a hand. He had to think.</p>
<p>The shadowy, green-lit figure waited.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to think about, though. If you discarded all
the confusing parts... then Harry Potter was planning to mess
around with something that could cause a gigantic political
explosion, and it would be insane to just walk away and let him do
it on his own. "We'll study blood," said Draco.</p>
<p>"<i>Excellent</i>," said the figure, and smiled.
"Congratulations on being willing to ask the question."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Draco said, not quite managing to keep the irony out
of his voice.</p>
<p>"Hey, did you think going to the Moon was <i>easy?</i> Be glad
this just involves changing your mind sometimes, and not a human
sacrifice!"</p>
<p>"Human sacrifice would be <i>way</i> easier!"</p>
<p>There was a slight pause, and then the figure nodded. "Fair
point."</p>
<p>"Look, Harry," said Draco without much hope, "I thought the idea
was to take all the things that Muggles know, combine them with
things that wizards know, and become masters of both worlds.
Wouldn't it be a lot easier to just study all the things that
Muggles <i>already</i> found out, like the Moon stuff, and use
<i>that</i> power -"</p>
<p>"<i>No,</i>" said the figure with a sharp shake of his head,
sending green shadows moving around his nose and eyes. His voice
had turned very grim. "If you cannot learn the scientist's art of
accepting reality, then I <i>must not</i> tell you what that
acceptance has discovered. It would be like a powerful wizard
telling you of those gates which must not be opened, and those
seals which must not be broken, before you had proven your
intelligence and discipline by surviving the lesser perils."</p>
<p>A chill went down Draco's spine and he shuddered involuntarily.
He knew it had been visible even in the dim light. "All right,"
said Draco. "I understand." Father had told him that many times.
When a more powerful wizard told you that you weren't ready to
know, you didn't pry any further if you wanted to live.</p>
<p>The figure inclined his head. "Indeed. But there is something
else you should understand. The first scientists, being Muggles,
lacked your traditions. In the beginning they simply did not
comprehend the notion of dangerous knowledge, and thought that all
things known should be spoken freely. When their searches turned
dangerous, they told their politicians of things that should have
stayed secret - don't look like that, Draco, it wasn't simple
stupidity. They did have to be smart enough to uncover the secret
in the first place. But they were Muggles, it was the first time
they'd found anything <i>really</i> dangerous, and they didn't
<i>start out</i> with a tradition of secrecy. There was a war going
on, and the scientists on one side worried that if they
<i>didn't</i> talk, the scientists of the <i>enemy</i> country
would tell <i>their</i> politicians first..." The voice trailed off
significantly. "They didn't destroy the world. But it was close.
And <i>we</i> are not going to repeat that mistake."</p>
<p>"Right," Draco said, his voice now very firm. "<i>We</i> won't.
We're wizards, and studying science doesn't make us Muggles."</p>
<p>"As you say," said the green-lit silhouette. "We will establish
our <i>own</i> Science, a magical Science, and that Science will
have smarter traditions from the very start." The voice grew hard.
"The knowledge I share with you will be taught alongside the
disciplines of accepting truth, the level of this knowledge will be
keyed to your progress in those disciplines, and you will share
that knowledge with no one else who has not learned those
disciplines. Do you accept this?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco. What was he supposed to do, say no?</p>
<p>"Good. And what you discover for yourself, you will keep to
yourself unless you think that other scientists are ready to know
it. What we do share among ourselves, we will not tell the world
unless we agree it is safe for the world to know. And whatever our
own politics and allegiances, we will <i>all</i> punish <i>any</i>
of our number who reveal dangerous magics or give away dangerous
weapons, no matter what sort of war is going on. From this day
onward, that will be the tradition and the law of science among
wizards. Are we agreed on that?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Draco. Actually this <i>was</i> starting to sound
pretty attractive. The Death Eaters had tried to take power by
being scarier than everyone else, and they hadn't actually won yet.
Maybe it was time to try ruling using secrets instead. "And our
group stays hidden for as long as possible, and everyone in it has
to agree to our rules."</p>
<p>"Of course. Definitely."</p>
<p>There was a very short pause.</p>
<p>"We're going to need better robes," said the shadowy figure,
"with hoods and so on -"</p>
<p>"I was <i>just thinking</i> that," said Draco. "We don't need
whole new robes, though, just cowled cloaks to put on. I have a
friend in Slytherin, she'll take your measurements -"</p>
<p>"Don't tell her what it's <i>for</i>, though -"</p>
<p>"I'm not <i>stupid!</i>"</p>
<p>"And no masks for now, not when it's just you and me -" said the
shadowy figure.</p>
<p>"Right! But later on we should have some sort of special mark
that all our servants have, the Mark of Science, like a snake
eating the Moon on their right arms -"</p>
<p>"It's called a PhD and wouldn't that make it too easy to
identify our people?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I mean, what if someone is like 'okay, now everyone pull up
their robes over their right arms' and our guy is like 'whoops,
sorry, looks like I'm a spy' -"</p>
<p><i>"Forget I said anything,</i>" said Draco, sweat suddenly
springing out all over his body. He needed a distraction,
<i>fast</i> - "And what do we call ourselves? The Science
Eaters?"</p>
<p>"No," said the shadowy figure slowly. "That doesn't sound
right..."</p>
<p>Draco wiped his robed arm across his forehead, wiping away beads
of moisture. What had the Dark Lord been <i>thinking?</i> Father
had said the Dark Lord was <i>smart!</i></p>
<p>"I've got it!" said the shadowy figure suddenly. "You won't
understand yet, but trust me, it fits."</p>
<p>Right now Draco would have accepted 'Malfoy Munchers' as long as
it changed the subject. "What is it?"</p>
<p>And standing amid the dusty desks in an unused classroom in the
dungeons of Hogwarts, the green-lit silhouette of Harry Potter
spread his arms dramatically and said, "This day shall mark the
dawn of... the <i>Bayesian Conspiracy</i>."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A silent figure trudged wearily through the halls of Hogwarts in
the direction of Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Harry had gone straight from the meeting with Draco to dinner,
and stayed at dinner barely long enough to choke down a few fast
gulps of food before going off to bed.</p>
<p>It wasn't even 7pm yet, but it was well past bedtime for Harry.
He'd realized <i>last</i> night that he wouldn't be able to use the
Time-Turner on Saturday until after the book-reading contest was
already over. But he could still use the Time-Turner on
<i>Friday</i> night, and gain time that way. So Harry had pushed
himself to stay awake until 9pm on Friday, when the protective
shell opened, and then used the four hours remaining on the
Time-Turner to spin back to 5pm and collapse into sleep. He'd woken
up around 2am on Saturday morning, just as planned, and read for
the next twelve hours straight... and it still hadn't been enough.
And now Harry would be going to sleep rather early for the next few
days, until his sleep cycle caught up again.</p>
<p>The portrait on the door asked Harry some dumb riddle meant for
eleven-year-olds that he answered without the words even passing
through his conscious mind, and then Harry staggered up the stairs
to his dorm room, changed into his pajamas and collapsed into
bed.</p>
<p>And found that his pillow seemed rather lumpy.</p>
<p>Harry groaned. He sat up reluctantly, twisted in bed, and lifted
up his pillow.</p>
<p>This revealed a note, two golden Galleons, and a book titled
<i>Occlumency: The Hidden Arte.</i></p>
<p>Harry picked up the note and read:</p>
<p><i>My, you do get yourself into trouble and quickly. Your father
was no match for you.</i></p>
<p><i>You have made a powerful enemy. Snape commands the loyalty,
admiration, and fear of all House Slytherin. You cannot trust any
of that House now, whether they come to you in friendly guise or
fearsome.</i></p>
<p><i>From now on you must not meet Snape's eyes. He is a
Legilimens and can read your mind if you do. I have enclosed a book
which may help you learn to protect yourself, though there is only
so far you can get without a tutor. Still you may hope to at least
detect intrusion.</i></p>
<p><i>So that you may find some extra time in which to study
Occlumency, I have enclosed 2 Galleons, which is the price of
answer sheets and homework for the first-year History of Magic
class (Professor Binns having given the same tests and same
assignments every year since he died). Your newfound friends the
Weasley twins should be able to sell you a copy. It goes without
saying that you must not get caught with it in your
possession.</i></p>
<p><i>Of Professor Quirrell I know little. He is a Slytherin and a
Defense Professor, and that is two marks against him. Consider
carefully any advice he gives you, and tell him nothing you do not
wish known.</i></p>
<p><i>Dumbledore only pretends to be insane. He is extremely
intelligent, and if you continue to step into closets and vanish,
he will certainly deduce your possession of an invisibility cloak
if he has not done so already. Avoid him whenever possible, hide
the Cloak of Invisibility somewhere safe (NOT your pouch) any time
you cannot avoid him, and step with great care in his
presence.</i></p>
<p><i>Please be more careful in the future, Harry Potter.</i></p>
<p><i>- Santa Claus</i></p>
<p>Harry stared at the note.</p>
<p>It <i>did</i> seem to be pretty good advice. Of course Harry
wasn't going to cheat in History class even if they gave him a dead
monkey for a professor. But Severus's Legilimency... whoever'd sent
this note knew a lot of important, secret things and was willing to
tell Harry about them. The note was still warning him against
Dumbledore stealing the Cloak but at this point Harry honestly had
no clue if that was a bad sign, it could just be an understandable
mistake.</p>
<p>There seemed to be some sort of intrigue going on inside
Hogwarts. Maybe if Harry <i>compared stories</i> between Dumbledore
and the note-sender, he could work out a <i>combined</i> picture
that would be accurate? Like if they <i>both</i> agreed on
something, then...</p>
<p>...whatever...</p>
<p>Harry stuffed everything into his pouch and turned up the
Quieter and pulled the cover over his head and died.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was Sunday morning and Harry was eating pancakes in the Great
Hall, sharp quick bites, glancing nervously at his watch every few
seconds.</p>
<p>It was 8:02am, and in precisely two hours and one minute, it
would be <i>exactly one week</i> since he'd seen the Weasleys and
crossed over onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.</p>
<p>And the thought had occurred to him... Harry didn't know if this
was a valid way to think about the universe, he didn't know
anything any more, but it <i>seemed possible...</i></p>
<p>That...</p>
<p><i>Not enough interesting things had happened to him over the
last week.</i></p>
<p>When he was done eating breakfast, Harry planned to go straight
up to his room and hide in the bottom level of his trunk and not
talk to anyone until 10:03am.</p>
<p>And that was when Harry saw the Weasley twins walking toward
him. One of them was carrying something concealed behind his
back.</p>
<p>He should scream and run away.</p>
<p>He should scream and run away.</p>
<p>Whatever this was... it could very well be...</p>
<p>...the <i>grand finale...</i></p>
<p>He really should just scream and run away.</p>
<p>With a resigned feeling that the universe would come and get him
<i>anyway</i>, Harry continued slicing at the pancake with his fork
and knife. He couldn't muster the energy. That was the sad truth.
Harry knew now how people felt when they were tired of running,
tired of trying to escape fate, and they just fell to the ground
and let the horrifically befanged and tentacled demons of the
darkest abyss drag them off to their unspeakable destiny.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins drew closer.</p>
<p>And yet closer.</p>
<p>Harry ate another bite of pancake.</p>
<p>The Weasley twins arrived, grinning brightly.</p>
<p>"Hello, Fred," Harry said dully. One of the twins nodded.
"Hello, George." The other twin nodded.</p>
<p>"You sound tired," said George.</p>
<p>"You should cheer up," said Fred.</p>
<p>"Look what <i>we</i> got you!"</p>
<p>And George took, from behind Fred's back -</p>
<p>A cake with twelve flaming candles.</p>
<p>There was a pause, as the Ravenclaw table stared at them.</p>
<p>"That's not right," said someone. "Harry Potter was born on the
thirty-first of Jul-"</p>
<p>"<i>HE IS COMING</i>," said a huge hollow voice that cut through
all conversation like a sword of ice. "<i>THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR
APART THE VERY -</i>"</p>
<p>Dumbledore had leapt out of his throne and run straight over the
Head Table and seized hold of the woman speaking those awful words,
Fawkes had appeared in a flash, and all three of them vanished in a
crack of fire.</p>
<p>There was a shocked pause...</p>
<p>...followed by heads turning in the direction of Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>"I didn't do it," Harry said in a tired voice.</p>
<p>"That was a <i>prophecy!</i>" someone at the table hissed. "And
I bet it's about <i>you!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry sighed.</p>
<p>He stood up from his seat, raised his voice, and said very
loudly over the conversations that were starting up, "<i>It's not
about me! Obviously! I'm not coming here, I'm already
here!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry sat back down again.</p>
<p>The people who had been looking at him turned away again.</p>
<p>Someone else at the table said, "Then who <i>is</i> it
about?"</p>
<p>And with a dull, leaden sensation, Harry realized who
<i>wasn't</i> already at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Call it a wild guess, but Harry had a feeling the undead Dark
Lord would be showing up one of these days.</p>
<p>The conversation continued on around him.</p>
<p>"Not to mention, tear apart the very <i>what?</i>"</p>
<p>"I thought I heard Trelawney start to say something with an 'S'
just before the Headmaster grabbed her."</p>
<p>"Like... soul? Sun?"</p>
<p>"If someone's going to tear apart the Sun we're <i>really</i> in
trouble!"</p>
<p>That seemed rather unlikely to Harry, unless the world contained
scary things which had heard of David Criswell's ideas about star
lifting.</p>
<p>"So," Harry said in tired tones, "this happens every Sunday
breakfast, does it?"</p>
<p>"No," said a student who might have been in his seventh year,
frowning grimly. "It doesn't."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Whatever. Anyone want some birthday cake?"</p>
<p>"But it's <i>not</i> your birthday!" said the same student who'd
objected last time.</p>
<p>That was the cue for Fred and George to start laughing, of
course.</p>
<p>Even Harry managed a weary smile.</p>
<p>As the first slice was served to him, Harry said, "I've had a
<i>really long week</i>."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid
shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his
head, waiting for the week to be over.</p>
<p>10:01.</p>
<p>10:02.</p>
<p>10:03, but just to be sure...</p>
<p>10:04 and the first week was done.</p>
<p>Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket
off of his head.</p>
<p>A few moments later, he had emerged into the bright sunlit air
of his dorm.</p>
<p>Shortly after, and he was in the Ravenclaw common room. A few
people looked at him, but no one said anything or tried to talk to
him.</p>
<p>Harry found a nice wide writing desk, pulled back a comfortable
chair, and sat down. From his pouch he drew a sheet of paper and a
pencil.</p>
<p>Mum and Dad had told Harry in no uncertain terms that while they
understood his enthusiasm for leaving home and getting away from
his parents, he was to write them <i>every week without fail</i>,
just so that they knew he was alive, unharmed, and not in
prison.</p>
<p>Harry stared down at the blank sheet of paper. <i>Let's
see...</i></p>
<p>After leaving his parents at the train station, he'd...</p>
<p>...gotten acquainted with a boy raised by Darth Vader, become
friends with the three most infamous pranksters in Hogwarts, met
Hermione, then there'd been the Incident with the Sorting Hat...
Monday he'd been given a time machine to treat his sleep disorder,
gotten a legendary invisibility cloak from an unknown benefactor,
rescued seven Hufflepuffs by staring down five scary older boys one
of whom had threatened to break his finger, realized that he
possessed a mysterious dark side, learned to cast <i>Frigideiro</i>
in Charms class, and gotten started on his rivalry with Hermione...
Tuesday had introduced Astronomy taught by Professor Aurora
Sinistra who was nice, and History of Magic taught by a ghost who
ought to be exorcised and replaced with a tape recorder...
Wednesday, he'd been pronounced the Most Dangerous Student in the
Classroom... Thursday, let's not even think about Thursday...
Friday, the Incident in Potions Class, followed by his blackmailing
the Headmaster, followed by the Defense Professor having him beaten
up in class, followed by the Defense Professor turning out to be
the most awesome human being who still walked the face of the
Earth... Saturday he'd lost a bet and gone on his first date and
started redeeming Draco... and then this morning Professor
Trelawney's unheard prophecy might or might not indicate that an
immortal Dark Lord was about to attack Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry mentally organized his material, and started writing.</p>
<p><i>Dear Mum and Dad:</i></p>
<p><i>Hogwarts is lots of fun. I learned how to violate the Second
Law of Thermodynamics in Charms class, and I met a girl named
Hermione Granger who reads faster than I do.</i></p>
<p><i>I'd better leave it at that.</i></p>
<p><i>Your loving son,<br />
Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.</i></p>
