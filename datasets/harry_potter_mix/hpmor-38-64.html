<h1>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</h1>
<p class="credits">by LessWrong</p>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="38">Chapter 38</h2><h3>The Cardinal Sin</h3>
<p>Bright the sun, bright the air, bright the students and bright
their parents, clean the paved ground of Platform 9.75, the winter
Sun hanging low in the sky at 9:45AM in the morning on January 5th,
1992. Some of the younger students wore scarves and mittens, but
most simply wore their robes; they were wizards, after all.</p>
<p>After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took
off his scarf and coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and
stowed away his winter things.</p>
<p>For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite
at him, just to see what it was like.</p>
<p>Harry took out his wizards' robes, shrugged them on.</p>
<p>And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn't help thinking
of the parents he'd only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose
problems he was leaving behind...</p>
<p>With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said,
"<i>Thermos.</i>"</p>
<p>The warmth flowed through him.</p>
<p>And the Boy-Who-Lived was back.</p>
<p>Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anything
else at the conclusion of his vacation. He didn't feel like reading
his textbooks, or even any serious science fiction, this morning;
what he needed was something completely frivolous to occupy his
attention...</p>
<p>Well, that wouldn't be hard to come by, if he was willing to
part with four Knuts.</p>
<p>Besides, if the <i>Daily Prophet</i> was corrupt and the
<i>Quibbler</i> was the only competing newspaper, there might be
some suppressed real news in there.</p>
<p>Harry trudged back over to the same newsstand from last time,
wondering if the <i>Quibbler</i> could top the headline he'd seen
before.</p>
<p>The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the
man's face suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry Potter?</i>" gasped the vendor.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Durian," said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man's
nametag, "just an amazing imitation -"</p>
<p>And then Harry's voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight
of the top fold of the <i>Quibbler.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:<br />
DARK LORD TO RETURN,</i></p>
<p>For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face,
before realizing that <i>not</i> being shocked could be just as
revealing, in a sense -</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and
he didn't even know whether that was too revealing, or just what
his normal reaction <i>would</i> be if he didn't know anything.
He'd spent too much time around Slytherins, he was forgetting how
to keep secrets from ordinary people. Four Knuts hit the counter.
"One copy of the <i>Quibbler,</i> please."</p>
<p>"Oh, no worries, Mr. Potter!" said the vendor hastily, waving
his hands. "It's - never mind, just -"</p>
<p>A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry's fingers, and he
unfolded it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:<br />
DARK LORD TO RETURN,<br />
WED DRACO MALFOY</i></p>
<p>"It's free," said the vendor, "for <i>you</i>, I mean -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said, "I was going to buy one anyway."</p>
<p>The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on.</p>
<p>"Gosh," Harry said half a minute later, "you get a seer smashed
on six slugs of Scotch and she spills all <i>sorts</i> of secret
stuff. I mean, who'd have thought that Sirius Black and Peter
Pettigrew were secretly the same person?"</p>
<p>"Not me," said the vendor.</p>
<p>"They've even got a picture of the two of them together, so we
know who it is that's secretly the same person."</p>
<p>"Yup," said the vendor. "Pretty clever disguise, innit?"</p>
<p>"And I'm secretly sixty-five years old."</p>
<p>"You don't look half that," the vendor said amiably.</p>
<p>"And I'm betrothed to Hermione Granger, <i>and</i> Bellatrix
Black, <i>and</i> Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy
too..."</p>
<p>"Goin' ter be one interesting wedding," said the vendor.</p>
<p>Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant
voice, "You know, I heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane,
and I wondered if she really was, or if she was just making stuff
up and giggling to herself the whole time. Then when I read my
second <i>Quibbler</i> headline, I decided that she <i>couldn't</i>
be insane, I mean, it can't be <i>easy</i> to make this stuff up,
you couldn't do it by <i>accident</i>. And <i>now</i> do you know
what I think? I think she must be mad after all. When ordinary
people try to make stuff up, it doesn't come out like <i>this</i>.
Something's got to go really <i>wrong</i> with the inside of your
head before <i>this</i> is what comes out when you start making
stuff up!"</p>
<p>The vendor stared at Harry.</p>
<p>"Seriously," said Harry. "Who <i>reads</i> this stuff?"</p>
<p>"You," said the vendor.</p>
<p>Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.</p>
<p>He didn't sit at the same nearby table he'd sat down at with
Draco, the <i>first</i> time he'd prepared to board this train.
That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.</p>
<p>It wasn't <i>just</i> that his first week at Hogwarts had been,
judging by the <i>Quibbler</i>, fifty-four years long. It was that,
in Harry's humble opinion, his life did not <i>need</i> any new
threads of complexity.</p>
<p>So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from
the main crowd and the occasional muffled cracks of parents
Apparating in with their children, and sat down and read the
<i>Quibbler</i> to see if it contained any suppressed news.</p>
<p>And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any
of <i>that</i> was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic
gossip; but nothing that would really be all that <i>important</i>
if it was true.</p>
<p>Harry was just reading about the Ministry's proposed marriage
law, to ban all marriages, when -</p>
<p>"Harry Potter," said a silken voice that sent a shock of
adrenaline jolting through Harry's blood.</p>
<p>Harry looked up.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy," Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was
going to do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of
King's Cross until 10:55am.</p>
<p>Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white
hair drifting over his shoulders. The man was still carrying that
same cane, lacquered in black with a silver snake's head for its
handle; and something about his grip silently said <i>this is a
weapon of deadly power,</i> not <i>I am feeble and leaning on
this.</i> His face was expressionless.</p>
<p>Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their
wands already gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved
like a single organism with four legs and four arms, the senior
Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could guess which was which,
but then it didn't really matter. They were merely Lucius's
appendages, as certainly as if they'd been the two rightmost toes
on his left foot.</p>
<p>"I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter," said the smooth,
silken voice. "But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I
thought, might be my only opportunity to meet you."</p>
<p>"I have received none of your owls," Harry said calmly.
"Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume. But I would not have
answered them if I had, except through Draco. For me to deal with
you directly, without Draco's knowledge, would trespass on our
friendship."</p>
<p><i>Please go away, please go away...</i></p>
<p>The grey eyes glittered at him. "Is that your pose, then..."
said the senior Malfoy. "Well. I shall play along a little. What
was your purpose in maneuvering your good friend, my son, into a
public alliance with that girl?"</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said lightly, "that's obvious, right? Draco's
working with Granger will make him realize that Muggleborns are
human after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha."</p>
<p>A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius's lips. "Yes, that
does sound like one of Dumbledore's plans. Which it is
<i>not</i>."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Harry. "It is part of my game with Draco, and no
work of Dumbledore's, and that is all I will say."</p>
<p>"Let us dispense with games," said the senior Malfoy, the grey
eyes suddenly hardening. "If my suspicions are true, you would
hardly do Dumbledore's bidding in any case, <i>Mr. Potter.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"So you know," Harry said, his voice cold. "Tell me. At which
point, exactly, did you realize?"</p>
<p>"When I read your response to Professor Quirrell's little
speech," said the white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. "I was
puzzled, at first, for it seemed not in your own interest; it took
me days to understand whose interest was being served, and then it
all finally became clear. And it is also obvious that you are weak,
in some ways if not others."</p>
<p>"Very clever of you," said Harry, still cold. "But perhaps you
mistake my interests."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I do." A hint of steel came into the silken voice.
"Indeed, that is precisely what I fear. You are playing strange
games with my son, to a purpose I cannot guess. That is not a
friendly act, and you cannot but <i>expect</i> me to be
concerned!"</p>
<p>Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both
those hands white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.</p>
<p>Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad
idea to show his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be
intimidated. They were in a public train station anyway -</p>
<p>"I find it interesting," Harry said, putting steel into his own
voice, "that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But
it is irrelevant, Lucius. <i>He</i> is my friend, and I do not
betray my friends."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer
shock.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"Company," said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the
voice, that it must be the senior Crabbe.</p>
<p>Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of
disapproval.</p>
<p>Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow
behind a tall woman who didn't look scared at all.</p>
<p>"Madam Longbottom," Lucius said icily.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy," returned the woman with equal ice. "Are you being
an annoyance to our Harry Potter?"</p>
<p>The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely
bitter. "Oh, I rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have
you?" The white-haired head shifted toward Neville. "And this would
be Mr. Potter's loyal lieutenant, the last scion of Longbottom,
Neville, self-styled of Chaos. How strangely does the world turn.
Sometimes I think it must all be mad."</p>
<p>Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked
confused, and frightened.</p>
<p>"I doubt it is the world that is mad," said Madam Longbottom.
Her voice took on a gloating tone. "You seem in a poor mood, Mr.
Malfoy. Did the speech of our dear Professor Quirrell cost you a
few allies?"</p>
<p>"It was a clever enough slander of my abilities," Lucius said
coldly, "though only effective upon the fools who believe that I
was truly a Death Eater."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" blurted Neville.</p>
<p>"I was under the <i>Imperius,</i> young man," said Lucius, now
sounding tired. "The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting
among pureblood families without the support of House Malfoy. I
demurred, and he simply made sure of me. His own Death Eaters did
not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though
since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me. Some of the
Death Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number, and
for the peace of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them
controlled. But I was not such a fool as to support that ill-fated
adventurer of my own choice -"</p>
<p>"Ignore him," Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed
to Harry as well as Neville. "He must spend the rest of his life
pretending, for fear of your testimony under Veritaseum." Said with
malicious satisfaction.</p>
<p>Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry
again. "Will you request this harridan to depart, <i>Mr.
Potter?</i>"</p>
<p>"I think not," said Harry in a dry voice. "I prefer to deal with
the part of House Malfoy that's my own age."</p>
<p>There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.</p>
<p>"Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I <i>do</i> feel the fool
now. This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what
we were talking about."</p>
<p>Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.</p>
<p>Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on
the ground.</p>
<p>The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there
was nothing in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the
snake-headed cane.</p>
<p>"My son is my heart," said the senior Malfoy, "the last
worthwhile thing I have left in this world, and this I say to you
in a spirit of friendship: if he were to come to harm, I would give
my life over to vengeance. But so long as my son does <i>not</i>
come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. And as
you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of
you."</p>
<p>Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam
Longbottom being blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe;
her wand was in her hand, now.</p>
<p>"How <i>dare</i> you!" she hissed.</p>
<p>Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as
he turned to the senior Goyle. "We return to Malfoy Manor."</p>
<p>There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.</p>
<p>A silence followed.</p>
<p>"Dear <i>heavens</i>," said Madam Longbottom. "What was that
about?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville.</p>
<p>There was sweat on Neville's forehead.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, Neville," said Harry. "Your help was
greatly appreciated, Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should
sit down."</p>
<p>"Yes, General," said Neville, and instead of coming over to one
of the other chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting
position on the pavement.</p>
<p>"You have wrought many changes in my grandson," said Madam
Longbottom. "I approve of some, but not others."</p>
<p>"Send me the list of which is which," said Harry. "I'll see what
I can do."</p>
<p>Neville groaned, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. "I shall, young man, thank
you." Her voice lowered. "Mr. Potter... the speech given by
Professor Quirrell is something our nation has long needed to hear.
I cannot say as much of your comment on it."</p>
<p>"I will take your opinion under advisement," Harry said
mildly.</p>
<p>"I dearly hope that you do," said Madam Longbottom, and turned
back to her grandson. "Do I still need to -"</p>
<p>"It's okay for you to go, Granma," said Neville. "I'll be fine
on my own, this time."</p>
<p>"Now <i>that</i> I approve of," she said, and popped and
vanished like a soap bubble.</p>
<p>The two boys sat quietly for a moment.</p>
<p>Neville spoke first, his voice weary. "You're going to try to
fix all the changes she <i>approves</i> of, right?"</p>
<p>"Not <i>all</i> of them," Harry said innocently. "I just want to
make sure I'm not corrupting you."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco looked <i>very</i> worried. His head kept darting around,
despite the fact that Draco had insisted on them going down into
Harry's trunk, and using a true Quieting Charm and not just the
sound-blurring barrier.</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> did you say to Father?" blurted Draco, the moment
the Quieting Charm went up and the sounds of Platform 9 3/4
vanished.</p>
<p>"I... look, can you tell me what he said to <i>you,</i> before
he dropped you off?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"That I should tell him right away if you seemed to be
threatening me," said Draco. "That I should tell him right away if
there was anything <i>I</i> was doing that could pose a threat to
<i>you!</i> Father thinks you're <i>dangerous,</i> Harry, whatever
you said to him today it <i>scared</i> him! <i>It's not a good idea
to scare Father!</i>"</p>
<p><i>Oh, hell...</i></p>
<p>"<i>What</i> did you talk about?" demanded Draco.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at
the bottom of his trunk's cavern. "You know, Draco, just as the
fundamental question of rationality is 'What do I think I know and
how do I think I know it?', there's also a cardinal sin, a way of
thinking that's the opposite of that. Like the ancient Greek
philosophers. They had no clue what was going on, so they'd go
around saying things like 'All is water' or 'All is fire', and they
never asked themselves, 'Wait a minute, even if everything
<i>is</i> water, how could I possibly <i>know</i> that?' They
didn't ask themselves if they had evidence which discriminated
<i>that</i> possibility from all the <i>other</i> possibilities you
could imagine, evidence they'd be very unlikely to encounter if the
theory <i>wasn't</i> true -"</p>
<p>"<i>Harry</i>," Draco said, his voice strained, "<i>What did you
talk about with Father?</i>"</p>
<p>"I don't know, actually," said Harry, "so it's very important
that I <i>not</i> just make stuff up -"</p>
<p>Harry had never heard Draco shriek in horror in quite that high
a pitch before.</p>

1</h3>
<p>Whistle. Tick. Bzzzt. Ding. Glorp. Pop. Splat. Chime. Toot.

Whirr.</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick had silently passed Harry a folded parchment
during Charms class that Monday, and the note had said that Harry
was to visit the Headmaster at his convenience and in such fashion
that no one else would notice, especially not Draco Malfoy or
Professor Quirrell. His one-time password for the gargoyle would be
"squeamish ossifrage". This had been accompanied by a remarkably
artistic ink drawing of Professor Flitwick staring at him sternly,
the eyes of which occasionally blinked; and at the bottom of the
note, underlined three times, was the phrase DON'T GET INTO
TROUBLE.</p>
<p>And so Harry had finished up Transfiguration class, and studied
with Hermione, and eaten dinner, and spoken with his lieutenants,
and finally, when the clock struck nine, turned himself invisible
and dropped back to 6PM and wearily trudged off toward the
gargoyle, the turning spiral stairs, the wooden door, the room full
of little fiddly things, and the silver-bearded figure of the
Headmaster.</p>
<p>This time, Dumbledore looked quite serious, the customary smile
absent; and he was dressed in pajamas of a darker and more sober
purple than usual.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming, Harry," said the Headmaster. The old
wizard rose from his throne, began to slowly pace through the room
and the strange devices. "First, do you have with you the notes of
yesterday's encounter with Lucius Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Notes?" blurted Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>Surely</i> you wrote it down..." said the old wizard, and
his voice trailed off.</p>
<p>Harry felt rather embarrassed. Yes, if you'd just fumbled
through a mysterious conversation full of significant hints you
didn't understand, the <i>bloody obvious</i> thing to do would be
to write it all down immediately afterward, before the memory
faded, so you could try to figure it out later.</p>
<p>"All right," said the Headmaster, "from memory then."</p>
<p>Harry sheepishly recited as best he could, and got almost
halfway through before he realized that it wasn't smart to just go
around telling the possibly-crazy Headmaster everything, at least
not without <i>thinking</i> about it first, but then Lucius was
<i>definitely</i> a bad guy and Dumbledore's opponent so it
probably <i>was</i> a good idea to tell him, and Harry had already
started talking and it was too late to try and calculate things out
now...</p>
<p>Harry finished his recollections honestly.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's face had grown more remote as Harry went on, and at
the end there was a look of ancientness about him, a sternness in
the air.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dumbledore. "I suggest you take the best of care
that the heir of Malfoy does <i>not</i> come to harm, then. And I
will do the same." The Headmaster was frowning, his fingers
drumming soundlessly through the inky black surface of a plate
inscribed with the word <i>Leliel.</i> "And I think it would be
most extremely wise for you to avoid <i>all</i> interaction with
Lord Malfoy henceforth."</p>
<p>"<i>Did</i> you intercept owls from him to me?" said Harry.</p>
<p>The Headmaster gazed at Harry for a long moment, then
reluctantly nodded.</p>
<p>For some reason Harry wasn't feeling as outraged as he should
have been. Maybe it was just that Harry was finding it very easy to
sympathize with the Headmaster's point of view right now. Even
Harry could understand why Dumbledore wouldn't want him to interact
with Lucius Malfoy; it didn't seem like an <i>evil</i> deed.</p>
<p>Not like the Headmaster blackmailing Zabini... for which they
had only Zabini's word, and Zabini was wildly untrustworthy, in
fact it was hard to see why Zabini <i>wouldn't</i> just tell the
story that got him the most sympathy from Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p>"How about if, instead of protesting, I say that I understand
your point of view," said Harry, "and you go on intercepting my
owls, but you tell me who from?"</p>
<p>"I have intercepted a great many owls to you, I am afraid,"
Dumbledore said soberly. "You are a celebrity, Harry, and you would
receive dozens of letters a day, some from far outside this
country, did I not turn them back."</p>
<p>"<i>That</i>," Harry said, now starting to feel a bit of
indignation, "seems like going a little too far -"</p>
<p>"Many of those letters," the old wizard said quietly, "will be
asking you for things you cannot give. I have not read them, of
course, only turned them back to their senders undelivered. But I
know, for I receive them too. And you are too young, Harry, to have
your heart broken six times before breakfast each morning."</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his shoes. He <i>should</i> insist on
reading the letters and judging for himself, but... there was a
small voice of common sense inside him, and it was screaming very
loudly right now.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry muttered.</p>
<p>"The other reason I asked you here," said the old wizard, "was
that I wished to consult your unique genius."</p>
<p>"Transfiguration?" said Harry, surprised and flattered.</p>
<p>"No, not <i>that</i> unique genius," said Dumbledore. "Tell me,
Harry, what evil could you accomplish if a Dementor were allowed
onto the grounds of Hogwarts?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It developed that Professor Quirrell had asked, or rather
demanded, that his students test their skills against an actual
Dementor after they learned the words and gestures to the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell is unable to cast the Patronus Charm
himself," said Dumbledore, as he paced slowly through the devices.
"Which is never a good sign. But then, he <i>volunteered</i> that
fact to me in the course of demanding that outside instructors be
brought in to teach the Patronus Charm to every student who wished
to learn; he offered to pay the expense himself, if I would not.
This impressed me greatly. But now he insists on bringing in a
Dementor -"</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said quietly, "Professor Quirrell believes
<i>very</i> strongly in live-fire tests under realistic combat
conditions. Wanting to bring in an actual Dementor is
<i>completely</i> in character for him."</p>
<p>Now the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look.</p>
<p>"<i>In character?</i>" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>"I mean," said Harry, "it's entirely consistent with the way
Professor Quirrell usually acts..." Harry trailed off. Why
<i>had</i> he put it that way?</p>
<p>The Headmaster nodded. "So you have the same sense I do; that it
is an excuse. A very <i>reasonable</i> excuse, to be sure; more so
than you may realize. Often, wizards seemingly unable to cast a
Patronus Charm will succeed in the presence of an actual Dementor,
going from not a single flicker of light to a full corporeal
Patronus. Why this should be, no one knows; but it is so."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "Then I really don't see why you're suspicious
-"</p>
<p>The Headmaster spread his hands as though in helplessness.
"Harry, the <i>Defense Professor</i> has asked me to pass the
darkest of all creatures through the gates of Hogwarts. I
<i>must</i> be suspicious." The Headmaster sighed. "And yet the
Dementor will be guarded, warded, in a mighty cage, I will be there
myself to watch it at all times - I cannot think of what ill
<i>could</i> be done. But perhaps I am merely unable to see it. And
so I am asking you."</p>
<p>Harry stared at the Headmaster with his mouth open. He was so
shocked he couldn't even feel flattered.</p>
<p>"<i>Me?</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. "I try my best to
anticipate my foes, to encompass their wicked minds and predict
their evil thoughts. But <i>I</i> would never have imagined
sharpening a Hufflepuff's bones into weapons."</p>
<p>Was Harry <i>ever</i> going to live that down?</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said wearily, "I know it doesn't sound good,
but in all seriousness: I'm not evil, I'm just very creative -"</p>
<p>"I did not say that you were evil," Dumbledore said seriously.
"There are those who say that to comprehend evil is to become evil;
but they are merely pretending to be wise. Rather it is evil which
does not know love, and dares not imagine love, and cannot ever
understand love without ceasing to be evil. And I suspect that you
can imagine your way into the minds of Dark Wizards better than I
ever could, while still knowing love yourself. So, Harry." The
Headmaster's eyes were intent. "If you stood in Professor
Quirrell's shoes, what misdeeds could you accomplish after you
tricked me into allowing a Dementor onto the grounds of
Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>"Hold <i>on</i>," said Harry, and in something of a daze trudged
over to the chair in front of the Headmaster's desk, and sat down.
It was a large and comfortable chair this time, not a wooden stool,
and Harry could feel himself enveloped as he sank into it.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was asking him to outwit Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Point one: Harry was rather fonder of Professor Quirrell than of
Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Point two: The hypothesis was that the Defense Professor was
planning to do something evil, and in that subjunctive case, Harry
<i>ought</i> to be helping the Headmaster prevent it.</p>
<p>Point three...</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, "if Professor Quirrell <i>is</i> up to
something, I'm not sure I <i>can</i> outwit him. He's got a lot
more experience than I do."</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head, somehow managing to appear very
solemn despite his smile. "You underestimate yourself."</p>
<p>That was the first time anyone had ever said <i>that</i> to
Harry.</p>
<p>"I remember," the old wizard continued, "a young man in this
very office, cold and controlled as he faced down the Head of House
Slytherin, blackmailing his own Headmaster to protect his
classmates. And I believe that young man is more cunning than
Professor Quirrell, more cunning than Lucius Malfoy, that he will
grow to be the equal of Voldemort himself. It is he who I wish to
consult."</p>
<p>Harry suppressed the chill that went through him at the name,
frowned thoughtfully at the Headmaster.</p>
<p><i>How much does he know...?</i></p>
<p>The Headmaster had seen Harry in the grip of his mysterious dark
side, as deep as Harry had ever sunk into it. Harry still
remembered what it had been like to watch, invisibly Time-Turned,
as his past self faced down the older Slytherins; the boy with the
scar on his forehead who didn't act like the others. <i>Of
course</i> the Headmaster would have noticed something odd about
the boy in his office...</p>
<p>And Dumbledore had concluded that his pet hero had cunning to
match his destined foe, the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Which wasn't asking for very much, considering that the Dark
Lord had put a clearly visible Dark Mark on all of his servants'
left arms, and that he'd slaughtered the entire monastery that
taught the martial art he'd wanted to learn.</p>
<p>Enough cunning to match <i>Professor Quirrell</i> would be a
<i>whole</i> different order of problem.</p>
<p>But it was also clear that the Headmaster wouldn't be satisfied
until Harry went all cold and darkish, and came up with some sort
of answer that sounded impressively cunning... which had better not
<i>actually</i> get in the way of Professor Quirrell's teaching
Defense...</p>
<p>And of course Harry <i>would</i> go over to his dark side and
think it through from that direction, just to be honest, and just
in case.</p>
<p>"Tell me," Harry said, "everything about how the Dementor is to
be brought in, and how it is to be guarded."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyebrows rose for a moment, and then the old wizard
began to speak.</p>
<p>The Dementor would be transported to the grounds of Hogwarts by
an Auror trio, all three personally known to the Headmaster, and
all three able to cast a corporeal Patronus Charm. They would be
met at the edge of the grounds by Dumbledore, who would pass the
Dementor through the Hogwarts wards -</p>
<p>Harry asked if the pass was permanent or temporary - whether
someone could just bring in the same Dementor again the next
day.</p>
<p>The pass was temporary (replied the Headmaster with an approving
nod), and the explanation went on: The Dementor would be in a cage
of solid titanium bars, not Transfigured but true-forged; in time a
Dementor's presence would corrode that metal to dust, but not in a
single day.</p>
<p>Students awaiting their turn would stay well back of the
Dementor, behind two corporeal Patronuses maintained by two of the
three Aurors at any given time. Dumbledore would wait by the
Dementor's cage with his Patronus. A single student would approach
the Dementor; and Dumbledore would dispel his Patronus; and the
student would attempt to cast their own Patronus Charm; and if they
failed, Dumbledore would restore his Patronus before the student
could suffer any permanent damage. Past dueling champion Professor
Flitwick would also be present while there were students near, just
to add safety margin.</p>
<p>"Why just <i>you</i> waiting by the Dementor?" said Harry. "I
mean, shouldn't it be you plus an Auror -"</p>
<p>The Headmaster shook his head. "They could not withstand the
repeated exposure to the Dementor, each time I dispel my
Patronus."</p>
<p>And if Dumbledore's Patronus did fail for some reason, while one
of the students was still near the Dementor, the third Auror would
cast another corporeal Patronus and send it to shield the
student...</p>
<p>Harry poked and prodded, but he couldn't see a flaw in the
security.</p>
<p>So Harry took a deep breath, sank further into the chair, closed
his eyes, and remembered:</p>
<p><i>"And that will be... five points? No, let us make it an even
ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat."</i></p>
<p>The cold came more slowly now, more reluctantly, Harry hadn't
been calling much on his dark side lately...</p>
<p>Harry had to run through that entire session in Potions in his
mind, before his blood chilled into something approaching deadly
crystalline clarity.</p>
<p>And then he thought of the Dementor.</p>
<p>And it was obvious.</p>
<p>"The Dementor is a distraction," Harry said. The coldness clear
in his voice, since that was what Dumbledore wanted and expected.
"A large, salient threat, but in the end straightforward, and easy
to defend against. So while all your attention is focused on the
Dementor, the real plot will be happening elsewhere."</p>
<p>Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment, and then gave a slow
nod. "Yes..." said the Headmaster. "And I do believe I know what it
might be a distraction <i>from</i>, if Professor Quirrell means
ill... thank you, Harry."</p>
<p>The Headmaster was still staring at Harry, a strange look in
those ancient eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Harry with a tinge of annoyance, the cold
still lingering in his blood.</p>
<p>"I have another question for that young man," said the
Headmaster. "It is something I have long wondered to myself, yet
been unable to comprehend. <i>Why?</i>" There was a tinge of pain
in his voice. "Why would anyone deliberately make himself a
monster? Why do evil for the sake of evil? Why Voldemort?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Whirr, bzzzt, tick; ding, puff, splat...</i></p>
<p>Harry stared at the Headmaster in surprise.</p>
<p>"How would <i>I</i> know?" said Harry. "Am I supposed to
magically understand the Dark Lord because I'm the hero, or
something?"</p>
<p>"<i>Yes!</i>" said Dumbledore. "My own great foe was
Grindelwald, and <i>him</i> I understood very well indeed.
Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have
been, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was a good
person, and therefore always in the right. <i>For the greater
good</i>, that was his slogan; and he truly believed it himself,
even as he tore at all Europe like a wounded animal. And him, I
defeated in the end. But then after him came Voldemort, to destroy
everything I had protected in Britain." The hurt was plain now in
Dumbledore's voice, exposed upon his face. "He committed acts worse
by far than Grindelwald's worst, horror for the sake of horror. I
sacrificed everything only to hold him back, and I still don't
understand <i>why!</i> <i>Why</i>, Harry? Why did he do it? He was
never my destined foe, but yours, so if you have any guesses at
all, Harry, please tell me! <i>Why?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry stared down at his hands. The truth was that Harry hadn't
read up on the Dark Lord yet, and right now he hadn't the tiniest
clue. And somehow that didn't seem like an answer the Headmaster
wanted to hear. "Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In the beginning he
thought he'd do just one, but it sacrificed part of his good side,
and that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark rituals, so
he did more and more rituals in a positive feedback cycle until he
ended up as a tremendously powerful monster -"</p>
<p>"No!" Now the Headmaster's voice was agonized. "I can't believe
that, Harry! There has to be something more to it than just
that!"</p>
<p><i>Why should there be?</i> thought Harry, but he didn't say it,
because it was clear that the Headmaster thought the universe was a
story and had a plot, and that huge tragedies weren't allowed to
happen except for equally huge, significant reasons. "I'm sorry,
Headmaster. The Dark Lord doesn't seem like much of a dark mirror
to me, not at all. There isn't anything I find even the
<i>tiniest</i> bit tempting about nailing the skins of Yermy
Wibble's family to a newsroom wall."</p>
<p>"Have you <i>no</i> wisdom to share?" said Dumbledore. There was
pleading in the old wizard's voice, almost begging.</p>
<p><i>Evil happens,</i> thought Harry, <i>it doesn't mean anything
or teach us anything, except to not be evil? The Dark Lord was
probably just a selfish bastard who didn't care who he hurt, or an
idiot who made stupidly avoidable mistakes that snowballed. There
is no destiny behind the ills of this world; if Hitler had been
allowed into architecture school like he wanted, the whole history
of Europe would have been different; if we lived in the sort of
universe where horrible things were only allowed to happen for good
reasons, they just wouldn't happen in the first place.</i></p>
<p>And none of that, obviously, was what the Headmaster wanted to
hear.</p>
<p>The old wizard was still looking at Harry from over a fiddly
thing like a frozen puff of smoke, a painful desperation in those
ancient, waiting eyes.</p>
<p>Well, sounding wise wasn't difficult. It was a lot easier than
being intelligent, actually, since you didn't have to say anything
surprising or come up with any new insights. You just let your
brain's pattern-matching software complete the cliche, using
whatever Deep Wisdom you'd stored previously.</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said solemnly, "I would rather not define
myself by my enemies."</p>
<p>Somehow, even in the midst of all the whirring and ticking,
there was a kind of silence.</p>
<p>That had come out a bit more Deeply Wise than Harry had
intended.</p>
<p>"You may be very wise, Harry..." the Headmaster said slowly. "I
do wish... that I could have been defined by my friends." The pain
in his voice had grown deeper.</p>
<p>Harry's mind searched hastily for something else Deeply Wise to
say that would soften the unintended force of the blow -</p>
<p>"Or perhaps," Harry said more softly, "it is the foe that makes
the Gryffindor, as it is the friend that makes the Hufflepuff, and
the ambition that makes the Slytherin. I do know that it is always,
in every generation, the puzzle that makes the scientist."</p>
<p>"It is a dreadful fate to which you condemn my House, Harry,"
said the Headmaster. The pain was still in his voice. "For now that
you remark on it, I do think that I was very much made by my
enemies."</p>
<p>Harry stared at his own hands, where they lay in his lap. Maybe
he should just shut up while he was ahead.</p>
<p>"But you <i>have</i> answered my question," said Dumbledore more
softly, as though to himself. "I should have realized that would be
a Slytherin's key. For his ambition, all for the sake of his
ambition; and <i>that</i> I know, though not <i>why</i>..." For a
time Dumbledore stared off into nothingness; then he straightened,
and his eyes seemed to focus on Harry again.</p>
<p>"And you, Harry," said the Headmaster, "you name yourself a
<i>scientist?</i>" His voice was laced with surprise and mild
disapproval.</p>
<p>"You don't like science?" said Harry a little wearily. He'd
hoped Dumbledore would be fonder of Muggle things.</p>
<p>"I suppose it is useful to those without wands," said
Dumbledore, frowning. "But it seems a strange thing by which to
define yourself. Is science as important as love? As kindness? As
friendship? Is it science that makes you fond of Minerva
McGonagall? Is it science that makes you care for Hermione Granger?
Will it be science to which you turn, when you try to kindle warmth
in Draco Malfoy's heart?"</p>
<p><i>You know, the sad thing is, you probably think you just
uttered some kind of incredibly wise knockdown argument.</i></p>
<p>Now, how to phrase the rejoinder in such fashion that it also
sounded incredibly wise...</p>
<p>"You are not Ravenclaw," Harry said with calm dignity, "and so
it might not have occurred to you that to respect the truth, and
seek it all the days of your life, could also be an act of
grace."</p>
<p>The Headmaster's eyebrows rose up. And then he sighed. "How did
you become so wise, so young...?" The old wizard sounded sad, as he
said it. "Perhaps it will prove valuable to you."</p>
<p><i>Only for impressing ancient wizards who are overly impressed
with themselves,</i> thought Harry. He was actually a bit
disappointed by Dumbledore's credulity; it wasn't that Harry had
<i>lied</i>, but Dumbledore seemed far too impressed with Harry's
ability to phrase things so that they sounded profound, instead of
putting them into plain English like Richard Feynman had done with
<i>his</i> wisdom...</p>
<p>"Love is more important than wisdom," said Harry, just to test
the limits of Dumbledore's tolerance for blindingly obvious cliches
completed by sheer pattern matching without any sort of detailed
analysis.</p>
<p>The Headmaster nodded gravely, and said, "Indeed."</p>
<p>Harry stood up out of the chair, and stretched his arms.
<i>Well, I'd better go off and love something, then, that's bound
to help me defeat the Dark Lord. And next time you ask me for
advice, I'll just give you a hug -</i></p>
<p>"This day you have helped me much, Harry," said the Headmaster.
"And so there is one last thing I would ask that young man."</p>
<p><i>Great.</i></p>
<p>"Tell me, Harry," said the Headmaster (and now his voice sounded
simply puzzled, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes),
"why do Dark Wizards fear death so greatly?"</p>
<p>"Er," said Harry, "sorry, I've got to back the Dark Wizards on
that one."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble -</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Death is bad," said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of
clear communication. "Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of
death is like being scared of a great big monster with poisonous
fangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in
fact, indicate that you have a psychological problem."</p>
<p>The Headmaster was staring at him as though he'd just turned
into a cat.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Harry, "let me put it this way. Do you <i>want</i>
to die? Because if so, there's this Muggle thing called a suicide
prevention hotline -"</p>
<p>"When it is time," the old wizard said quietly. "Not before. I
would never seek to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it
comes."</p>
<p>Harry was frowning sternly. "That doesn't sound like you have a
very strong will to live, Headmaster!"</p>
<p>"Harry..." The old wizard's voice was starting to sound a little
helpless; and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard,
unnoticed, had drifted into a crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and
was slowly taking on a greenish tinge that crept up the hairs. "I
think I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are not eager
to live. They <i>fear death.</i> They do not reach up toward the
sun's light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker
caverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life
they desire, but <i>immortality;</i> and they are so driven to
grasp at it that they will sacrifice their very souls! Do you want
to live <i>forever</i>, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and so do you," said Harry. "I want to live one more day.
Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want
to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If
you don't want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you
don't want to live forever, it means you want to die. You've got to
do one or the other... I'm not getting through here, am I."</p>
<p>The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of
incommensurability.</p>
<p>"I have lived a hundred and ten years," the old wizard said
quietly (taking his beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake
out the color). "I have seen and done a great many things, too many
of which I wish I had never seen or done. And yet I do not regret
being alive, for watching my students grow is a joy that has not
begun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that it
does! What would you <i>do</i> with eternity, Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. "Meet all the interesting people in
the world, read all the good books and then write something even
better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the
Moon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth
birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and
final rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find
out why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars,
discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a
party on the other side of the Milky Way once we've explored the
whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth
to watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry about finding
a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but
I'm a lot more hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws
of physics are just optional guidelines."</p>
<p>"I did not understand much of that," said Dumbledore. "But I
must ask if these are things that you truly desire so desperately,
or if you only imagine them so as to imagine not being tired, as
you run and run from death."</p>
<p>"Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before
you're allowed to die," Harry said firmly. "It's life, you just go
on living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've
found something better."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they
touched it, the numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and
the hands briefly appeared in different positions. "In the unlikely
event that I am permitted to tarry until a hundred and fifty," said
the old wizard, "I do not think I would mind. But two hundred years
would be entirely too much of a good thing."</p>
<p>"Yes, well," Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of
his Mum and Dad and <i>their</i> allotted span if Harry didn't do
something about it, "I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a
culture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years,
that dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature
as dying at, say, <i>eighty</i>." Harry's voice went hard, on that
last word.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the old wizard said peacefully. "I would not wish to
die before my friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The
hardest time is when those you loved the most have gone on before
you, and yet others still live, for whose sake you must stay..."
Dumbledore's eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing sad. "Do not
mourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with
those I have long missed, on our next great adventure."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Harry said in sudden realization. "You believe in an
<i>afterlife</i>. I got the impression wizards didn't have
religion?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Toot. Beep. Thud.</p>
<p>"<i>How can you not believe it?</i>" said the Headmaster,
looking completely flabbergasted. "<i>Harry, you're a wizard!
You've seen ghosts!</i>"</p>
<p>"Ghosts," Harry said, his voice flat. "You mean those things
like portraits, stored memories and behaviors with no awareness or
life, accidentally impressed into the surrounding material by the
burst of magic that accompanies the violent death of a wizard
-"</p>
<p>"I've heard that theory," said the Headmaster, his voice growing
sharp, "repeated by wizards who mistake cynicism for wisdom, who
think that to look down upon others is to elevate themselves. It is
one of the silliest ideas I have heard in a hundred and ten years!
<i>Yes,</i> ghosts do not learn or grow, because this is <i>not
where they belong!</i> Souls are meant to move on, there is no life
remaining for them <i>here!</i> And if not ghosts, then what of the
Veil? What of the Resurrection Stone?"</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm, "I'll
hear out your evidence, because <i>that's what a scientist
does.</i> But first, Headmaster, let me tell you a little story."
Harry's voice was trembling. "You know, when I got here, when I got
off the train from King's Cross, I don't mean yesterday but back in
September, when I got off the train then, Headmaster, I'd never
seen a ghost. I wasn't <i>expecting</i> ghosts. So when I saw them,
Headmaster, I did something really dumb. I <i>jumped to
conclusions.</i> I, I thought there <i>was</i> an afterlife, I
thought no one had ever really died, I thought that everyone the
human species had ever lost was really fine after all, I thought
that wizards could talk to people who'd passed on, that it just
took the right spell to summon them, that wizards could <i>do</i>
that, I thought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell
them that I'd heard about their sacrifice and that I'd begun to
call them my mother and father -"</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered in the old
wizard's eyes. He took a step closer across the office -</p>
<p>"And <i>then,</i>" spat Harry, the fury coming fully into his
voice, the cold rage at the universe for being like that and at
himself for being so stupid, "I asked Hermione and she said that
they were just <i>afterimages,</i> burned into the stone of the
castle by the death of a wizard, like the silhouettes left on the
walls of Hiroshima. And I should have known! I should have known
without even having to ask! I shouldn't have believed it even for
all of thirty seconds! Because if people had souls there wouldn't
be any such thing as brain damage, if your soul could go on
speaking after your whole brain was gone, how could damage to the
left cerebral hemisphere take away your ability to talk? And
Professor McGonagall, when she told me about how my parents had
died, she didn't act like they'd just gone away on a long trip to
another country, like they'd emigrated to Australia back in the
days of sailing ships, which is the way people would act if they
<i>actually knew</i> that death was just going somewhere else, if
they had hard evidence for an afterlife, instead of making stuff up
to console themselves, it would change <i>everything,</i> it
wouldn't <i>matter</i> that everyone had lost someone in the war,
it would be a little sad but not <i>horrible!</i> And I'd already
seen that people in the wizarding world didn't act like that! So I
should have known better! And that was when I knew that my parents
were really dead and gone forever and ever, that there wasn't
anything left of them, that I'd never get a chance to meet them
and, and, and the other children thought I was crying because I was
<i>scared of ghosts -</i>"</p>
<p>The old wizard's face was horrified, he opened his mouth to
speak -</p>
<p>"So tell me, Headmaster! Tell me about the evidence! But
<i>don't you dare</i> exaggerate a single tiny bit of it, because
if you give me false hope again, and I find out later that you lied
or stretched things just a little, I won't ever forgive you for it!
<i>What's the Veil?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry reached up and wiped at his cheeks, while the glass things
of the office stopped vibrating from his last shriek.</p>
<p>"The Veil," said the old wizard with only a slight tremble in
his voice, "is a great stone archway, kept in the Department of
Mysteries; a gateway to the land of the dead."</p>
<p>"And how does anyone know that?" said Harry. "Don't tell me what
you believe, tell me what you've <i>seen!</i>"</p>
<p>The physical manifestation of the barrier between worlds was a
great stone archway, old and tall and coming to a sharp point, with
a tattered black veil like the surface of a pool of water,
stretched between the stones; rippling, always, from the constant
and one-way passage of the souls. If you stood by the Veil you
could hear the voices of the dead calling, always calling in
whispers barely on the wrong side of comprehension, growing louder
and more numerous if you stayed and tried to hear, as they tried to
communicate; and if you listened too long, you would go to meet
them, and in the moment you touched the Veil you would be sucked
through, and never be heard from again.</p>
<p>"That doesn't even sound like an <i>interesting</i> fraud,"
Harry said, his voice calmer now that there was nothing there to
make him hope, or make him angry for having hopes dashed. "Someone
built a stone archway, made a little black rippling surface between
it that Vanished anything it touched, and enchanted it to whisper
to people and hypnotize them."</p>
<p>"Harry..." the Headmaster said, starting to look rather worried.
"I can tell you the truth, but if you refuse to hear it..."</p>
<p><i>Also not interesting.</i> "What's the Resurrection
Stone?"</p>
<p>"I would not tell you," the Headmaster said slowly, "save that I
fear what this disbelief may do to you... so listen, then, Harry,
please listen..."</p>
<p>The Resurrection Stone was one of the three legendary Deathly
Hallows, kin to Harry's cloak. The Resurrection Stone could call
souls back from the dead - bring them back into the world of the
living, though not as they were. Cadmus Peverell used the stone to
call back his lost beloved from the dead, but her heart stayed with
the dead, and not in the world of the living. And in time it drove
him mad, and he killed himself to be truly with her once
more...</p>
<p>In all politeness, Harry raised his hand.</p>
<p>"Yes?" the Headmaster said reluctantly.</p>
<p>"The obvious test to see if the Resurrection Stone is
<i>really</i> calling back the dead, or just projecting an image
from the user's mind, is to ask a question whose answer <i>you</i>
don't know, but the dead person <i>would</i>, and that can be
definitely verified in this world. For example, call back -"</p>
<p>Then Harry paused, because <i>this</i> time he'd managed to
think it through one step ahead of his tongue, fast enough to
<i>not</i> say the first name and test that had sprung to mind.</p>
<p>"...your dead wife, and ask her where she left her lost earring,
or something like that," Harry finished. "Did anyone do any tests
like that?"</p>
<p>"The Resurrection Stone has been lost for centuries, Harry," the
Headmaster said quietly.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Well, I'm a scientist, and I'm always willing
to be convinced. If you <i>really</i> believe the Resurrection
Stone calls back the dead - then you must believe a test like that
will succeed, right? So do you know anything about where to find
the Resurrection Stone? I got <i>one</i> Deathly Hallow already
under highly mysterious circumstances, and, well, we both know how
the rhythm of the world works on that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Dumbledore stared at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry gazed equably back at the Headmaster.</p>
<p>The old wizard passed a hand across his forehead and muttered,
"This is madness."</p>
<p>(Somehow, Harry managed to stop himself from laughing.)</p>
<p>And Dumbledore told Harry to draw forth the Cloak of
Invisibility from his pouch; at the Headmaster's direction, Harry
stared at the inside and back of the hood until he saw it, faintly
drawn against the silvery mesh in faded scarlet like dried blood,
the symbol of the Deathly Hallows: a triangle, with a circle drawn
inside, and a line dividing them both.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said politely. "I shall be sure to keep an
eye out for a stone so marked. Do you have any other evidence?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself.
"Harry," the old wizard said, his voice rising, "this is a
dangerous road you are walking, I am not sure I do the right thing
by saying this, but I <i>must</i> wrench you from this way! Harry,
<i>how could Voldemort have survived the death of his body if he
did not have a soul?</i>"</p>
<p>And <i>that</i> was when Harry realized that there was exactly
one person who'd <i>originally</i> told Professor McGonagall that
the Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the
crazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school, who thought the
world ran on cliches.</p>
<p>"Good question," Harry said, after some internal debate about
how to proceed. "Maybe he found some way of duplicating the power
of the Resurrection Stone, only he loaded it in advance with a
<i>complete</i> copy of his brain state. Or something like that."
Harry was suddenly far from sure that he was trying to come up with
an explanation for something that had <i>actually happened</i>.
"Actually, can you just go ahead and tell me everything you know
about how the Dark Lord survived and what it might take to kill
him?" <i>If he even still exists as more than Quibbler
headlines.</i></p>
<p>"You are not fooling me, Harry," said the old wizard; his face
looked ancient now, and lined by more than years. "I know why you
are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do
not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of
the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!"</p>
<p>"Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in
order to use it for <i>everyone!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Tick, crackle, fzzzt...</p>
<p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore just stood there and
stared at Harry with his mouth gaping open dumbly.</p>
<p>(Harry awarded himself a tally mark for Monday, since he'd
managed to blow someone's mind completely before the day was
over.)</p>
<p>"And in case it wasn't clear," said Harry, "by <i>everyone</i> I
mean all Muggles too, not just all wizards."</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard, shaking his head. His voice rose.
"No, no, no! <i>This is insanity!</i>"</p>
<p>"Bwa ha ha!" said Harry.</p>
<p>The old wizard's face was tight with anger and worry. "Voldemort
stole the book from which he gleaned his secret; it was not there
when I went to look for it. But this much I know, and this much I
will tell you: his immortality was born of a ritual terrible and
Dark, blacker than pitchest black! And it was Myrtle, poor sweet
Myrtle, who died for it; his immortality took sacrifice, it took
<i>murder -</i>"</p>
<p>"Well <i>obviously</i> I'm not going to popularize a method of
immortality that requires killing people! That would defeat the
<i>entire point!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a startled pause.</p>
<p>Slowly the old wizard's face relaxed out of its anger, though
the worry was still there. "You would use no ritual requiring human
sacrifice."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you take me for, <i>Headmaster,</i>" Harry
said coldly, his own anger rising, "but let's not forget that
<i>I'm</i> the one who wants people to <i>live!</i> The one who
wants to <i>save</i> everyone! <i>You're</i> the one who thinks
death is awesome and everyone ought to die!"</p>
<p>"I am at a loss, Harry," said the old wizard. His feet once more
began trudging across his strange office. "I know not what to say."
He picked up a crystal ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames,
looked into it with a sad expression. "Only that I am greatly
misunderstood by you... I don't <i>want</i> everyone to die,
Harry!"</p>
<p>"You just don't want anyone to be immortal," Harry said with
considerable irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies
like <i>All x: Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x)</i> were beyond the
reasoning abilities of the world's most powerful wizard.</p>
<p>The old wizard nodded. "I am less afraid than I was, but still
greatly worried for you, Harry," he said quietly. His hand, a
little wizened by time, but still strong, placed the crystal ball
firmly back into its stand. "For the fear of death is a bitter
thing, an illness of the soul by which people are twisted and
warped. Voldemort is not the only Dark Wizard to go down that bleak
road, though I fear he has taken it further than any before
him."</p>
<p>"And you think <i>you're</i> not afraid of death?" Harry said,
not even trying to mask the incredulity in his voice.</p>
<p>The old wizard's face was peaceful. "I am not perfect, Harry,
but I think I have accepted my death as part of myself."</p>
<p>"Uh huh," Harry said. "See, there's this little thing called
<i>cognitive dissonance,</i> or in plainer English, <i>sour
grapes.</i> If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a
month, and no one could do anything about it, pretty soon there'd
be all sorts of philosophers, <i>pretending to be wise</i> as you
put it, who found all sorts of <i>amazing benefits</i> to being hit
on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you
tougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you're <i>not</i>
getting hit with a truncheon. But if you went up to someone who
<i>wasn't</i> getting hit, and you asked them if they wanted to
<i>start</i>, in exchange for those <i>amazing benefits,</i> they'd
say no. And if you <i>didn't</i> have to die, if you came from
somewhere that no one had ever even <i>heard</i> of death, and I
suggested to you that it would be an <i>amazing wonderful great
idea</i> for people to get wrinkled and old and eventually cease to
exist, why, you'd have me hauled right off to a lunatic asylum! So
why would anyone possibly think any thought so silly as that death
is a <i>good</i> thing? Because you're afraid of it, because you
don't <i>really</i> want to die, and that thought hurts so much
inside you that you have to rationalize it away, do something to
numb the pain, so you won't have to think about it -"</p>
<p>"No, Harry," the old wizard said. His face was gentle, his hand
trailed through a lighted pool of water that made small musical
chimes as his fingers stirred it. "Though I can understand how you
must think so."</p>
<p>"Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?" Harry said, his
voice now hard and grim. "Then look within the part of yourself
that flees not from death but from the <i>fear</i> of death, that
finds that fear so unbearable that it will embrace Death as a
friend and cozen up to it, try to become one with the night so that
it can think itself master of the abyss. You have taken the most
terrible of all evils and called it good! With only a slight twist
that same part of yourself would murder innocents, and call it
friendship. If you can call death better than life then you can
twist your moral compass to point <i>anywhere -</i>"</p>
<p>"I think," said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets from his hand
to the sound of tiny tinkling bells, "that you understand Dark
Wizards <i>very</i> well, without yet being one yourself." It was
said in perfect seriousness, and without accusation. "But your
comprehension of <i>me</i>, I fear, is sorely lacking." The old
wizard was smiling now, and there was a gentle laughter in his
voice.</p>
<p>Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from
somewhere there was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of
resentment, at Dumbledore's condescension, and all the laughter
that wise old fools had ever used in place of argument. "Funny
thing, you know, I thought Draco Malfoy was going to be this
impossible to talk to, and instead, in his childish innocence, he
was a hundred times stronger than you."</p>
<p>A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard's face. "What do you
mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean," Harry said, his voice biting, "that Draco actually
<i>took his own beliefs seriously</i> and <i>processed</i> my words
instead of <i>throwing them out the window</i> by smiling with
gentle superiority. You're so old and wise, you can't even
<i>notice</i> anything I'm saying! Not understand,
<i>notice!</i>"</p>
<p>"I <i>have</i> listened to you, Harry," said Dumbledore, looking
more solemn now, "but to listen is not always to agree.
Disagreements aside, what is it that you think I do not
comprehend?"</p>
<p><i>That if you</i> really <i>believed in an afterlife, you'd go
down to St. Mungo's and kill Neville's parents, Alice and Frank
Longbottom, so they could go on to their</i> next great
adventure<i>, instead of letting them linger here in their damaged
state -</i></p>
<p>Harry barely, <i>barely</i> kept himself from saying it out
loud.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said coldly. "I'll answer your original
question, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death.
Pretend, Headmaster, that you <i>really</i> believed in souls.
Pretend that anyone could verify the existence of souls at any
time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they
<i>knew</i> their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imagine
<i>destroying</i> a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing
remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine what a
terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever been
committed in the history of the universe, which you would do
anything to prevent from happening even once? Because <i>that's</i>
what Death really is - the annihilation of a soul!"</p>
<p>The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. "I
suppose I <i>do</i> understand now," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Harry. "Understand what?"</p>
<p>"Voldemort," said the old wizard. "I understand him now at last.
Because to believe that the world is truly like that, you must
believe there is no justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at
its core. I asked you why he became a monster, and you could give
no reason. And if I could ask <i>him</i>, I suppose, his answer
would be: Why not?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>They stood there gazing into each other's eyes, the old wizard
in his robes, and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his
forehead.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Harry," said the old wizard, "will <i>you</i> become a
monster?"</p>
<p>"No," said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.</p>
<p>"Why not?" said the old wizard.</p>
<p>The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and
proud, and said: "There is no justice in the laws of Nature,
Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The
universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The
stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to!
<i>We</i> care! There <i>is</i> light in the world, and it is
<i>us!</i>"</p>
<p>"I wonder what will become of you, Harry," said the old wizard.
His voice was soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. "It is
enough to make me wish to live just to see it."</p>
<p>The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the
oaken door slammed shut behind him with a thud.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="40">Chapter 40</h2><h3>Pretending to be Wise, Pt
2</h3>
<p>Harry, holding the tea cup in the exactly correct way that
Professor Quirrell had needed to demonstrate three times, took a
small, careful sip. All the way across the long, wide table that
was the centerpiece of Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell took a sip
from his own cup, making it look far more natural and elegant. The
tea itself was something whose name Harry couldn't even pronounce,
or at least, every time Harry had tried to repeat the Chinese
words, Professor Quirrell had corrected him, until finally Harry
had given up.</p>
<p>Harry had maneuvered himself into getting a glimpse at the bill
last time, and Professor Quirrell had let him get away with it.</p>
<p>He'd felt an impulse to drink a Comed-Tea first.</p>
<p><i>Even taking that into account</i>, Harry had still been
shocked out of his skin.</p>
<p>And it still tasted to him like, well, tea.</p>
<p>There was a quiet, nagging suspicion in Harry's mind that
Professor Quirrell <i>knew</i> this, and was deliberately buying
ridiculously expensive tea that Harry couldn't appreciate <i>just
to mess with him.</i> Professor Quirrell <i>himself</i> might not
like it all that much. Maybe <i>nobody</i> actually liked this tea,
and the only point of it was to be ridiculously expensive and make
the victim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe it was really just
ordinary tea, only you asked for it in a certain code, and they put
a fake gigantic price on the bill...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's expression was drawn and thoughtful. "No,"
Professor Quirrell said, "you should <i>not</i> have told the
Headmaster about your conversation with Lord Malfoy. Please try to
think faster next time, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Professor Quirrell," Harry said meekly. "I still
don't see it." There were times when Harry felt very much like an
impostor, pretending to be cunning in Professor Quirrell's
presence.</p>
<p>"Lord Malfoy is Albus Dumbledore's opponent," said Professor
Quirrell. "At least for this present time. All Britain is their
chessboard, all wizards their pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy
threatened to throw away everything, abandon his game, to take
vengeance on you if Mr. Malfoy was hurt. In which case, Mr.
Potter...?"</p>
<p>It took more long seconds for Harry to get it, but it was clear
that Professor Quirrell wasn't going to give any more hints, not
that Harry wanted them.</p>
<p>Then Harry's mind finally made the connection, and he frowned.
"Dumbledore kills Draco, makes it look like <i>I</i> did it, and
Lucius sacrifices his game against Dumbledore to get at me? That...
doesn't seem like the Headmaster's <i>style,</i> Professor
Quirrell..." Harry's mind flashed back to a similar warning from
Draco, which had made Harry say the same thing.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell shrugged, and sipped his tea.</p>
<p>Harry sipped his own tea, and sat in silence. The tablecloth
spread over the table was in a very peaceful pattern, seeming at
first like plain cloth, but if you stared at it long enough, or
kept silent long enough, you started to see a faint tracery of
flowers glimmering on it; the curtains of the room had changed
their pattern to match, and seemed to shimmer as though in a silent
breeze. Professor Quirrell was in a contemplative mood that
Saturday, and so was Harry, and Mary's Room, it seemed, had not
neglected to notice this.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said suddenly, "is there an
afterlife?"</p>
<p>Harry had chosen the question carefully. Not, <i>do you believe
in an afterlife?</i> but simply <i>Is there an afterlife?</i> What
people <i>really</i> believed didn't seem to them like
<i>beliefs</i> at all. People didn't say, 'I strongly believe in
the sky being blue!' They just said, 'the sky is blue'. Your true
inner map of the world just felt to you like the way the world
<i>was...</i></p>
<p>The Defense Professor raised his cup to his lips again before
answering. His face was thoughtful. "If there is, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell, "then quite a few wizards have wasted a great
deal of effort in their searches for immortality."</p>
<p>"That's not actually an answer," Harry observed. He'd learned by
now to notice that sort of thing when talking to Professor
Quirrell.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell set down his teacup with a small,
high-pitched tacking sound on his saucer. "Some of those wizards
were reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter, so you may take it that
the existence of an afterlife is not obvious. I have looked into
the matter myself. There have been many claims of the sort which
hope and fear would be expected to produce. Among those reports
whose veracity is not in doubt, there is nothing which could not be
the result of mere wizardry. There are certain devices said to
communicate with the dead, but these, I suspect, only project an
image from the mind; the result seems indistinguishable from memory
because it <i>is</i> memory. The alleged spirits tell no secrets
they knew in life, nor could have learned after death, which are
not known to the wielder -"</p>
<p>"Which is why the Resurrection Stone is not the most valuable
magical artifact in the world," said Harry.</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Professor Quirrell, "though I wouldn't say no
to a chance to try it." There was a dry, thin smile on his lips;
and something colder, more distant, in his eyes. "You spoke to
Dumbledore of that as well, I take it."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The curtains were taking on a faintly blue pattern, and a dim
tracery of elaborate snowflakes now seemed to be becoming visible
on the tablecloth. Professor Quirrell's voice sounded very calm.
"The Headmaster can be very persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope he has
not persuaded you."</p>
<p>"<i>Heck</i> no," said Harry. "Didn't fool me for a second."</p>
<p>"I should hope not," said Professor Quirrell, still in that very
calm tone. "I would be extremely put out to discover that the
Headmaster had convinced you to throw away your life on some fool
plot by telling you that death is the next great adventure."</p>
<p>"I don't think the Headmaster believed it himself, actually,"
Harry said. He sipped his own tea again. "He asked me what I could
possibly do with eternity, gave me the usual line about it being
boring, and he didn't seem to see any conflict between that and his
own claim to have an immortal soul. In fact, he gave me a whole
long lecture about how awful it was to want immortality before he
claimed to have an immortal soul. I can't quite visualize what must
have been going on inside his head, but I don't think he
<i>actually</i> had a mental model of himself continuing forever in
the afterlife..."</p>
<p>The temperature of the room seemed to be dropping.</p>
<p>"You perceive," said a voice like ice from the other end of the
table, "that Dumbledore does not truly believe as he speaks. It is
not that he has compromised his principles. It is that he never had
them from the beginning. Are you becoming cynical yet, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry had dropped his eyes to his teacup. "A little," Harry said
to his possibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive
Chinese tea. "I'm certainly becoming a bit <i>frustrated</i>
with... whatever's going wrong in people's heads."</p>
<p>"Yes," said that icy voice. "I find it frustrating as well."</p>
<p>"Is there any way to get people <i>not</i> to do that?" said
Harry to his teacup.</p>
<p>"There is indeed a certain useful spell which solves the
problem."</p>
<p>Harry looked up hopefully at that, and saw a cold, cold smile on
the Defense Professor's face.</p>
<p>Then Harry got it. "I mean, <i>besides</i> Avada Kedavra."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn't.</p>
<p>"Anyway," Harry said hastily, "I <i>did</i> think fast enough
not to suggest the obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in
front of Dumbledore. Have you ever seen a stone with a line, inside
a circle, inside a triangle?"</p>
<p>The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the
ordinary Professor Quirrell returned. "Not that I can recall,"
Professor Quirrell said after a while, a thoughtful frown on his
face. "That is the Resurrection Stone?"</p>
<p>Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol
he had seen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take
out his own wand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating
obligingly across the table toward Professor Quirrell. Harry really
wanted to learn that wandless stuff, but that, apparently, was far
above his current curriculum.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell studied Harry's tea-saucer for a moment, then
shook his head; and a moment later, the saucer went floating back
to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry put his teacup back on the saucer, noting absently as he
did so that the symbol he'd drawn had vanished. "If you happen to
see a stone with that symbol," said Harry, "and it <i>does</i> talk
to the afterlife, do let me know. I have a few questions for Merlin
or anyone who was around in Atlantis."</p>
<p>"Quite," said Professor Quirrell. Then the Defense Professor
lifted up his teacup again, and tipped it back as though to finish
the last of what was there. "By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we
shall have to cut short today's visit to Diagon Alley. I was hoping
it would - but never mind. Let it stand that there is something
else I must do this afternoon."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and finished his own tea, then rose from his seat
at the same time as Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"One last question," Harry said, as Professor Quirrell's coat
lifted itself off the coatrack and went floating toward the Defense
Professor. "Magic is loose in the world, and I no longer trust my
guesses so much as I once did. So in your own best guess and
without any wishful thinking, do <i>you</i> believe there's an
afterlife?"</p>
<p>"If I did, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell as he shrugged
on his coat, "would I still be <i>here?</i>"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="41">Chapter 41</h2><h3>Frontal Override</h3>
<p>The biting January wind howled around the vast, blank stone
walls that demarcated the material bounds of the castle Hogwarts,
whispering and whistling in odd pitches as it blew past closed
windows and stone turrets. The most recent snow had mostly blown
away, but occasional patches of melted and refrozen ice still stuck
to the stone face and blazed reflected sunlight. From a distance,
it must have looked like Hogwarts was blinking hundreds of
eyes.</p>
<p>A sudden gust made Draco flinch, and try, impossibly, to press
his body even closer to the stone, which felt like ice and smelled
like ice. Some utterly pointless instinct seemed convinced that he
was about to be blown off the outer wall of Hogwarts, and that the
best way to prevent this was to jerk around in helpless reflex and
possibly throw up.</p>
<p>Draco was trying very hard <i>not</i> to think about the six
stories worth of empty air underneath him, and focus, instead, on
how he was going to kill Harry Potter.</p>
<p>"You know, Mr. Malfoy," said the young girl beside him in a
conversational voice, "if a seer had told me that someday I'd be
hanging onto the side of a castle by my fingertips, trying not to
look down or think about how loud Mum'd scream if she saw me, I
wouldn't've had <i>any</i> idea of how it'd happen, <i>except</i>
that it'd be Harry Potter's fault."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Earlier:</i></p>
<p>The two allied Generals stepped together over Longbottom's body,
their boots hitting the floor in almost perfect synchrony.</p>
<p>Only a single soldier now stood between them and Harry, a
Slytherin boy named Samuel Clamons, whose hand was clenched white
around his wand, held upward to sustain his Prismatic Wall. The
boy's breathing was coming rapidly, but his face showed the same
cold determination that lit the eyes of his general, Harry Potter,
who was standing behind the Prismatic Wall at the dead end of the
corridor next to an open window, with his hands held mysteriously
behind his back.</p>
<p>The battle had been ridiculously difficult, for the enemy being
outnumbered two-to-one. It should have been easy, Dragon Army and
the Sunshine Regiment had melded together easily in practice
sessions, they'd fought each other long enough to know each other
very well indeed. Morale was high, both armies knowing that this
time they weren't just fighting to win for themselves, but fighting
for a world free of traitors. Despite the surprised protests of
both generals, the soldiers of the combined army had insisted on
calling themselves Dramione's Sungon Argiment, and produced patches
for their insignia of a smiling face wreathed in flames.</p>
<p>But Harry's soldiers had all blackened their own insignia - it
didn't look like paint, more like they'd <i>burned</i> that part of
their uniforms - and they'd fought all through the upper levels of
Hogwarts with a desperate fury. The cold rage that Draco sometimes
saw in Harry had seemed to trickle down into his soldiers, and
they'd fought like it hadn't been play. And Harry had emptied out
his entire bag of tricks, there'd been tiny metal balls (Granger
had identified them as "ball bearings") on floors and staircases,
rendering them impassable until cleared, only Harry's army had
already practiced coordinated Hover Charms and they could fly their
own people <i>right over</i> the obstacles they'd made...</p>
<p>You couldn't bring devices into the game from outside, but you
could Transfigure anything you wanted <i>during</i> the game, so
long as it was safe. And that just wasn't fair when you were
fighting a boy raised by scientists, who knew about things like
ball bearings and skateboards and bungee cords.</p>
<p>And so it had come to this.</p>
<p>The survivors of the allied forces had cornered the last
remnants of Harry Potter's army in a dead-end corridor.</p>
<p>Weasley and Vincent had rushed Longbottom at the same time,
moving together like they'd practiced for weeks instead of hours,
and somehow Longbottom had managed to hex them <i>both</i> before
falling himself.</p>
<p>And now it was Draco and Granger and Padma and Samuel and Harry,
and by the looks of Samuel, his Prismatic Wall couldn't last much
longer.</p>
<p>Draco had already leveled his wand at Harry, waiting for the
Prismatic Wall to fall of its own accord; there was no need to
waste a Breaking Drill Hex before then. Padma leveled her own wand
at Samuel, Granger leveled hers at Harry...</p>
<p>Harry was still hiding his hands behind his back, instead of
aiming his wand; and looking at them with a face that could have
been carved out of ice.</p>
<p>It might be a bluff. It probably wasn't.</p>
<p>There was a brief, tense silence.</p>
<p>And then Harry spoke.</p>
<p>"I'm the villain now," the young boy said coldly, "and if you
think villains are this easy to finish off, you'd better think
again. Beat me when I'm fighting seriously, and I'll stay beaten;
but lose, and we'll be doing this all over again next time."</p>
<p>The boy brought his hands forward, and Draco saw that Harry was
wearing strange gloves, with a peculiar grayish material on the
fingertips, and buckles that stapped the gloves tightly to his
wrists.</p>
<p>Beside Draco, the Sunshine General gasped in horror; and Draco,
without even asking why, fired a Breaking Drill Hex.</p>
<p>Samuel staggered, he let out a scream as he staggered, but he
held the Wall; and if Padma or Granger fired now, they would
exhaust their own forces so badly that they might just lose.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" shouted Granger. "<i>You can't be
serious!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry was already in motion.</p>
<p>And as he swung out the open window, his cold voice said,
"Follow if you dare."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The icy wind howled around them.</p>
<p>Draco's arms were already starting to feel tired.</p>
<p>...It had developed that, yesterday, Harry had carefully
demonstrated to Granger exactly how to Transfigure the gloves he
was currently wearing, which used something called 'gecko setae';
and how to glue Transfigured patches of the same material to the
toes of their shoes; and Harry and Granger had, in innocent
childish play, tried climbing around the walls and ceiling a
little.</p>
<p>And that, also yesterday, Harry had supplied Granger with a
grand total of exactly two doses of Feather-Falling Potion to carry
around in her pouch, "just in case".</p>
<p>Not that Padma would have followed them, anyway. <i>She</i>
wasn't crazy.</p>
<p>Draco carefully peeled loose his right hand, stretched it over
as far as he could, and slapped it down on the stone again. Beside
him, Granger did the same.</p>
<p>They'd already swallowed the Feather-Falling Potion. It was
skirting the edges of the game rules, but the potion wouldn't be
activated unless one of them actually fell, and so long as they
<i>didn't</i> fall they weren't using the item.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was watching them.</p>
<p>The two of them were <i>perfectly, completely, utterly
safe.</i></p>
<p>Harry Potter, on the other hand, was going to die.</p>
<p>"I wonder why Harry is doing this," said General Granger in a
reflective tone, as she slowly peeled the fingertips of one hand
off the wall with an extended sticky sound. Her hand plopped back
down again almost as soon as it was lifted. "I'll have to ask him
that after I kill him."</p>
<p>It was amazing how much the two of them were turning out to have
in common.</p>
<p>Draco didn't really feel like talking right now, but he managed
to say, through gritted teeth, "Could be revenge. For the
date."</p>
<p>"Really," said Granger. "After all this time."</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>"How sweet of him," said Granger.</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>"I guess I'll find some truly romantic way to thank him," said
Granger.</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>"What's he got against <i>you?</i>" said Granger.</p>
<p>Stick. Plop.</p>
<p>The icy wind howled around them.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>One might have thought it would feel safer to have ground under
your feet again.</p>
<p>But if that ground was a slanted roof tiled with rough slats,
which had rather a lot more ice on it than the stone walls, and you
were running across it at a high rate of speed...</p>
<p>Then you would be <i>sadly mistaken.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Luminos!</i>" shouted Draco.</p>
<p>"<i>Luminos!</i>" shouted Granger.</p>
<p>"<i>Luminos!</i>" shouted Draco.</p>
<p>"<i>Luminos!</i>" shouted Granger.</p>
<p>The distant figure was dodging and scrambling as it ran, and not
a single shot hit, but they were gaining.</p>
<p>Until Granger slipped.</p>
<p>It was inevitable, in retrospect, in real life you couldn't
<i>actually</i> run across icy slanted rooftops at a high rate of
speed.</p>
<p>And also inevitably, because it happened without the slightest
thought, Draco spun and grabbed for Granger's right arm, and he
<i>caught</i> her, only she was already too far off balance, she
was falling and pulling Draco with her, it all happened so quickly
-</p>
<p>There was a hard, painful impact, not just Draco's weight
hitting the rooftop but some of Granger's weight too, and if she'd
hit just a little bit closer to the edge they could have made it,
but instead her body tipped again and her legs slipped off and her
other hand grabbed frantically...</p>
<p>And that was how Draco ended up holding onto Granger's arm in a
white grip, while her other hand clenched frantically at the edge
of the rooftop and the toes of Draco's shoes dug into the edge of a
roof tile.</p>
<p>"<i>Hermione!</i>" Harry's voice shrieked distantly.</p>
<p>"Draco," whispered Granger's voice, and Draco looked down.</p>
<p>That might have been a mistake. There was a lot of air
underneath her, nothing but air, they were on the edge of a rooftop
that had jutted out from the main stone wall of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"He's going to come help me," whispered the girl, "but first
he's going to <i>Luminos</i> both of us, there's no way he
wouldn't. You have to let me go."</p>
<p>It should have been the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>She was just a mudblood, just a mudblood, <i>just a
mudblood!</i></p>
<p>She wouldn't even be <i>hurt!</i></p>
<p>...Draco's brain wasn't listening to anything Draco was telling
it right now.</p>
<p>"Do it," Hermione Granger whispered, her eyes blazing without a
single trace of fear, "do it, Draco, do it, you can beat him
yourself <i>we have to win Draco!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a sound of someone running and it was coming
closer.</p>
<p><i>Oh, be rational...</i></p>
<p>The voice in Draco's head sounded an awful lot like Harry Potter
teaching lessons.</p>
<p>...<i>are you going to let your brain run your life?</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, 1:</i></p>
<p>It was taking a bit of an effort for Daphne Greengrass to keep
herself quiet, as Millicent Bulstrode retold the story in the
Slytherin girls' common room (a cozy cool place in the dungeons
running beneath the Hogwarts Lake, with fish swimming past every
window, and couches you could lie down in if you wanted). Mostly
because, in Daphne's opinion, it was a perfectly good story already
without all of Millicent's <i>improvements</i>.</p>
<p>"And then what?" gasped Flora and Hestia Carrow.</p>
<p>"General Granger looked up at him," Millicent said dramatically,
"and she said, 'Draco! You've got to let go of me! Don't worry
about me, Draco, I promise I'll be all right! And what do you
suppose Malfoy did then?"</p>
<p>"He said 'Never!'," shouted Charlotte Wiland, "and held on even
tighter!"</p>
<p>All the listening girls except Pansy Parkinson nodded.</p>
<p>"Nope!" said Millicent. "He dropped her. And then he jumped up
and shot General Potter. The end."</p>
<p>There was a stunned pause.</p>
<p>"You can't <i>do</i> that!" said Charlotte.</p>
<p>"She's a <i>mudblood,</i>" said Pansy, sounding confused. "Of
<i>course</i> he let go!"</p>
<p>"Well, Malfoy shouldn't have grabbed her in the first place,
then!" said Charlotte. "But once he grabbed her, he <i>had</i> to
hang on! <i>Especially</i> in the face of approaching certain
doom!" Tracey Davis, sitting next to Daphne, was nodding along in
firm agreement.</p>
<p>"I don't see why," said Pansy.</p>
<p>"That's because you don't have the tiniest smidgin of romance in
you," said Tracey. "Besides, you can't just go dropping girls. A
boy who'd drop a girl like that... he'd drop <i>anyone.</i> He'd
drop <i>you,</i> Pansy."</p>
<p>"What d'you mean, <i>drop me?</i>" Pansy said.</p>
<p>Daphne couldn't resist any more. "You know," Daphne said darkly,
"you're eating breakfast one day at our table, and the next thing
you know, Malfoy <i>lets go of you,</i> and you're falling off the
top of Hogwarts! That's what!"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" said Charlotte. "He's a witch dropper!"</p>
<p>"You know why Atlantis fell?" said Tracey. "'Cause someone like
Malfoy <i>dropped</i> it, that's why!"</p>
<p>Daphne lowered her voice. "In fact... what if Malfoy's the one
who made Hermione, I mean General Granger, slip in the first place?
What if he's out to make <i>all</i> the Muggleborns trip and
fall?"</p>
<p>"You mean - ?" gasped Tracey.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Daphne said dramatically. "What if Malfoy is -
<i>the heir of Slipperin?</i>"</p>
<p>"The next Drop Lord!" said Tracey.</p>
<p>Which was far too good a line for anyone to keep to themselves,
so by nightfall it was all over Hogwarts, and the next morning it
was the <i>Quibbler's</i> headline.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, 2:</i></p>
<p>Hermione made sure she got to their usual classroom nice and
early that evening, just so that she would be by herself, in a
chair, peacefully reading a book, when Harry got there.</p>
<p>If there was any way for a door to creak open apologetically,
that was how the door was creaking open.</p>
<p>"Um," said Harry Potter's voice.</p>
<p>Hermione kept reading.</p>
<p>"I'm, um, kinda sorry, I didn't mean for you to <i>actually</i>
fall off the roof or anything..."</p>
<p>It had been quite an entertaining experience, in fact.</p>
<p>"I, ah... I don't have much experience apologizing, I'll fall to
my knees if you want, or buy you something expensive, <i>Hermione I
don't know how to apologize to you for this what can I do just tell
me?</i>"</p>
<p>She kept reading the book in silence.</p>
<p>It wasn't as if <i>she</i> had any idea how Harry could
apologize, either.</p>
<p>Right now she was just feeling a sort of odd curiosity as to
what would happen if she kept reading her book for a while.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="42">Chapter 42</h2><h3>Courage</h3>
<p>"<i>Romantic?</i>" Hermione said. "They're both
<i>boys!</i>"</p>
<p>"Wow," Daphne said, sounding a little shocked. "You mean Muggles
really <i>do</i> hate that? I thought that was just something the
Death Eaters made up."</p>
<p>"No," said an older Slytherin girl Hermione didn't recognize,
"it's true, they have to get married in secret, and if they're ever
discovered, they get burned at the stake together. And if you're a
girl who thinks it's romantic, they burn you too."</p>
<p>"That can't be right!" objected a Gryffindor girl, while
Hermione was still trying to sort out what to say to that. "There
wouldn't be any Muggle girls <i>left!</i>"</p>
<p>She'd kept on reading quietly, and Harry Potter had kept on
trying to apologize, and it had soon dawned on Hermione that Harry
had realized, possibly for the first time in his life, that he'd
done something annoying; and that Harry, definitely for the first
time in his life, was <i>terrified</i> that he'd lost her as a
friend; and she'd started to feel (a) guilty and (b) worried about
the direction Harry's increasingly desperate offers were going. But
she still had no idea what sort of apology was appropriate, so
she'd said that the Ravenclaw girls should vote on it - and this
time she wouldn't fix the outcome, though she hadn't mentioned that
part - to which Harry had instantly agreed.</p>
<p>The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl over the age of
thirteen had voted to have Draco drop Harry.</p>
<p>Hermione had felt mildly disappointed it was that simple, though
it was obviously fair.</p>
<p>Right now, however, standing just outside the great doors of the
castle amid half the female population of Hogwarts, Hermione was
beginning to suspect that there were <i>things</i> going on here
that she did not understand and that she desperately hoped neither
of her fellow generals ever heard about.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>You couldn't really see the details from up there, just the
general fact of a sea of expectant female faces.</p>
<p>"You've got no idea what this is about, do you?" said Draco,
sounding amused.</p>
<p>Harry had read a fair number of books he wasn't supposed to
read, not to mention a few <i>Quibbler</i> headlines.</p>
<p>"Boy-Who-Lived gets Draco Malfoy pregnant?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Okay, you <i>do</i> know what this is about," said Draco. "I
thought Muggles hated that?"</p>
<p>"Only the dumb ones," said Harry. "But, um, aren't we, uh, a
little <i>young?</i>"</p>
<p>"Not too young for <i>them,</i>" said Draco. He snorted.
"<i>Girls!</i>"</p>
<p>They silently walked toward the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>"So <i>I'm</i> doing this for revenge on you," said Draco, "but
why are <i>you</i> doing this?"</p>
<p>Harry's mind made a lightning calculation, weighing the factors,
whether it was too soon...</p>
<p>"Honestly?" said Harry. "Because I meant to have her climb up
the icy walls, but I <i>didn't</i> mean to have her fall off the
roof. And, um, I kinda <i>did</i> feel really awful about that. I
mean, I guess I actually did start seeing her as my friendly rival
after a while. So this is a real apology to her, not a plot or
anything."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Draco. "I understand."</p>
<p>Harry didn't smile. It might have been the most difficult
nonsmile of his life.</p>
<p>Draco looked at the edge of the roof, and made a face. "This is
going to be a lot harder to do on purpose than by accident, isn't
it."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry's other hand held the roof in a reflexively terrified
grip, his fingers white on the cold, cold stone.</p>
<p>You could know with your conscious mind that you'd drunk the
Feather-Falling Potion. Knowing it with your unconscious mind was
another matter entirely.</p>
<p>It was every bit as scary as Harry had thought it might have
been for Hermione, which was justice.</p>
<p>"Draco," said Harry, controlling his voice wasn't easy, but the
Ravenclaw girls had given them a script, "You've got to let me
go!"</p>
<p>"Okay!" said Draco, and let go of Harry's arm.</p>
<p>Harry's other hand scrabbled at the edge, and then, without any
decision being made, his fingers failed, and Harry fell.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when Harry's stomach tried to leap up
into his throat, and his body tried desperately to orient itself in
the absence of any possible way to do so.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when Harry could feel the
Feather-Falling Potion kicking in, starting to slow him, a sort of
lurching, cushioning feeling.</p>
<p>And then something <i>pulled</i> on Harry and he accelerated
downward again <i>faster than gravity -</i></p>
<p>Harry's mouth had already opened and begun screaming while part
of his brain tried to think of something creative he could do, part
of his brain tried to calculate how much time he had left to be
creative, and a tiny rump part of his brain noticed that he wasn't
even going to finish the remaining-time calculation before he hit
the ground -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry was desperately trying to control his hyperventilating,
and it wasn't helping him to hear the shrieking of all the girls,
now lying in heaps on the ground and each other.</p>
<p>"Good heavens," said the unfamiliar man, he of the old-looking
clothes and faintly scarred face, who was holding Harry in his
arms. "Of all the ways I imagined we might meet again someday, I
didn't expect it to be you falling out of the sky."</p>
<p>Harry remembered the last thing he'd seen, the falling body, and
managed to gasp, "Professor... Quirrell..."</p>
<p>"He'll be all right after a few hours," said the unfamiliar man
holding Harry. "He's just exhausted. I wouldn't have thought it
possible... he must have knocked down <i>two hundred students</i>
just to make sure he got whoever was jinxing you..."</p>
<p>Gently, the man set Harry upright on the ground, supporting him
the while.</p>
<p>Harry carefully balanced himself, and nodded to the man.</p>
<p>He let go, and Harry promptly fell over.</p>
<p>The man helped him rise again. Making sure, at all times, to
stand between Harry and the girls now picking themselves up from
the ground, his head constantly glancing in that direction.</p>
<p>"Harry," the man said quietly, and very seriously, "do you have
any idea which of these girls might have wanted to kill you?"</p>
<p>"Not murder," said a strained voice. "Just stupidity."</p>
<p>This time it was the unfamiliar man who seemed to almost fall
over, utter shock on his face.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was already sitting up from where he'd fallen
on the grass.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" gasped the man. "You shouldn't be -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Lupin, your concerns are misplaced. No wizard, no matter
how powerful, casts such a Charm by strength alone. You must do it
by being <i>efficient.</i>"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell didn't stand up, though.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry whispered. And then, "Thank you," to the man
standing beside him as well.</p>
<p>"What happened?" said the man.</p>
<p>"I should have foreseen it myself," Professor Quirrell said, his
voice crisp with disapproval. "Some number of girls tried to summon
Mr. Potter to their own, particular arms. Individually, I suppose,
they all thought they were being gentle."</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>"Consider it a lesson in preparedness, Mr. Potter," said
Professor Quirrell. "Had I not <i>insisted</i> that there be more
than one adult witness to this little event, and that <i>both</i>
of us have our wands out, Mr. Lupin would not have been available
to slow your fall afterward, and you would have been gravely
injured."</p>
<p>"<i>Sir!</i>" said the man - Mr. Lupin, apparently. "You should
not say such things to the boy!"</p>
<p>"Who is -" Harry started to say.</p>
<p>"The only other person who was available to watch, besides
myself," said Professor Quirrell. "I introduce you to Remus Lupin,
who is here temporarily to instruct students in the Patronus Charm.
Though I am told that the two of you have already met."</p>
<p>Harry studied the man, puzzled. He should have remembered that
faintly scarred face, that strange, gentle smile.</p>
<p>"Where did we meet?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"In Godric's Hollow," said the man. "I changed a number of your
nappies."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Mr. Lupin's temporary office was a small stone room with a small
wooden desk, and Harry couldn't see anything of what Mr. Lupin was
sitting on, suggesting that it was a small stool just like the one
in front of his desk. Harry guessed that Mr. Lupin wouldn't be at
Hogwarts for long, or use this office much, and so he'd told the
house elves not to waste the effort. It said something about a
person that he tried not to bother house elves. Specifically, it
said that he'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to the best of
Harry's knowledge, Hermione was the only non-Hufflepuff who worried
about bothering house elves. (Harry himself thought her qualms
rather silly. Whoever had created house elves in the first place
had been unspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn't mean Hermione
was doing the right thing <i>now</i> by denying sentient beings the
drudgery they had been shaped to enjoy.)</p>
<p>"Please sit down, Harry," the man said quietly. His formal robes
were of low quality, not quite tattered, but visibly worn by the
passage of time in a way that simple Repair Charms couldn't fix;
<i>shabby</i> was the word that came to mind. And despite that,
somehow, there was a dignity about him that couldn't have been
obtained by fine and expensive robes, that wouldn't have <i>fit</i>
with fine robes, that was the exclusive property of the shabby.
Harry had <i>heard</i> of humility, but he'd never seen the real
thing before - only the satisfied modesty of people who thought it
was part of their style and wanted you to notice.</p>
<p>Harry took a seat on the small wooden stool in front of Mr.
Lupin's short desk.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming," the man said.</p>
<p>"No, thank <i>you</i> for saving me," said Harry. "Let me know
if you ever need something impossible done."</p>
<p>The man seemed to hesitate. "Harry, may I... ask a personal
question?"</p>
<p>"You can ask, certainly," Harry said. "I have a lot of questions
for you, too."</p>
<p>Mr. Lupin nodded. "Harry, are your stepparents treating you
well?"</p>
<p>"My <i>parents</i>," Harry said. "I have four. Michael, James,
Petunia, and Lily."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Mr. Lupin. And then, "Ah" again. He seemed to be
blinking rather hard. "I... that is good to hear, Harry, Dumbledore
would tell none of us where you were... I was afraid he might think
you ought to have wicked stepparents, or some such... "</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure Mr. Lupin's concern had been misplaced,
considering his own first encounter with Dumbledore; but it had all
turned out well enough, so he said nothing. "What about my..."
Harry searched for a word that didn't raise them higher or put them
lower... "<i>other</i> parents? I want to know, well,
everything."</p>
<p>"A tall order," Mr. Lupin said. He wiped a hand across his
forehead. "Well, let us begin at the beginning. When you were born,
James was so happy that he couldn't touch his wand without it
glowing gold, for a whole week. And even after that, whenever he
held you, or saw Lily holding you, or just thought of you, it would
happen again -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Every now and then Harry would look at his watch, and find that
another thirty minutes had passed. He felt slightly bad about
making Remus miss dinner, especially since Harry himself would just
drop back to 7pm later, but that wasn't enough to stop either of
them.</p>
<p>Finally Harry screwed up enough courage to ask the critical
question, while Remus was in the middle of an extended discourse on
the wonders of James's Quidditch that Harry couldn't find the heart
to squash more directly.</p>
<p>"And that was when," Remus said, his eyes shining brightly,
"James pulled off a <i>triple reverse Mulhanney Dive</i> with
<i>extra backspin!</i> The whole crowd went wild, even some of the
Hufflepuffs were cheering -"</p>
<p><i>I guess you had to be there,</i> Harry thought - not that
being there would have helped in any way - and said, "Mr.
Lupin?"</p>
<p>Something about Harry's voice must have reached the man, because
he stopped in mid-sentence.</p>
<p>"Was my father a bully?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Remus looked at Harry for a long moment. "For a little while,"
Remus said. "He grew out of it soon enough. Where did you hear
that?"</p>
<p>Harry didn't answer, he was trying to think of something true to
say that would deflect suspicion, but he didn't think fast
enough.</p>
<p>"Never mind," said Remus, and sighed. "I can guess who." The
faintly scarred face was pinched in disapproval. "What a thing to
tell -"</p>
<p>"Did my father have any extenuating circumstances?" Harry said.
"Poor home life, or something like that? Or was he just... being
naturally nasty?" <i>Cold?</i></p>
<p>Remus's hand swept his hair back, the first nervous gesture
Harry had seen from him. "Harry," Remus said, "you can't judge your
father by what he did as a young boy!"</p>
<p>"<i>I'm</i> a young boy," Harry said, "and I judge
<i>myself.</i>"</p>
<p>Remus blinked twice at that.</p>
<p>"I want to know <i>why</i>," Harry said. "I want to
<i>understand</i>, because to me, it seems like there isn't any
possible excuse for that!" Voice shaking a bit. "Please tell me
anything you know about why he did it, even if it doesn't sound
nice." <i>So I don't fall into the same trap myself, whatever it
is.</i></p>
<p>"It was the thing to do if you were in Gryffindor," Remus said,
slowly, reluctantly. "And... I didn't think so back then, I thought
it was the other way around, but... it might have been <i>Black</i>
who got <i>James</i> into it, really... Black wanted so much to
show everyone that he was against Slytherin, you see, we all wanted
to believe that blood wasn't destiny -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"No, Harry," said Remus. "I don't know why Black went after
Peter instead of running. It was as though Black was making tragedy
for the sake of tragedy that day." The man's voice was unsteady.
"There was no hint, no warning, we all thought - to think that he
was to be -" Remus's voice cut off.</p>
<p>Harry was crying, he couldn't help it, it hurt worse to hear it
from Remus than anything he'd ever felt himself. Harry had lost two
parents he didn't remember, knew only from stories. Remus Lupin had
lost all four of his best friends in less than twenty-four hours;
and for the loss of his last remaining one, Peter Pettigrew,
there'd just been no reason at all.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it still hurts to think of him in Azkaban," Remus
finished, his voice almost a whisper. "I am glad, Harry, that Death
Eaters are not allowed visitors. It means I do not have to feel
ashamed of not going."</p>
<p>Harry had to swallow hard several times before he could speak.
"Can you tell me about Peter Pettigrew? He was my father's friend,
and it seems - that I should know, that I should remember -"</p>
<p>Remus nodded, water glittering in his own eyes now. "I think,
Harry, that if Peter had known it would end that way -" the man's
voice choked up. "Peter was more afraid of the Dark Lord than any
of us, and if he'd known it would end that way, I don't think he
would have done it. But Peter knew the <i>risk</i>, Harry, he knew
the risk was real, that it <i>could</i> happen, and yet he stayed
by James and Lily's side. All through Hogwarts I used to wonder why
Peter hadn't been sorted into Slytherin, or maybe Ravenclaw,
because Peter so adored secrets, he couldn't resist them, he would
find out things about people, things they wanted kept hidden -" A
brief wry look crossed Remus's face. "But he didn't <i>use</i>
those secrets, Harry. He just wanted to know. And then the Dark
Lord's shadow fell over everything, and Peter stood by James and
Lily and put his talents to good use, and I understood why the Hat
had sent him to Gryffindor." Remus's voice was fierce now, and
proud. "It's <i>easy</i> to stand by your friends if you're a hero
like Godric, bold and strong like people think Gryffindors should
be. But if Peter was more afraid than any of us, doesn't that also
make him the most brave?"</p>
<p>"It does," Harry said. His own voice was choked to where he
almost couldn't talk. "If you could, Mr. Lupin, if you have time,
there's someone else who I think should hear Peter Pettigrew's
story, a student in first-year Hufflepuff, named Neville
Longbottom."</p>
<p>"Alice and Frank's boy," said Remus, his voice turning sad. "I
see. It is not a happy story, Harry, but I can tell it again, if
you think it will help him."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>A brief silence fell.</p>
<p>"Did Black have <i>any</i> unfinished business with Peter
Pettigrew?" Harry said. "<i>Anything</i> that would make him seek
out Mr. Pettigrew, even if it wasn't a killing matter? Like a
secret Mr. Pettigrew knew, that Black wanted to know himself, or
wanted to kill him to hide?"</p>
<p>Something flickered in Remus's eyes, but the older man shook his
head, and said, "Not really."</p>
<p>"That means there <i>is</i> something," said Harry.</p>
<p>That wry smile appeared again beneath the salt-and-pepper
mustache. "You have a bit of Peter in you yourself, I see. But it's
not important, Harry."</p>
<p>"I'm a Ravenclaw, I'm not <i>supposed</i> to resist the
temptation of secrets. And," Harry said more seriously, "if it was
worth Black getting caught, I can't help but think it might
matter."</p>
<p>Remus looked quite uncomfortable. "I suppose I could tell you
when you're older, but really, Harry, it's <i>not</i> important!
Just something from our school days."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't have put his finger on exactly what tipped him
off; it might have been something about the exact tone of
nervousness in Remus's voice, or the way the man had said <i>when
you're older</i>, that sparked the sudden leap of Harry's
intuition...</p>
<p>"Actually," said Harry, "I think I've sort of guessed it
already, sorry."</p>
<p>Remus raised his eyebrows. "Have you?" He sounded a bit
skeptical.</p>
<p>"They were lovers, weren't they?"</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>Remus gave a slow, grave nod.</p>
<p>"Once," Remus said. "A long time ago. A sad affair, ending in
vast tragedy, or so it seemed to us all when we were young." The
unhappy puzzlement was plain on his face. "But I had thought that
long since over and done and buried beneath adult friendship, until
the day that Black killed Peter."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="43">Chapter 43</h2><h3>Humanism, Pt 1</h3>
<p>The gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>For some of the students it was a study hour, and others had
been let out of class. The first-years who'd signed up for it were
practicing a certain spell, a spell that was most advantageously
learned outdoors, beneath the bright sun and a clear blue sky,
rather than within the confines of any classroom. Cookies and
lemonade were also considered helpful.</p>
<p>The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you
twitched your wand once, twice, thrice, and four times with small
tilts at exactly the right relative angles, you shifted your
forefinger and thumb exactly the right distances...</p>
<p>The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach
anyone the spell before their fifth year. There had been a few
known cases of younger children learning it, and this had been
dismissed as "genius".</p>
<p>It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but
Harry was beginning to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that
the Ministry Committee of Curriculum would have been of greater
benefit to wizardkind if they had been used as landfill.</p>
<p>So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn't stop
you from learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be
extra careful and practice each part for a lot longer than usual,
that was all.</p>
<p>Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were
like that because they required more strength of magic than any
young student could muster. But the Patronus Charm <i>wasn't</i>
like that, it wasn't difficult because it needed too much magic, it
was difficult because it took <i>more</i> than mere magic.</p>
<p>It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your
heart, the loving memories, a different kind of strength that you
didn't need for ordinary spells.</p>
<p>Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times,
shifted his fingers exactly the right distances...</p>
<p><i>"Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you enough
books?"</i></p>
<p><i>"You can never have enough books... but you certainly tried,
it was a really, really, really good try..."</i></p>
<p>It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had
remembered and tried to put it into the spell.</p>
<p>Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a
gesture that didn't have to be precise, only bold and defiant.</p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>" cried Harry.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Not a single flicker of light.</p>
<p>When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, a
rather troubled look on his faintly scarred face.</p>
<p>Finally Remus shook his head. "I'm sorry, Harry," the man said
quietly. "Your wandwork was exactly right."</p>
<p>And there wasn't a flicker of light anywhere else, either,
because all the other first-years who were supposed to be
practicing their Patronus Charms had been glancing out of the
corners of their eyes at Harry instead.</p>
<p>The tears were threatening to come back into Harry's eyes, and
they weren't happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things,
Harry had never expected this.</p>
<p>There was something horribly humiliating about being informed
that you weren't happy enough.</p>
<p>What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn't,
that made Anthony's wand shine with that bright light?</p>
<p>Did Anthony love his own father more?</p>
<p>"What thought were you using to cast it?" said Remus.</p>
<p>"My father," Harry said, his voice trembling. "I asked him to
buy me some books before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they
were expensive, and then he asked me if they were enough -"</p>
<p>Harry didn't try to explain about the Verres family motto.</p>
<p>"Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry," said
Remus. He gestured toward where some other students were sitting on
the ground, looking disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. "You
won't be able to cast a Patronus Charm while you're feeling ashamed
of not being grateful enough." There was a gentle compassion in Mr.
Lupin's voice, and for a moment, Harry felt like hitting
something.</p>
<p>Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other
failures were sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also
been proclaimed perfect, and who were now supposed to be searching
for happier thoughts; by the looks of them they weren't making much
progress. There were many robes there trimmed in dark blue, and a
handful of red, and one lone Hufflepuff girl who was still crying.
The Slytherins hadn't even bothered showing up, except for Daphne
Greengrass and Tracey Davis, who were still trying to get the
gestures.</p>
<p>Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the
student whose failure had surprised him the most.</p>
<p>"So you couldn't do it either," Hermione said. She'd fled the
field at first, but she'd come back after that, and you had to look
closely at her reddened eyes to see that she'd been crying.</p>
<p>"I," Harry said, "I, I'd probably feel a lot worse about that if
you hadn't failed, you're the nicest, person I know, that I've ever
met, Hermione, and if <i>you</i> also can't do it, it means I might
still be, be good..."</p>
<p>"I should have gone to Gryffindor," Hermione whispered. She
blinked hard a few times, but she didn't wipe her eyes.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The boy and the girl walked forward together, definitely not
holding hands, but each drawing a kind of strength from the other's
presence, something that let them ignore the whispers of their
year-mates, as they walked through the hallway approaching the
great doors of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't been able to cast the Patronus Charm no matter what
happy thought he tried. People hadn't seemed surprised by that,
which made it even worse. Hermione hadn't been able to do it
either. People had been <i>very</i> surprised by that, and Harry
had seen her starting to get the same sidelong looks as him. The
other Ravenclaws who'd failed weren't getting those looks. But
Hermione was the Sunshine General, and her fans were treating it
like she'd failed them, somehow, like she'd betrayed a promise
she'd never made.</p>
<p>The two of them had gone to the library to research the Patronus
Charm, which was Hermione's way of dealing with distress, as it was
sometimes also Harry's. Study, learn, try to understand
<i>why...</i></p>
<p>The books had confirmed what the Headmaster had told Harry;
often, wizards who couldn't cast the Patronus Charm in practice
would be able to do so in the presence of a real Dementor, going
from flat failure all the way to a full corporeal Patronus. It
defied all logic, the Dementor's aura of fear ought to make it
<i>harder</i> to wield a happy thought; but that was the way it
was.</p>
<p>So the two of them were both going to give it one last try,
there was no way either of them wouldn't give it one last try.</p>
<p>It was the day the Dementor came to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Earlier, Harry had unTransfigured his father's rock from where
it usually rested on his pinky ring in the form of a tiny diamond,
and placed the huge gray stone back into his pouch. Just in case
Harry's magic failed entirely, when he confronted the darkest of
all creatures.</p>
<p>Harry had already started to feel pessimistic, and he wasn't
even in front of a Dementor yet.</p>
<p>"I bet you can do it and I can't," Harry said in a whisper. "I
bet that's what happens."</p>
<p>"It felt wrong to me," Hermione said, her voice even quieter
than his. "I tried it this morning and I realized. When I was doing
the brandish at the end, even before I said the words, it felt
wrong."</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything. He'd felt the same thing, right from
the start, though it had taken another five attempts using five
other happy thoughts before he'd been able to acknowledge it to
himself. Every time he tried to brandish his wand, it had felt
hollow; the spell he was trying to learn didn't fit him.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean we're going to be Dark Wizards," said Harry.
"Lots of people who can't cast the Patronus Charm aren't Dark
Wizards. Godric Gryffindor wasn't a Dark Wizard..."</p>
<p>Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners from
Noble Houses and Muggles from wizards. He'd had many fine friends
and true, and lost no more than half of them in one good cause or
another. He'd listened to the screams of the wounded, in the armies
he'd raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of courage had
rallied to his calls, and he'd buried them afterward. Until
finally, when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his
old age, he'd brought together the three other most powerful
wizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from the bare ground; the one
great accomplishment to Godric's name that wasn't about war, any
kind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and not Godric,
who'd taught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had
taught the first Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green
growing life.</p>
<p>To his last day he'd never been able to cast the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.</p>
<p>Harry didn't believe in angst, he couldn't stand reading about
whiny heroes, he knew a billion other people in the world would
have given anything to trade places with him, and...</p>
<p>And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had
abandoned him, and Rowena passed before) that he didn't regret any
of it, and he was <i>not</i> warning his students not to follow in
his footsteps, no one was <i>ever</i> to say he'd told anyone not
to follow in his footsteps. If it had been the right thing for
<i>him</i> to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone else to choose
wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for
those who <i>did</i> follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would
remember that Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right
for them to be happier than him. That red and gold would be bright
warm colors, from now on.</p>
<p>And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was
Headmistress she would make sure of it.</p>
<p>Whereupon Godric had died, and left no ghost behind him; and
Harry had shoved the book back to Hermione and walked away a
little, so she wouldn't see him crying.</p>
<p>You wouldn't think that a book with an innocent title like "The
Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn't" would be the
saddest book Harry had ever read.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Harry didn't want that.</p>
<p>To be in that book.</p>
<p>Harry didn't want that.</p>
<p>The rest of the school just seemed to think that <i>No
Patronus</i> meant <i>Bad Person,</i> plain and simple. Somehow the
fact that Godric Gryffindor also hadn't been able to cast the
Patronus Charm seemed not to get repeated. Maybe people didn't talk
about it to respect his last wish, Fred and George probably didn't
know and Harry certainly wasn't about to tell them. Or maybe the
other failures didn't mention it because it was less shameful, the
smaller loss of pride and status, to be thought Dark rather than
unhappy.</p>
<p>Harry saw that Hermione, beside him, was blinking hard; and he
wondered if she was thinking of Rowena Ravenclaw, who'd also loved
books.</p>
<p>"Okay," Harry whispered. "Happier thoughts. If you do go to a
full corporeal Patronus, what do you think your animal will
be?"</p>
<p>"An otter," Hermione said at once.</p>
<p>"An <i>otter?</i>" Harry whispered incredulously.</p>
<p>"Yes, an otter," said Hermione. "What about yours?"</p>
<p>"Peregrine falcon," Harry said without hesitation. "It can dive
faster than three hundred kilometers per hour, it's the fastest
living creature there is." The peregrine falcon had been Harry's
favorite animal since forever. Harry was determined to become an
Animagus someday, just to get that as his form, and fly by the
strength of his own wings, and see the land below with sharper
eyes... "But why an <i>otter?</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, but didn't say anything.</p>
<p>And the vast doors of Hogwarts swung open.</p>
<p>They walked for a time, the children, over a pathway that led
toward the unforbidden forest, and continued through the forest
itself. The Sun was lowering to near the horizon, the shadows long,
the sunlight filtered through the bare branches of the winter
trees; for it was January, and the first-years the last to learn,
that day.</p>
<p>Then the path swerved and took a new direction, and they all saw
it in the distance, the clearing in the forest, and the sere winter
grounds, yellowing dried grass whitened by a few small remnants of
snow.</p>
<p>The human figures still small at that range. The two spots of
dim white light from the Aurors' Patronuses, and the brighter spot
of silver light from the Headmaster's, next to something...</p>
<p>Harry squinted.</p>
<p>Something...</p>
<p>It must have been purely Harry's imagination, because there
shouldn't have been any way for a Dementor to reach past three
corporeal Patronuses, but he thought he could feel a touch of
emptiness brushing at his mind, brushing straight at the soft inner
center of himself without any respect for Occlumency barriers.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the
students milling about on the withered and snow-spotted grass.
Seamus's Patronus Charm had been successful, but there was still
that interval between when the Headmaster dispelled his own
Patronus and when you were supposed to cast your own, when you
faced the Dementor's fear unshielded.</p>
<p>Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly
safe, even for an eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a
still-maturing brain. There was a lot of variance in how hard the
Dementor's power hit people, which was another thing not quite
understood; but twenty seconds was definitely safe.</p>
<p>Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might
<i>possibly</i> have been enough to cause permanent damage, though
only to the most sensitive subjects.</p>
<p>It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where
the way you learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on
one and told to get going. Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness,
and if you looked at the difference in maturity between a
fourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was
clear that Muggles were smothering their children... but even Harry
had started to wonder if this was pushing it. Not every hurt could
be healed afterward.</p>
<p>But if you couldn't cast the spell under those conditions, it
meant you couldn't rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend
yourself; overconfidence was even more dangerous to wizards than to
Muggles. Dementors could drain your magic and your physical
vitality, not just your happy thoughts, which meant you might
<i>not</i> be able to Apparate away if you waited too long, or if
you didn't recognize the approaching fear until the Dementor was
within range for its attack. (During his reading, Harry had
discovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the
Dementor's Kiss would <i>eat your soul</i> and that this was the
reason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the
victims. And that wizards who <i>believed this</i> had deliberately
used the Dementor's Kiss to <i>execute criminals.</i> It was a
certainty that some called criminals were innocent, and even if
they weren't, <i>destroying their souls?</i> If Harry had believed
in souls, he would have... drawn a blank, he just couldn't think of
an appropriate response to that.)</p>
<p>The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the
three Aurors standing guard. Their leader was an Asianish-looking
man, solemn without being grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left
his hand. His Patronus, an orangutan of solid moonlight, paced back
and forth between the Dementor and the first-years awaiting their
turn; beside the orangutan moved the bright white panther of Auror
Butnaru, a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a ponytail,
and a long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two
Patronuses, were all watching the Dementor. On the opposite side of
the students was the resting Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale
and unshaven, sitting back on a chair he'd conjured without word or
wand, and maintaining an absentminded pokerface as he scanned the
entire scene. Professor Quirrell had shown up not long after the
first-years began their attempts, and his eyes never strayed far
from Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick, who had been a champion
duellist, was fiddling absently with his wand; and <i>his</i> eyes,
peering out from within the huge puffy beard that served as his
face, stayed focused on Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>And it must have been Harry's imagination, but Professor
Quirrell seemed to wince slightly each time the Headmaster's
Patronus winked out to test the next student. Maybe Professor
Quirrell was imagining the same placebo effect as Harry, that
backwash of emptiness caressing at his mind.</p>
<p>"Anthony Goldstein," called the voice of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to
approach the shining silver phoenix, and... whatever it was beneath
the tattered cloak.</p>
<p>"What did you see?" Harry asked Seamus in a low voice.</p>
<p>A lot of students hadn't answered Harry, when he'd tried to
gather the data; but Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry's
lieutenants. Maybe that wasn't fair, but...</p>
<p>"Dead," said Seamus in a whisper, "grayish and slimy... dead and
left in water for a while... "</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "That's what a lot of people see," Harry said. He
projected confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus
needed it. "Go eat some chocolate, you'll feel better."</p>
<p>Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing
sweets.</p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>" cried a young boy's voice.</p>
<p>Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors.</p>
<p>Harry spun around to look -</p>
<p>There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony
Goldstein and the cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry,
and the cry was also silver, as bright and hard and beautiful as
metal.</p>
<p>And something in the back of Harry's mind said, <i>if that's a
peregrine falcon, I'm going to strangle him in his sleep.</i></p>
<p><i>Shut up,</i> Harry said to the thought, <i>do you want us to
be a Dark Wizard?</i></p>
<p><i>What's the point? You're going to end up as one
eventually.</i></p>
<p>That... wasn't something Harry would usually have thought...</p>
<p><i>It's a placebo effect,</i> Harry told himself again. <i>The
Dementor can't actually get to me through three corporeal
Patronuses, I'm just imagining what I think it's like. When I
actually face the Dementor, it'll feel completely different, and
then I'll know I was just being silly before.</i></p>
<p>A slight chill went down Harry's spine then, because he had a
feeling that yes, it <i>would</i> be completely different, and not
in a positive direction.</p>
<p>The blazing silver phoenix sprang back into existence from the
Headmaster's wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein
began to walk back.</p>
<p>The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out
the next name, the Patronus waiting behind to guard the
Dementor.</p>
<p>Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind
the glowing panther. Hermione's turn would have come next, but had
apparently just been delayed.</p>
<p>She looked stressed.</p>
<p>Earlier, she'd politely asked Harry to please stop trying to
destress her.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back
toward the others; smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster
looked very, very tired.</p>
<p>"Unbelievable," said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded much
weaker than his accustomed boom. "A corporeal Patronus, in his
first year. And an astounding number of successes among the other
young students. Quirinus, I must acknowledge that you have proved
your point."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell inclined his head. "A simple enough guess, I
should think. A Dementor attacks through fear, and children are
less afraid."</p>
<p>"<i>Less</i> afraid?" said Auror Goryanof from where he was
sitting.</p>
<p>"So I said as well," said Dumbledore. "And Professor Quirrell
pointed out that adults had more courage, not less to fear; which
thought, I confess, had never occurred to me before."</p>
<p>"That was not my <i>precise</i> phrasing," Professor Quirrell
said dryly, "but it will do. And the rest of our agreement,
Headmaster?"</p>
<p>"As you say," Dumbledore said reluctantly. "I admit I was not
expecting to lose that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your
wisdom."</p>
<p>All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione,
who was staring in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying
robes; and Harry, who was watching everyone, since he was imagining
himself feeling paranoid.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further
comments, "I am allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who
wish to learn it. Which will render them considerably safer from
Dark Wizards and other pests, and it is foolish to think they will
otherwise know no deadly magics." Professor Quirrell paused, his
eyes narrowing. "Headmaster, I respectfully observe that you are
not looking well. I suggest leaving the remainder of the day's task
to Professor Flitwick."</p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head. "We are almost done for the day,
Quirinus. I will last."</p>
<p>Hermione had approached Anthony. "Captain Goldstein," she said,
and her voice trembled only a little, "can you give me any
advice?"</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid," Anthony said firmly. "Don't think about
anything it tries to make you think about. You're not just holding
up the wand in front of you as a shield against the fear, you're
<i>brandishing</i> your wand to drive the fear away, that's how you
make a happy thought into something solid..." Anthony shrugged
helplessly. "I mean, I <i>heard</i> all that before, but..."</p>
<p>Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, with
their own questions.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger?" the Headmaster said. His voice might have been
gentle, or just weakened.</p>
<p>Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him.</p>
<p>"What did you see under the cloak?" Harry said to Anthony.</p>
<p>Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, "A very
tall man who was dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and
dead-colored... it hurt to see him and I knew that was the Dementor
trying to get at me."</p>
<p>Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cage
and the cloak.</p>
<p>Hermione raised her wand into position for the first
gestures.</p>
<p>The Headmaster's phoenix winked out of existence.</p>
<p>And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched -</p>
<p>- took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then
she brandished it and said "Expecto Patronum!"</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Hermione turned and ran.</p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>" said the Headmaster's deeper voice,
and the silver phoenix blazed back to life.</p>
<p>The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds
beginning to come from her throat.</p>
<p>"<i>Hermione!</i>" Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne, and
Ernie, and they all started to run toward her; even as Harry, who
was always thinking one step ahead, spun on his own heel and ran
for the table with the chocolate.</p>
<p>Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione's mouth
and she'd chewed and swallowed, she was still breathing in great
gasps and crying, her eyes still seemed unfocused.</p>
<p><i>She can't have been permanently Demented,</i> Harry thought
desperately at the confusion inside him, the horrible fear and
deathly fury beginning to twist around each other, <i>she can't
have been, she wasn't exposed for even ten seconds let alone forty
-</i></p>
<p>But she could be <i>temporarily</i> Demented, as Harry realized
in that moment, there wasn't any rule that you couldn't be
<i>temporarily</i> injured by a Dementor in just ten seconds if you
were sensitive enough.</p>
<p>Then Hermione's eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and
settle on him.</p>
<p>"Harry," she gasped, and the other students went silent. "Harry,
don't. <i>Don't!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn't do, was
<i>he</i> in her worst memories, or some sleep's nightmare that she
was now reliving in waking life?</p>
<p>"<i>Don't go near it!"</i> said Hermione. Her hand reached out,
grabbed him by the lapel of his robes. "You mustn't go near it,
Harry! <i>It spoke to me, Harry, it knows you, it knows you're
here!</i>"</p>
<p>"What -" Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking.</p>
<p>"<i>The Dementor!</i>" said Hermione. Her voice rose to a
shriek. "<i>Professor Quirrell wants it to eat you!</i>"</p>
<p>In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps;
but he didn't approach any closer (Harry was there, after all).
"Miss Granger," he said, and his voice was grave, "I think you
should have some more chocolate."</p>
<p>"<i>Professor Flitwick, don't let Harry try, send him
back!</i>"</p>
<p>The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor
Flitwick were exchanging worried looks.</p>
<p>"I did not hear the Dementor speak," the Headmaster said.
"Still..."</p>
<p>"Just ask," said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little
weary.</p>
<p>"Did the Dementor say <i>how</i> it would get to Harry?" said
the Headmaster.</p>
<p>"All his tastiest parts first," said Hermione, "it would - it
would eat -"</p>
<p>Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her
eyes.</p>
<p>Then she started crying.</p>
<p>"You were too brave, Hermione Granger," the Headmaster said. His
voice was gentle, and clearly audible. "Too much braver than I
comprehended. You should have turned and run, not endured and tried
to complete your Charm. When you are older and stronger, Miss
Granger, I know that you will try again, and I know that you will
succeed."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Hermione said in gasps, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry... I'm sorry, Harry, I can't tell you what I saw, I didn't
look at it, I didn't dare look at it, I knew it was too horrible to
ever be seen..."</p>
<p>It should have been Harry, but he'd hesitated, because his hands
were all chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping
Hermione from where she'd fallen on the grass, leading her toward
the snacks table.</p>
<p>Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right
again, and she went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but
she was always watching Harry, every time that he glanced in her
direction. He'd stepped toward her only once, and stopped when
she'd stepped away. Her eyes had silently apologized, and silently
pleaded for him to leave her be.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Neville Longbottom had seen something dead and half-dissolved,
oozing and running with a face like a squashed sponge.</p>
<p>It was the worst thing anyone had yet described seeing. Neville
had been able to produce a small flicker of light from his wand
before, but he had, intelligently and with great presence of mind,
turned and run away instead of trying to cast his own Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>(The Headmaster had said nothing to the other students, told no
one else to be less brave; but Professor Quirrell had calmly
observed that if you made the mistake <i>after</i> being warned,
that was when ignorance became stupidity.)</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell?" Harry said in a low voice, having come as
close to the Defense Professor as he dared. "What do <i>you</i> see
when you -"</p>
<p>"Don't ask." The voice was very flat.</p>
<p>Harry nodded respectfully. "What was your <i>original</i>
phrasing to the Headmaster, if I can ask?"</p>
<p>Dryly. "Our worst memories can only grow worse as we grow
older."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "Logical."</p>
<p>Something strange flickered in Professor Quirrell's eyes, then,
as he looked at Harry. "Let us hope," Professor Quirrell said,
"that you succeed upon this try, Mr. Potter. For if you do, the
Headmaster may teach you his trick of using a Patronus to send
messages that cannot be forged or intercepted, and the military
importance of that is impossible to overstate. It would be a
tremendous advantage to the Chaos Legion, and someday, I suspect,
this entire country. But if you do <i>not</i> succeed, Mr.
Potter... well, <i>I</i> shall understand."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, "Ouch", and
Dumbledore had recast his Patronus right away.</p>
<p>Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a
tiger, larger than Dumbledore's phoenix, though not nearly as
bright. There had been a great burst of applause from all the
watchers, though not the same shock as when Anthony had done
it.</p>
<p>And then it was Harry's turn.</p>
<p>The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry was
afraid.</p>
<p>Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that
it was going to hurt.</p>
<p>But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a
Dementor, a wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full
corporeal Patronus, and no one understood why.</p>
<p>And because if Harry <i>couldn't</i> defend himself from
Dementors, he had to be able to recognize their approach, recognize
the feeling of them in his mind, and run before it was too
late.</p>
<p><i>What is my worst memory...?</i></p>
<p>Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or
a hopeful look, or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore
only watched him with quiet calm.</p>
<p><i>He thinks I'm going to fail, but he won't sabotage me by
telling me so,</i> thought Harry, <i>if he had true words of
encouragement to speak, he would speak them...</i></p>
<p>The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted
away to nothing, not yet.</p>
<p>The cloak came closer. It was unraveling and shot through with
unpatched holes; it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had
said.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" Harry said. "What do you see?"</p>
<p>The Headmaster's voice was also calm. "The Dementors are
creatures of fear, and as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so
does the fearsomeness of its form. I see a tall, thin, naked man.
He is not decaying. He is only slightly painful to look upon. That
is all. What do you see, Harry?"</p>
<p>...Harry couldn't see under the cloak.</p>
<p>Or that wasn't right, it was that his mind was <i>refusing</i>
to see what was under the cloak...</p>
<p>No, his mind was trying to see the <i>wrong</i> thing under the
cloak, Harry could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake. But
Harry had done his best to train himself to notice that tiny
feeling of confusion, to automatically flinch away from making
stuff up; and every time his mind tried to start inventing a lie
about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to shut
it down.</p>
<p>Harry looked under the cloak and saw...</p>
<p>An open question. Harry wouldn't let his mind see something
false, and so he didn't see anything, like the part of his visual
cortex getting that signal was just ceasing to exist. There was a
blind spot under the cloak. Harry couldn't know what was under
there.</p>
<p>Just that it was far worse than any decaying mummy.</p>
<p>The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but
the blazing bird of moonlight, the white phoenix, yet lay between
them.</p>
<p>Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had.
Half the ones who'd had no luck with their Patronus Charms just
hadn't shown up today in the first place. Of those remaining, half
had fled before the Headmaster had even dispelled his own Patronus,
and no one had said a word. There'd been a little laughter when
Terry had turned and walked back before his own try; and Susan and
Hannah, who'd gone before, had yelled at everyone to shut up.</p>
<p>But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect
if he was seen to give up without even trying...</p>
<p>Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the
presence of whatever lay beneath the cloak.</p>
<p><i>Why am I still here?</i></p>
<p>It wasn't the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept
Harry's feet in place.</p>
<p>It wasn't the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up
his wand.</p>
<p>It wasn't the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, that
moved his fingers into the initial position.</p>
<p>It was something else, something that <i>had</i> to oppose
whatever lay beneath the cloak, this was the true darkness and
Harry had to find out whether it lay within him, the power to drive
it back.</p>
<p>Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his
book-shopping spree with his father, but instead, at the last
minute, facing the Dementor, a different memory occurred to him,
something he hadn't tried before; a thought that wasn't warm and
happy in the ordinary way, but felt righter, somehow.</p>
<p>And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terribly
bright and unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill
him, fill all of him like an Occlumency barrier across his entire
mind, became once again the bodiless awareness of the void.</p>
<p>The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.</p>
<p>And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God.</p>
<p><b>FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS</b></p>
<p>There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when
the peaceful starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as
Harry's fingers began the wand motions, practiced until they had
become automatic. They weren't warm and happy, those blazing points
of light in perfect blackness; but it was an image the Dementor
could not easily pierce. For the silent burning stars were vast and
unafraid, and to shine in the cold and darkness was their natural
state.</p>
<p>But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable
object trying to resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a
twinge of anger at the Dementor for trying to feed on him, and it
was like slipping on wet ice. Harry's mind began to slide sideways,
into bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred -</p>
<p>Harry's wand came up in the final brandish.</p>
<p>It felt wrong.</p>
<p>"Expecto Patronum," his voice spoke, the words hollow and
pointless.</p>
<p>And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side,
further and faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as
the slide accelerated, as the Dementor latched onto the exposed and
vulnerable parts and fed on them, eating away the light. A fading
reflex scrabbled for warmth, but even as an image of Hermione came
to him, or an image of Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted it, showed
him Hermione lying dead on the ground, the corpses of his mother
and father, and then even that was sucked away.</p>
<p>Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something
forgotten so long ago that the neural patterns shouldn't have still
existed.</p>
<p><i>"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him!" shouted a man's voice.
"Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"</i></p>
<p><i>And Harry couldn't help but think, in the empty depths of his
dark side, how ridiculously overconfident James Potter had been.
Hold off Lord Voldemort? With what?</i></p>
<p><i>Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a
teakettle, and it was like dry ice laid on Harry's every nerve,
like a brand of metal cooled to liquid helium temperatures and laid
on every part of him. And the voice said:</i></p>
<p><i>"Avadakedavra."</i></p>
<p>(The wand flew from the boy's nerveless fingers as his body
began to convulse and fall, the Headmaster's eyes widening in alarm
as he began his own Patronus Charm.)</p>
<p><i>"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" screamed the
woman's voice.</i></p>
<p><i>Whatever was left of Harry listened with all the light
drained out of him, in the dead void of his heart, and wondered if
she thought that Lord Voldemort would stop because she asked
politely.</i></p>
<p><i>"Step aside, woman!" said the shrill voice of burning cold.
"For you I am not come, only the boy."</i></p>
<p><i>"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy..."</i></p>
<p><i>Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed not to understand what
type of people became Dark Lords in the first place; and if this
was the best strategy she could conceive to save her child's life,
that was her final failure as a mother.</i></p>
<p><i>"I give you this rare chance to flee," said the shrill voice.
"But I will not trouble myself to subdue you, and your death here
will not save your child. Step aside, foolish woman, if you have
any sense in you at all!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!"</i></p>
<p><i>The empty thing that was Harry wondered if Lily Potter
seriously imagined that Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, and
then depart leaving her son unharmed.</i></p>
<p><i>"Very well," said the voice of death, now sounding coldly
amused, "I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to
live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you."</i></p>
<p><i>There was a hideous silence.</i></p>
<p><i>Lord Voldemort began to laugh, horrible contemptuous
laughter.</i></p>
<p><i>And then, at last, Lily Potter's voice shrieked in desperate
hate, "Avada ke-"</i></p>
<p><i>The lethal voice finished first, the curse rapid and
precise.</i></p>
<p><i>"Avadakedavra."</i></p>
<p><i>A blinding flare of green marked the end of Lily
Potter.</i></p>
<p><i>And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson
eyes, seeming to glow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns,
filling Harry's whole vision as they locked to his own -</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The other children saw Harry Potter fall, they heard Harry
Potter scream, a thin high-pitched scream that seemed to pierce
their ears like knives.</p>
<p>There was a brilliant silver flash as the Headmaster bellowed
"<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>" and the blazing phoenix returned to
being.</p>
<p>But Harry Potter's horrible scream went on and on and on, even
as the Headmaster scooped up the boy in his arms and bore him away
from the Dementor, even as Neville Longbottom and Professor
Flitwick both went for the chocolate at the same time and -</p>
<p>Hermione knew it, she knew it as she saw it, she knew that her
nightmare had been real, it was coming true, somehow it was coming
true.</p>
<p>"Get him chocolate!" demanded the voice of Professor Quirrell,
pointlessly, because Professor Flitwick's tiny form was already
cannonballing toward where the Headmaster was racing toward the
students.</p>
<p>Hermione was moving forward herself, though she didn't know what
else she meant to do -</p>
<p>"<i>Cast Patronuses!</i>" shouted the Headmaster, as he brought
Harry behind the Aurors. "<i>Everyone who can! Get them between
Harry and the Dementor! It's still feeding on him!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a moment of frozen horror.</p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>" shouted Professor Flitwick and Auror
Goryanof, and then Anthony Goldstein, but he failed the first time,
and then Parvati Patil, who succeeded, and then Anthony tried again
and his silver bird spread its wings and screamed at the Dementor,
and Dean Thomas roared the words like they had been written in
letters of fire and his wand gave birth to a towering white bear;
there were eight blazing Patronuses all in a line between Harry and
the Dementor, and Harry went on screaming and screaming as the
Headmaster laid him on the dried grass.</p>
<p>Hermione couldn't cast a Patronus Charm, so she ran toward where
Harry lay. In her mind, something tried to guess how long it had
been already. Was it twenty seconds? More?</p>
<p>There was a dreadful agony and bewilderment on the face of Albus
Dumbledore. His long black wand was in his hand, but he spoke no
spells, only looked down at Harry's convulsing body in horror -</p>
<p>Hermione didn't know what to do, she didn't know what to do, she
didn't understand what was happening, and the most powerful wizard
in the world seemed equally at a loss.</p>
<p>"<i>Use your phoenix!</i>" bellowed Professor Quirrell.
"<i>Take him far away from that Dementor!</i>"</p>
<p>Without a single word the Headmaster scooped up Harry in his
arms and vanished in a crack of fire along with the suddenly
appearing Fawkes; and the Headmaster's Patronus winked out, where
it had guarded the Dementor.</p>
<p>Horror and confusion and sudden babble.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter should recover," Professor Quirrell said, raising
his voice, but his tone now calm once again, "I think it was just
over twenty seconds."</p>
<p>Then the blazing white phoenix appeared again, like it was
flying before them from elsewhere, to Hermione Granger came the
creature of moonlight, and it cried to her in Albus Dumbledore's
voice:</p>
<p>"<i>It still feeds on him, even here! How? If you know, Hermione
Granger, you must tell me! Tell me!</i>"</p>
<p>The senior Auror turned to stare at her, and so did many
students. Professor Flitwick didn't turn, he was now leveling his
wand on Professor Quirrell, who was holding out clearly empty
hands.</p>
<p>Seconds ticked past, uncounted.</p>
<p>She couldn't remember it, she couldn't remember the nightmare
clearly, she couldn't remember why she had thought it was possible,
why she had been afraid -</p>
<p>Hermione realized then what she ought to do, and it was the
hardest decision of her life.</p>
<p>What if whatever had happened to Harry, happened to her too?</p>
<p>All her limbs cold as death, her vision gone dark, fear
overwhelming everything; she'd seen Harry dying, Mum and Dad dying,
all her friends dying, everyone dying, so that in the end, when she
died, she would be alone. That was her secret nightmare she'd never
talked about with anyone, that had given the Dementor its power
over her, the loneliest thing was to die alone.</p>
<p>She didn't want to go to that place again, she, she didn't, she
didn't want to stay there forever -</p>
<p><i>You have courage enough for Gryffindor,</i> said the calm
voice of the Sorting Hat in her memory, <i>but you will do what is
right in any House I give you. You will learn, you will stand by
your friends, in any House you choose. So don't be afraid, Hermione
Granger, just decide where you belong...</i></p>
<p>There was no time for deciding, Harry was dying.</p>
<p>"I can't remember now," said Hermione, her voice cracking, "but
just hold on, I'll go in front of the Dementor again..."</p>
<p>She started to run toward the Dementor.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, but he made no move
to stop her, only kept holding his wand on Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"<i>Everyone!</i>" shouted Auror Komodo in a voice of military
command. "<i>Get your Patronuses out of her way!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>FLITWICK!</i>" roared Professor Quirrell. "<i>SUMMON
POTTER'S WAND!</i>"</p>
<p>Even as Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick was already
crying "<i>Accio!</i>", and she saw the stick of wood zooming up
from where it had lain almost touching the Dementor's cage.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The eyes opened, dead and vacant.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" gasped a voice in the colorless world.
"<i>Harry! Speak to me!</i>"</p>
<p>The face of Albus Dumbledore leaned over into the field of
vision, which had been occupied by a distant marble ceiling.</p>
<p>"You're annoying," said the empty voice. "You should die."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="44">Chapter 44</h2><h3>Humanism, Pt 2</h3>
<p>"Fawkes," said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, "help him,
please -"</p>
<p>A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of
vision, looking down quizzically; and it began to croon.</p>
<p>The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing
onto which they could hold.</p>
<p>"You're noisy," said the voice, "you should die."</p>
<p>"Chocolate," Albus Dumbledore said, "you need chocolate, and
your friends - but I dare not take you back -"</p>
<p>Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick's
voice; whereupon Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension,
and cursed aloud at his own stupidity.</p>
<p>The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the
capacity to be amused.</p>
<p>And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of
fire.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick's raven
had flown to elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in
another crack of red and golden fire with Harry in his arms; but
somehow in that time Hermione had already managed to fill her hands
with chocolate.</p>
<p>Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the
table and straight into Harry's mouth, which a tiny part of her
mind said was unfair, <i>he'd</i> gotten a chance to do it for
<i>her -</i></p>
<p>Harry spat the chocolate back out again.</p>
<p>"Go away," said a voice so empty it wasn't even cold.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving toward
Harry halted, all movements broken by the shock of those two dead
words.</p>
<p>Then: "No," said Albus Dumbledore, "I will not," and time
resumed again, even as another piece of chocolate zoomed off the
table and into Harry's mouth.</p>
<p>Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry's
expression become more hateful, as his mouth chewed with a
mechanical, unnatural rhythm.</p>
<p>The Headmaster's voice was grim as iron. "Filius, call Minerva,
tell her she must come at speed."</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew
into the air and vanished.</p>
<p>Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry's mouth, and the
mechanical chewing continued.</p>
<p>There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster
watched over Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender,
Ernie, Terry, Anthony, none of them daring to approach any closer
than Hermione had.</p>
<p>"What can we do?" said Dean in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Back off and give him more space -" said the dry voice of
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"No!" interrupted the Headmaster. "Let him be surrounded by his
friends."</p>
<p>Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice,
"They're stupid. They should die<i>mmmppphhh</i>" as another piece
of chocolate entered his mouth.</p>
<p>Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.</p>
<p>"He doesn't mean it, does he?" Seamus said it like he was
begging.</p>
<p>"You don't understand," Hermione said, her voice breaking,
"<i>that's not Harry -</i>" and she shut up before she said
anything more, but she <i>had</i> to say that much.</p>
<p>She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and
she also saw that the others didn't. If Harry had really never
thought anything like that, then being exposed to a Dementor for
less than a minute wouldn't have made him say it. That's what they
were probably thinking.</p>
<p>Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn't create a whole
new evil person inside you out of nothing.</p>
<p>But if that person was <i>already there</i> -</p>
<p><i>Does the Headmaster know?</i></p>
<p>Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus
Dumbledore was gazing at <i>her</i>, and that his blue eyes had
grown suddenly piercing -</p>
<p>Words came into her mind.</p>
<p><i>Do not speak of it,</i> said the will of Dumbledore to
her.</p>
<p><i>You know,</i> thought Hermione. <i>About his dark
side.</i></p>
<p><i>I know. But this is beyond even that. Fawkes's song cannot
reach him, where he is lost.</i></p>
<p><i>What can we -</i></p>
<p><i>I have a plan,</i> sent the Headmaster. <i>Patience.</i></p>
<p>Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous.
<i>What sort of plan?</i></p>
<p><i>It is better that you not know,</i> sent the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Now Hermione was getting <i>really</i> nervous. She didn't know
how <i>much</i> the Headmaster knew about Harry's dark side -</p>
<p><i>A fair point,</i> sent the Headmaster. <i>I am about to tell
you; steel yourself so as not to react. Are you ready? Good. I am
going to pretend to cast the Killing Curse on Professor McGonagall
- DO NOT REACT, Hermione!</i></p>
<p>That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn't
bring Harry <i>out</i> of his dark side, Harry would go
<i>completely berserk</i>, he'd <i>kill</i> the Headmaster -</p>
<p><i>But that is not true darkness,</i> sent Albus Dumbledore.
<i>That is protectiveness, that is love. Fawkes will be able to
reach him, then. And when Harry sees that Minerva is alive after
all, it will return him fully.</i></p>
<p>The thought came to Hermione -</p>
<p><i>I doubt that will work,</i> sent the Headmaster, <i>and you
may not like the way he reacts if you try. But you may try if you
wish.</i></p>
<p>She hadn't really meant that seriously! It was too -</p>
<p>Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to
the boy looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept
chewing and swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect.
Her heart wrenched, and suddenly a lot of things didn't seem to
matter, only that there was a chance.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The
response to compulsion was killing.</p>
<p>People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The
response to annoyance was killing.</p>
<p>Other people were chattering in the background. That was
insolent. The response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since
none of them were useful, killing them would be simpler.</p>
<p>Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them
didn't trust Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right
trigger could cause them all to kill each other.</p>
<p>Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did
something completely strange, something that belonged to a foreign
mode of thought, for which there was only a single response stored
anywhere -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>She heard the gasps around her, and they didn't matter, she
maintained the kiss on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears
welled in her eyes.</p>
<p>And Harry's arms came up and pushed her away, and his lips
yelled, "<i>I told you, no kissing!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"I think he'll be all right now," the Headmaster said, looking
at where Harry was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned
over him. "Excellently done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I
would have expected that to actually work?"</p>
<p>The phoenix's song wasn't meant for her, Hermione knew, but she
could still be soothed by it, which she needed, because her life
was officially over.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="45">Chapter 45</h2><h3>Humanism, Pt 3</h3>
<p>Fawkes's song gently trailed off into nothing.</p>
<p>Harry sat up from where he had lain on the winter-blasted grass,
Fawkes still perched on his shoulder.</p>
<p>There were intakes of breath from all around him.</p>
<p>"Harry," said Seamus in a wavering voice, "are you all
right?"</p>
<p>The peace of the phoenix was still in him, and warmth, from
where Fawkes perched. Warmth, spreading out through him, and the
memory of the song, still alive in the phoenix's presence. There
were terrible things that had happened to him, terrible thoughts
that had passed through him. He had regained an impossible memory,
for all that the Dementor had made him desecrate it. A strange word
kept echoing in his mind. And all of that could be put on hold for
later, while the phoenix still shone red and gold beneath the
setting sun.</p>
<p>Fawkes cawed at him.</p>
<p>"Something I have to do?" Harry said to Fawkes. "What?"</p>
<p>Fawkes bobbed its head in the direction of the Dementor.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the unseeable horror still in its cage, then
back at the phoenix, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter?" said Minerva McGonagall's voice from behind him.
"<i>Are</i> you all right?"</p>
<p>Harry climbed to his feet and turned.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall was looking at him, looking very worried;
Albus Dumbledore beside her was studying him carefully; Filius
Flitwick appeared tremendously relieved; and all the students were
just plain staring.</p>
<p>"I think so, Professor McGonagall," Harry said calmly. He'd
almost said <i>Minerva</i> before managing to stop himself. While
Fawkes was on his shoulder, at least, Harry was fine; it might be
that he would collapse a moment after Fawkes left, but somehow
thoughts like that didn't seem important. "I think I'm okay."</p>
<p>There ought to have been cheering, or sighs of relief, or
something, but no one seemed to know what to say, no one at
all.</p>
<p>The peace of the phoenix lingered.</p>
<p>Harry turned back. "Hermione?" he said.</p>
<p>Everyone with the tiniest smidgin of romance in their hearts
held their breath.</p>
<p>"I don't really know how to say thank you graciously," Harry
said quietly, "any more than I know how to apologize. All I can say
that if you're wondering whether it was the right thing to do, it
was."</p>
<p>The boy and the girl gazed into each other's eyes.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said. "About what happens next. If there's
anything I can do -"</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said back. "There isn't. It's all right, though."
Then she turned from Harry and walked away, toward the path that
led back to the gates of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>A number of girls gave Harry puzzled looks, and then followed
her. As they went, you could hear the excited questions
starting.</p>
<p>Harry looked at them as they left, turned back to look at the
other students. They'd seen him on the ground, screaming,
and...</p>
<p>Fawkes nuzzled his cheek, briefly.</p>
<p>...and that would help them, someday, understanding that the
Boy-Who-Lived could also be hurt, could be wretched. So that when
they were hurt and wretched themselves, they would remember seeing
Harry writhing on the ground, and know that their own pain and
troubles didn't mean they'd never amount to anything. Had the
Headmaster calculated that, when he had let the other students stay
and watch?</p>
<p>Harry's eyes went back to the tall tattered cloak, almost
absentmindedly, and without really being aware of what he was
speaking, Harry said, "It shouldn't ought to exist."</p>
<p>"Ah," said a dry, precise voice. "I thought you might say that.
I am very sorry to tell you, Mr. Potter, that Dementors cannot be
killed. Many have tried."</p>
<p>"Really?" Harry said, still absentmindedly. "What did they
try?"</p>
<p>"There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell,"
Professor Quirrell said, "which I will not name here; a spell of
cursed fire. It is what you would use to destroy an ancient device
such as the Sorting Hat. It has no effect on Dementors. They are
undying."</p>
<p>"They are not undying," said the Headmaster. The words mild, the
gaze sharp. "They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in
the world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger."</p>
<p>"Hm," Harry said. "Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it
be destroyed?"</p>
<p>"<i>Throw</i> it into the <i>Sun?</i>" squeaked Professor
Flitwick, looking like he wanted to faint.</p>
<p>"It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said dryly.
"The Sun is very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have
much effect on it. But it is not a test I would like to try, Mr.
Potter, just in case."</p>
<p>"I see," Harry said.</p>
<p>Fawkes cawed a final time, mantled his wings around Harry's
head, and then launched himself from Harry. Launched himself
straight toward the Dementor, screaming a great piercing cry of
defiance that echoed around the field. And before anyone could
react to that, there was a flash of fire, and Fawkes was gone.</p>
<p>The peace faded, a little.</p>
<p>The warmth faded, a little.</p>
<p>Harry took in a deep breath, let it out again.</p>
<p>"Yep," Harry said. "Still alive."</p>
<p>Again that silence, again the absence of cheering; no one seemed
to know how to respond -</p>
<p>"It is good to know you are fully recovered, Mr. Potter,"
Professor Quirrell said firmly, as though to deny any other
possibility. "Now, I believe Miss Ransom was up next?"</p>
<p>That started a bit of an argument, in which Professor Quirrell
was right and everyone else was wrong. The Defense Professor
pointed out that, despite the understandable emotions of all
concerned, the chance of a similar mishap occurring to any other
student verged on the infinitesimal; the more so as they now knew
to avoid mischances with wands. And meanwhile, there were other
students who needed to take their own best chance at casting a
corporeal Patronus Charm, or else learn the feeling of a Dementor
so they could flee, and discover their own degree of
vulnerability...</p>
<p>In the end it turned out that Dean Thomas and Ron Weasley of
Gryffindor were the only ones left who were still willing to go
anywhere near the Dementor, which simplified the argument.</p>
<p>Harry glanced in the Dementor's direction. The word echoed in
his mind again.</p>
<p><i>All right,</i> Harry thought to himself, <i>if the Dementor
is a riddle, what is the answer?</i></p>
<p>And just like that, it was obvious.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the tarnished, slightly corroded cage.</p>
<p>He saw what lay beneath the tall, tattered cloak.</p>
<p>That was it, then.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall came and spoke to Harry. She hadn't seen
the worst of it, so there was only a slight glitter of water in her
eyes. Harry told her that he needed to talk to her afterward and
ask a question he'd put off for a while, but that didn't need to
happen right now, if she was busy. There was a certain look about
her which suggested that she had been pulled away from something
important; and Harry observed this to her, and said that she
honestly didn't need to feel guilty about leaving. This earned him
something of a sharp look, but then leave she did, hurriedly, with
a promise that they would talk later.</p>
<p>Dean Thomas cast his white bear again, even in the Dementor's
presence; and Ron Weasley put up an adequate shield of sparkling
mist. Which concluded the day, so far as everyone else was
concerned, and Professor Flitwick began to herd the students back
to Hogwarts. When it was clear that Harry meant to stay behind,
Professor Flitwick looked at him quizzically; and Harry, for his
part, glanced significantly at Dumbledore. Harry didn't know what
Professor Flitwick made of that, but after a sharp gaze of warning,
his Head of House departed.</p>
<p>And so remained only Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster
Dumbledore, and an Auror trio.</p>
<p>It would have been better to get rid of the trio first, but
Harry couldn't think of a good way to do that.</p>
<p>"All right," said Auror Komodo, "let's take it back."</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said. "I'd like to have another go at the
Dementor."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry's request met with a certain amount of opposition of the
<i>you're completely insane</i> variety, though it was only Auror
Butnaru who actually said that out loud.</p>
<p>"Fawkes told me to," Harry said.</p>
<p>This did not overcome all the opposition, despite the look of
shock it produced on Dumbledore's face. The argument went on, and
it was starting to wear the edges off the phoenix's remaining
peace, which annoyed Harry, though only a little.</p>
<p>"Look," Harry said, "I'm pretty sure I know what I was doing
wrong before. There's a kind of person who has to use a different
sort of warm and happy thought. Just let me try it, okay?"</p>
<p>This did not prove persuasive either.</p>
<p>"I think," Professor Quirrell said finally, staring at Harry
with narrowed eyes, "that if we do not allow him to do this under
supervision, he may, at some point or another, sneak off and look
for a Dementor on his own. Do I accuse you falsely, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>There was an appalled pause at this. It seemed like a good time
to play his trump card.</p>
<p>"I don't mind if the Headmaster keeps his own Patronus up,"
Harry said. <i>For I will be in the presence of a Dementor just the
same, Patronus or no.</i></p>
<p>There was confusion at this, even Professor Quirrell looked
puzzled; but the Headmaster finally acceded, since it didn't seem
likely that Harry could be hurt through four Patronuses.</p>
<p><i>If the Dementor could not reach through your Patronus on some
level, Albus Dumbledore, you would not see a naked man painful to
look upon...</i></p>
<p>Harry didn't say it out loud, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And they began to walk toward the Dementor.</p>
<p>"Headmaster," Harry said, "suppose the Ravenclaw door asked you
this riddle: What lies at the center of a Dementor? What would you
say?"</p>
<p>"Fear," said the Headmaster.</p>
<p>It was a simple enough mistake. The Dementor approached, and the
fear came over you. The fear hurt, you felt the fear weakening you,
you wanted the fear to go away.</p>
<p>It was natural to think the fear was the problem.</p>
<p>So they'd concluded that the Dementor was a creature of pure
fear, that there was nothing there to fear but fear itself, that
the Dementor couldn't hurt you if you weren't afraid...</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p><i>What lies at the center of a Dementor?</i></p>
<p><i>Fear.</i></p>
<p><i>What is so horrible that the mind refuses to see it?</i></p>
<p><i>Fear.</i></p>
<p><i>What is impossible to kill?</i></p>
<p><i>Fear.</i></p>
<p>...it didn't quite fit, once you thought about it.</p>
<p>Though it was clear enough why people would be reluctant to look
beyond the first answer.</p>
<p>People <i>understood</i> fear.</p>
<p>People knew what they were supposed to <i>do</i> about fear.</p>
<p>So, faced with a Dementor, it wouldn't exactly be comforting to
ask: 'What if the fear is just a side effect rather than the main
problem?'</p>
<p>They had come very close to the Dementor's cage guarded by four
Patronuses, when there came sharp intakes of breath from the three
Aurors and Professor Quirrell. Everyone's faces turned to look at
the Dementor, seeming to listen; there was horror on Auror
Goryanof's face.</p>
<p>Then Professor Quirrell raised his head, his face hard, and spat
toward the Dementor.</p>
<p>"It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,"
Dumbledore said quietly. "Well. If it becomes necessary, Quirinus,
there will always be a refuge for you at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"What did it say?" said Harry.</p>
<p>Every head swung to stare at him.</p>
<p>"You didn't hear it...?" Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>"It said to me," said Professor Quirrell, "that it knew me, and
that it would hunt me down someday, wherever I tried to hide." His
face was rigid, showing no fright.</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. "I wouldn't worry about that, Professor
Quirrell." <i>It's not like Dementors can actually talk, or think;
the structure they have is borrowed from your own mind and
expectations...</i></p>
<p>Now everyone was giving him <i>very</i> strange looks. The
Aurors were glancing nervously at each other, at the Dementor, at
Harry.</p>
<p>And they stood directly before the Dementor's cage.</p>
<p>"They are wounds in the world," Harry said. "It's just a wild
guess, but I'm guessing the one who said that was Godric
Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"Yes..." said Dumbledore. "How did you know?"</p>
<p><i>It is a common misconception</i>, thought Harry, <i>that all
the best rationalists are Sorted into Ravenclaw, leaving none for
other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted into Ravenclaw indicates
that your strongest virtue is curiosity, wondering and desiring to
know the true answer. And this is not the</i> only <i>virtue a
rationalist needs. Sometimes you have to work hard on a problem,
and stick to it for a while. Sometimes you need a clever plan for
finding out. And sometimes what you need more than anything else to
see an answer, is the courage to face it...</i></p>
<p>Harry's gaze went to what lay beneath the cloak, the horror far
worse than any decaying mummy. Rowena Ravenclaw might also have
known, for it was an obvious enough riddle once you saw it as a
riddle.</p>
<p>And it was also obvious why the Patronuses were animals. The
animals didn't know, and so were sheltered from the fear.</p>
<p>But Harry knew, and would always know, and would never be able
to forget. He'd tried to teach himself to face reality without
flinching, and though Harry had not yet mastered that art, still
those grooves had been worn into his mind, the learned reflex to
look <i>toward</i> the painful thought instead of away. Harry would
never be able to forget by thinking warm happy thoughts about
something else, and that was why the spell hadn't worked for
him.</p>
<p>So Harry would think a warm happy thought that <i>wasn't</i>
about something else.</p>
<p>Harry drew forth his wand that Professor Flitwick had returned
to him, put his feet into the beginning stance for the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>Within his mind, Harry discarded the last remnants of the peace
of the phoenix, put aside the calm, the dreamlike state, remembered
instead Fawkes's piercing cry, and roused himself for battle.
Called upon all the pieces and elements of himself to awaken.
Raised up within himself all the strength that the Patronus Charm
could ever draw upon, to put himself into the right frame of mind
for the final warm and happy thought; remembered all bright
things.</p>
<p>The books his father had bought him.</p>
<p>Mum's smile when Harry had handmade her a mother's day card, an
elaborate thing that had used half a pound of spare electronics
parts from the garage to flash lights and beep a little tune, and
had taken him three days to make.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall telling him that his parents had died well,
protecting him. As they had.</p>
<p>Realizing that Hermione was keeping up with him and even running
faster, that they could be true rivals and friends.</p>
<p>Coaxing Draco out of the darkness, watching him slowly move
toward the light.</p>
<p>Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean and everyone else who
looked up to him, everyone that he would have fought to protect if
anything threatened Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Everything that made life worth living.</p>
<p>His wand rose into the starting position for the Patronus
Charm.</p>
<p>Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off
the Dementor even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added
the missing ingredient, he'd never truly seen it but he'd seen the
pictures and the video. The Earth, blazing blue and white with
reflected sunlight as it hung in space, amid the black void and the
brilliant points of light. It belonged there, within that image,
because it was what gave everything else its meaning. The Earth was
what made the stars significant, made them more than uncontrolled
fusion reactions, because it was Earth that would someday colonize
the galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the night sky.</p>
<p>Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's
children's children, the distant descendants of humankind as they
strode from star to star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were
only little nuisances, paling into nothingness in the light of that
promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. You had to
put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and
unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be
remembered someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive,
if you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into
the beginning of all things, before intelligent life had come fully
into its power. That the much vaster future depended on what you
did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there was still
so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like
Dementors.</p>
<p>Mum and Dad, Hermione's friendship and Draco's journey, Neville
and Seamus and Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun
and all bright things, the Earth, the stars, the promise,
everything humanity was and everything it would become...</p>
<p>On the wand, Harry's fingers moved into their starting
positions; he was ready, now, to think the right sort of warm and
happy thought.</p>
<p>And Harry's eyes stared directly at that which lay beneath the
tattered cloak, looked straight at that which had been named
Dementor. The void, the emptiness, the hole in the universe, the
absence of color and space, the open drain through which warmth
poured out of the world.</p>
<p>The fear it exuded stole away all happy thoughts, its closeness
drained your power and strength, its kiss would destroy everything
that you were.</p>
<p><i>I know you now</i>, Harry thought as his wand twitched once,
twice, thrice and four times, as his fingers slid exactly the right
distances, <i>I comprehend your nature, you symbolize Death,
through some law of magic you are a shadow that Death casts into
the world.</i></p>
<p><i>And Death is not something I will ever embrace.</i></p>
<p><i>It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not
yet outgrown.</i></p>
<p><i>And someday...</i></p>
<p><i>We'll get over it...</i></p>
<p><i>And people won't have to say goodbye any more...</i></p>
<p>The wand rose up and leveled straight at the Dementor.</p>
<p><i>"EXPECTO PATRONUM!"</i></p>
<p>The thought exploded from him like a breaking dam, surged down
his arm into his wand, burst from it as blazing white light. Light
that became corporeal, took on shape and substance.</p>
<p>A figure with two arms, two legs, and a head, standing upright;
the animal <i>Homo sapiens,</i> the shape of a human being.</p>
<p>Glowing brighter and brighter as Harry poured all his strength
into his spell, blazing with incandescent light brighter than the
fading sunset, the Aurors and Professor Quirrell shielding their
eyes in shock -</p>
<p><i>And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread from
star to star, they won't tell the children about the history of
Ancient Earth until they're old enough to bear it; and when they
learn they'll weep to hear that such a thing as Death had ever once
existed!</i></p>
<p>The figure of a human shone more brilliant now than the noonday
Sun, so radiant that Harry could feel the warmth of it on his skin;
and Harry sent out all his defiance at the shadow of Death, opening
all the floodgates inside him to make that bright shape blaze even
brighter and yet brighter.</p>
<p><i>You are not invincible, and someday the human species will
end you.</i></p>
<p><i>I will end you if I can, by the power of mind and magic and
science.</i></p>
<p><i>I won't cower in fear of Death, not while I have a chance of
winning.</i></p>
<p><i>I won't let Death touch me, I won't let Death touch the ones
I love.</i></p>
<p><i>And even if you do end me before I end you,</i></p>
<p><i>Another will take my place, and another,</i></p>
<p><i>Until the wound in the world is healed at last...</i></p>
<p>Harry lowered his wand, and the bright figure of a human faded
away.</p>
<p>Slowly, he exhaled.</p>
<p>Like waking up from a dream, like opening his eyes after sleep,
Harry's gaze moved away from the cage, he looked around and saw
that everyone was staring at him.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was staring at him.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was staring at him.</p>
<p>The Auror trio was staring at him.</p>
<p>They were all looking at him like they'd just seen him destroy a
Dementor.</p>
<p>The tattered cloak lay empty within the cage.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="46">Chapter 46</h2><h3>Humanism, Pt 4</h3>
<p>The last tip of the Sun was sinking below the horizon, the red
light fading from the treetops, only the blue sky illuminating the
six people standing upon the winter-dried and snow-spotted grass,
near a vacant cage on whose floor lay an empty, tattered cloak.</p>
<p>Harry felt... well, <i>normal</i> again. Sane-ish. The spell
hadn't undone the day and its damage, hadn't made the injuries as
if they had never been, but his hurts had been... bandaged,
meliorated? It was hard to describe.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was also looking healthier, though not fully
restored. The old wizard's head turned for a moment, locked eyes
with Professor Quirrell, then looked back to Harry. "Harry,"
Dumbledore said, "are you about to collapse in exhaustion and
possibly die?"</p>
<p>"No, strangely enough," Harry said. "That took something out of
me, but a lot less than I thought it would." <i>Or maybe it gave
something back, as well as taking...</i> "Honestly, I expected my
body to be hitting the ground with a thud about now."</p>
<p>There was a distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish
sort of sound.</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking care of that, Quirinus," said Dumbledore
to Professor Quirrell, who was now standing above and behind the
unconscious forms of the three Aurors. "I confess I am still
feeling a bit peaky. Though I shall handle the Memory Charms
myself."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell inclined his head, and then looked at Harry.
"I will omit a good deal of useless incredulity," said Professor
Quirrell, "remarks to the effect that Merlin himself failed to do
that, et cetera. Let us go straight to asking the important
question. What the sweet slithering snakes was <i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>"The Patronus Charm," Harry said. "Version 2.0."</p>
<p>"I rejoice to see that you are your usual self again," said
Dumbledore. "But you are not going <i>anywhere</i>, young
Ravenclaw, until you tell me what exactly was that warm and happy
thought."</p>
<p>"Hm..." said Harry. He tapped a contemplative finger on his
cheek. "I wonder if I should?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell suddenly grinned.</p>
<p>"Please?" said the Headmaster. "Pretty please with sugar on
top?"</p>
<p>Harry felt an impulse and decided to go with it. It was
dangerous, but there might not ever be a better opportunity until
the end of time.</p>
<p>"Three sodas," Harry said to his pouch, then looked up at the
Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts. "Gentlemen,"
Harry said, "I bought these sodas on my first visit to Platform
Nine and Three-Quarters, on the day I entered into Hogwarts. I have
been saving them for special occasions; there is a minor
enchantment on them to ensure they are drunk at the right time.
This is the last of my supply, but I do not think there will ever
come a finer occasion. Shall we?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore took a soda can from Harry, and Harry tossed another
to Professor Quirrell. The two older men each muttered identical
charms over the can and frowned briefly at the result. Harry, for
his part, simply popped the top and drank.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts politely
followed suit.</p>
<p>Harry said, "I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the
natural order."</p>
<p>It might not be the right kind of warm feeling you needed to
cast a Patronus Charm, but it was going into Harry's Top 10
nonetheless.</p>
<p>The looks he got from the Defense Professor and the Headmaster
briefly made Harry nervous, as the spilled Comed-Tea faded out of
existence; but then the two of them each glanced at the other and
both apparently decided that they couldn't get away with doing
anything really awful to Harry in the other's presence.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "even <i>I</i> know that
is not how things are supposed to work."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Dumbledore. "Explain."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth, and then, as realization hit him,
rapidly snapped his mouth shut again. Godric hadn't told anyone,
nor had Rowena if she'd known; there might have been any number of
wizards who'd figured it out and kept their mouths shut. You
couldn't forget if you <i>knew</i> that was what you were trying to
do; once you realized <i>how</i> it worked, the animal form of the
Patronus Charm would never work for you again - and most wizards
didn't have the right upbringing to turn on Dementors and destroy
them -</p>
<p>"Erm, sorry about this," said Harry. "But I've just this instant
realized that explaining would be an <i>incredibly</i> bad idea
until you work some things out on your own."</p>
<p>"Is that the truth, Harry?" Dumbledore said slowly. "Or are you
just pretending to be wise -"</p>
<p>"<i>Headmaster!</i>" said Professor Quirrell, sounding
genuinely shocked. "Mr. Potter has told you that this spell is not
spoken of with those who cannot cast it! You do not press a wizard
on such matters!"</p>
<p>"If I told you -" Harry began.</p>
<p>"No," Professor Quirrell said, sounding rather severe. "You
don't tell us <i>why,</i> Mr. Potter, you simply tell us that we
are not to know. If you wish to devise a hint, you do so carefully,
at leisure, not in the midst of conversation."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"But," said the Headmaster. "But, but what am I to tell the
Ministry? You can't just <i>lose</i> a Dementor!"</p>
<p>"Tell them I ate it," said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry to
choke on the soda he had unthinkingly raised to his lips. "I don't
mind. Shall we head on back, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>The two of them began to walk the dirt path back to Hogwarts,
leaving behind Albus Dumbledore staring forlornly at the empty cage
and the three sleeping Aurors awaiting their Memory Charms.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Harry Potter and Professor Quirrell:</i></p>
<p>They walked for a while before Professor Quirrell spoke, and all
background noise dropped into silence when he did.</p>
<p>"You are exceptionally good at killing things, my student," said
Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said sincerely.</p>
<p>"I am not prying," said Professor Quirrell, "but on the
off-chance that it was <i>only</i> the Headmaster who you did not
trust with the secret...?"</p>
<p>Harry considered this. Professor Quirrell already couldn't cast
the animal Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>But you couldn't untell a secret, and Harry was a fast enough
learner to realize that he ought to at least <i>think</i> for a
while before unleashing this one upon the world.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, and Professor Quirrell nodded
acceptance.</p>
<p>"Out of curiosity, Professor Quirrell," said Harry, "if your
bringing the Dementor to Hogwarts had been part of an evil plot,
what would have been its goal?"</p>
<p>"Assassinate Dumbledore while he was weakened," Professor
Quirrell said without even hesitating. "Hm. The Headmaster told you
he was suspicious of me?"</p>
<p>Harry said nothing for a second while he tried to think of a
reply, and then gave up when he realized he'd already answered.</p>
<p>"Interesting..." Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter, it is not
out of the question that there <i>was</i> a plot at work today.
Your wand ending up that close to the Dementor's cage <i>could</i>
have been an accident. Or one of the Aurors could have been
Imperiused, Confunded, or Legilimized to exert an influence.
Flitwick and myself should not be excluded as suspects, in your
calculation. One notes that Professor Snape canceled all his
classes today, and I suspect he is powerful enough to Disillusion
himself; the Aurors cast detection charms early on, but they did
not repeat them immediately before your turn. But most easily of
all, Mr. Potter, the deed could have been plotted by Dumbledore
himself; and if he <i>did</i>, why, he might also take steps in
advance to cast your suspicion elsewhere."</p>
<p>They walked on for a few steps.</p>
<p>"But why <i>would</i> he?" Harry said.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor stayed quiet a moment, and then said, "Mr.
Potter, what steps have you taken to investigate the Headmaster's
character?"</p>
<p>"Not many," said Harry. He'd only recently realized... "Not
nearly enough."</p>
<p>"Then I will observe," said Professor Quirrell, "that you do not
find out all there is to know about a man by asking only his
friends."</p>
<p>Now it was Harry's turn to walk a few steps in silence on the
slightly beaten dirt path that led back to Hogwarts. He'd really
been supposed to know better than that already. Confirmation bias
was the technical term; it meant, among other things, that when you
chose your information sources, there was a notable tendency to
choose information sources that agreed with your current
opinions.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said. "Actually... I didn't say it earlier,
did I? Thank you for <i>everything</i>. If another Dementor ever
threatens you, or for that matter, slightly annoys you, just let me
know and I'll introduce it to Mister Glowy Person. I don't like it
when Dementors slightly annoy my friends."</p>
<p>That got him an indecipherable glance from Professor Quirrell.
"You destroyed the Dementor because it threatened me?"</p>
<p>"Erm," Harry said, "I'd sort of decided on it before then, but
yes, that would have been sufficient reason by itself."</p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "And what would you have done
about the threat to me if your spell <i>hadn't</i> worked for
destroying the Dementor?"</p>
<p>"Plan B," said Harry. "Encase the Dementor in dense metal with a
high melting point, probably tungsten, drop it into an active
volcano, and hope it ends up inside Earth's mantle. Ah, the whole
planet is filled with molten lava under its surface -"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor Quirrell. "I know." The Defense Professor
was wearing a very odd smile. "I really should have thought of that
myself, all things considered. Tell me, Mr. Potter, if you wanted
to lose something where no one would ever find it again, where
would you put it?"</p>
<p>Harry considered this question. "I suppose I shouldn't ask
<i>what</i> you've found that needs losing -"</p>
<p>"Quite," said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and
then, "Perhaps you will be told when you are older," which Harry
hadn't.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "besides trying to get it into the molten
core of the planet, you could bury it in solid rock a kilometer
underground in a randomly selected location - maybe teleport it in,
if there's some way to do that blindly, or drill a hole and repair
the hole afterward; the important thing would be not to leave any
traces leading there, so it's just an anonymous cubic meter
somewhere in the Earth's crust. You could drop it into the Mariana
Trench, that's the deepest depth of ocean on the planet - or just
pick some random other ocean trench, to make it less obvious. If
you could make it buoyant and invisible, then you could throw it
into the stratosphere. Or ideally you would launch it into space,
with a cloak against detection, and a randomly fluctuating
acceleration factor that would take it out of the Solar System. And
afterward, of course, you'd Obliviate yourself, so even you didn't
know exactly where it was."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor was laughing, and it sounded even odder
than his smile.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell?" Harry said.</p>
<p>"All excellent suggestions," said Professor Quirrell. "But tell
me, Mr. Potter, why those exact five?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" said Harry. "They just seemed like the obvious sorts of
ideas."</p>
<p>"Oh?" said Professor Quirrell. "But there is an interesting
pattern to them, you see. One might say it sounds like something of
a riddle. I must admit, Mr. Potter, that although it has had its
ups and downs, on the whole, this has been a surprisingly good
day."</p>
<p>And they continued walking down the path that led to the gates
of Hogwarts, quite some distance apart; as Harry, without even
thinking about it, automatically stayed far enough away from the
Defense Professor not to trigger that sense of doom, which for some
reason seemed unusually strong right now.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass:</i></p>
<p>Hermione had refused to answer any questions, and as soon as
they'd passed the split leading to the Slytherin dungeons, Daphne
and Tracey had peeled off at once, walking as quickly as they
could. Rumor traveled fast in Hogwarts, so they'd have to go to the
dungeons right away if they wanted to be the first to tell everyone
the story.</p>
<p>"Now remember," said Daphne, "don't just blurt out about the
kiss as soon as we walk in, okay? It works better if we tell the
whole story in order."</p>
<p>Tracey nodded excitedly.</p>
<p>And as soon as they burst into the Slytherin common room, Tracey
Davis took a deep breath and shouted, "<i>Everyone! Harry Potter
couldn't cast the Patronus Charm and the Dementor almost ate him
and Professor Quirrell saved him but then Potter was all evil until
Granger brought him back with a kiss! It's true love for
sure!</i>"</p>
<p>It was ordered storytelling of a sort, Daphne supposed.</p>
<p>The news failed to produce the expected reaction. Most of the
girls glanced over and then stayed in their couches, or the boys
simply kept reading in their chairs.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Pansy sourly, from where she was sitting with
Gregory's feet in her lap, leaning back and reading what seemed to
be a coloring book, "Millicent already told us."</p>
<p><i>How -</i></p>
<p>"Why didn't <i>you</i> kiss him first, Tracey?" said Flora and
Hestia Carrow from their own chairs. "Now Potter's going to marry a
mudblood girl! <i>You</i> could've been his true love and gotten
into a rich Noble House and everything if you'd just kissed him
first!"</p>
<p>Tracey's face was a picture in stunned realization.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" shrieked Daphne. "Love does not work like
that!"</p>
<p>"Of course it does," stated Millicent from where she was
practicing some sort of Charm while looking out a window at the
swirling waters of the Hogwarts Lake. "First kiss gets the
prince."</p>
<p>"<i>It wasn't their first kiss!</i>" shouted Daphne. "Hermione
was <i>already</i> his true love! That's why <i>she</i> could bring
him back!" Then Daphne realized what she'd just said and winced
internally, but as the saying went, you had to fit the tongue to
the ear.</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?" said Gregory, swinging his feet off
Pansy's lap. "What's this? Miss Bulstrode didn't tell that
part."</p>
<p>Everyone else was also looking at Daphne, now.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," said Daphne, "Harry shoved her away and shouted, 'I
told you, no kissing!' Then Harry screamed like he was dying and
Fawkes started singing to him - I'm not sure which one of those
happened first, actually -"</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound like true love to <i>me,</i>" said the
Carrow twins. "That sounds like the <i>wrong person</i> kissed
him."</p>
<p>"It was supposed to be <i>me</i>," whispered Tracey. Her face
was still stunned. "<i>I</i> was supposed to be his true love.
Harry Potter was <i>my</i> general. I should've, I should've fought
Granger for him -"</p>
<p>Daphne spun on Tracey, incensed. "<i>You?</i> Take Harry away
from Hermione?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" said Tracey. "Me!"</p>
<p>"You're nuts," Daphne stated with conviction. "Even if you
<i>had</i> kissed him first, you know what that would make you? The
sad little lovestruck girl who dies at the end of Act Two."</p>
<p>"<i>You take that back!</i>" shouted Tracey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gregory had crossed the room to where Vincent was
doing his homework. "Mr. Crabbe," Gregory said in a low voice, "I
think Mr. Malfoy needs to know about this."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Hermione Granger:</i></p>
<p>Hermione stared at the wax-sealed paper, on the surface of which
was inscribed simply the number <i>42.</i></p>
<p><i>I figured out why we couldn't cast the Patronus Charm,
Hermione, it doesn't have anything to do with us not being happy
enough. But I can't tell you. I couldn't even tell the Headmaster.
It needs to be even more secret than partial Transfiguration, for
now, anyway. But if you ever need to fight Dementors, the secret is
written here, cryptically, so that if someone doesn't know it's
about Dementors and the Patronus Charm, they won't know what it
means...</i></p>
<p>She'd told Harry about seeing him dying, her parents dying, all
her friends dying, everyone dying. She hadn't told him about her
terror of dying alone, somehow that was still too painful.</p>
<p>Harry had told her about remembering his parents dying, and that
he'd thought it was funny.</p>
<p><i>There's no light in the place the Dementor takes you,
Hermione. No warmth. No caring. It's somewhere that you can't even
understand happiness. There's pain, and fear, and those can still
drive you. You can hate, and take pleasure in destroying what you
hate. You can laugh, when you see other people hurting. But you
can't ever be happy, you can't even remember what it is that isn't
there anymore... I don't think there's any way I can ever explain
just what you saved me from. I'm usually ashamed to put people to
trouble, I usually can't stand it when people make sacrifices for
me, but this one time I'll say that no matter what it ends up
costing you to have kissed me, don't ever doubt for a second that
it was the right thing to do.</i></p>
<p>Hermione hadn't realized how <i>little</i> the Dementor had
touched her, how small and shallow had been the darkness into which
it had taken her.</p>
<p>She'd seen everyone dying, and that had still been able to
hurt.</p>
<p>Hermione put the paper back into her pouch, like a good girl
ought to.</p>
<p>She'd really wanted to read it, though.</p>
<p>She was frightened of Dementors.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:</i></p>
<p>She felt frozen; she shouldn't have been so shocked, she
shouldn't have found Harry so hard to face, but after what he'd
been through... She had searched the young boy in front of her for
any signs of Dementation, and failed to find them. But something
about the calm with which he had asked such a foreboding question
seemed deeply worrying. "Mr. Potter, I can't possibly speak of such
matters without the Headmaster's permission!"</p>
<p>The boy in her office took this in without changing expression.
"I would prefer not to disturb the Headmaster over this matter,"
Harry Potter said calmly. "I <i>insist</i> on not disturbing him,
in fact, and you did promise that our conversation would be kept
private. So let me put it this way. I know that there was, in fact,
a prophecy. I know that you are the one who originally heard it
from Professor Trelawney. I know that the prophecy identified the
child of James and Lily as someone dangerous to the Dark Lord. And
I know who I am, indeed everyone now knows who I am, so you are
revealing nothing new or dangerous, if you tell me only this: What
was the <i>exact wording</i> which identified <i>me,</i> the child
of James and Lily?"</p>
<p>Trelawney's hollow voice echoed in her mind -</p>
<p><i>BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,<br />
BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES...</i></p>
<p>"Harry," said Professor McGonagall, "I can't possibly tell you
that!" It chilled her to the bone that Harry knew so much already,
she couldn't imagine how Harry had learned -</p>
<p>The boy looked at her with strange, sorrowful eyes. "Can you not
sneeze without the Headmaster's permission, Professor McGonagall?
For I do promise to you that I have good reason to ask, and good
reason to keep the question private."</p>
<p>"Please don't, Harry," she whispered.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said. "One simple question. Please. Was the
Potter family mentioned by <i>name?</i> Does the prophecy literally
say 'Potter'?"</p>
<p>She stared at Harry for a while. She couldn't have said why or
where she got the sense that this was a critical point, that she
could not lightly refuse the request, nor lightly accede to it
-</p>
<p>"No," she finally said. "Please, Harry, don't ask any more."</p>
<p>The boy smiled, a little sadly it seemed, and said, "Thank you,
Minerva. You are a good woman and true."</p>
<p>And while her mouth was still open in utter shock, Harry Potter
got up and left the office; and only then did she realize that
Harry had taken her refusal as an answer, and the true answer at
that -</p>
<p>Harry closed the door behind himself.</p>
<p>The logic had presented itself with a strange diamondlike
clarity. Harry couldn't have said if it had come to him during
Fawkes's singing, or maybe even before.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort had killed James Potter. He had preferred to
spare Lily Potter's life. He had continued his attack, therefore,
with the sole purpose of killing their infant child.</p>
<p>Dark Lords were not usually scared of infant children.</p>
<p>So there was a prophecy about Harry Potter being dangerous to
Lord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had known that prophecy.</p>
<p><i>"I give you this rare chance to flee. But I will not trouble
myself to subdue you, and your death here will not save your child.
Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at
all!"</i></p>
<p>Had it been a whim, to give her that chance? But then Lord
Voldemort would not have tried to persuade her. Had the prophecy
warned Lord Voldemort against killing Lily Potter? Then Lord
Voldemort <i>would</i> have troubled himself to subdue her. Lord
Voldemort had been <i>mildly</i> inclined not to kill Lily Potter.
The preference had been stronger than a whim, but not as strong as
a warning.</p>
<p>So suppose that someone whom Lord Voldemort considered a lesser
ally or servant, useful but not indispensable, had begged the Dark
Lord to spare Lily's life. Lily's, but not James's.</p>
<p>This person had known that Lord Voldemort would attack the house
of the Potters. Had known both the prophecy, and the fact that the
Dark Lord knew it. Otherwise he would not have begged Lily's
life.</p>
<p>According to Professor McGonagall, besides herself, the other
two who knew of the prophecy were Albus Dumbledore and Severus
Snape.</p>
<p>Severus Snape, who had loved Lily before she was Lily Potter,
and hated James.</p>
<p>Severus, then, had learned of the prophecy, and told it to the
Dark Lord. Which he had done because the prophecy had not described
the Potters by name. It had been a riddle, and Severus had solved
that riddle only too late.</p>
<p>But if Severus had been the <i>first</i> to hear the prophecy,
and disposed to tell it to the Dark Lord, then why would he also
have told Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall?</p>
<p>Therefore Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall had heard it
first.</p>
<p>The Headmaster of Hogwarts had no obvious reason to tell the
Transfiguration Professor about an extremely sensitive and crucial
prophecy. But the Transfiguration Professor had every reason to
tell the Headmaster.</p>
<p>It seemed likely, then, that Professor McGonagall had been the
first to hear it.</p>
<p>The prior probabilities said that it had been Professor
Trelawney, Hogwarts's resident seer. Seers were rare, so if you
counted up most of the seconds Professor McGonagall had spent in
the presence of a seer over the course of her lifetime, most of
those seer-seconds would be Trelawney-seconds.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall had told Dumbledore, and would have told no
one else about the prophecy without permission.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was Albus Dumbledore who had arranged for Severus
Snape to somehow learn of the prophecy. And Dumbledore himself had
solved the riddle successfully, or he would not have selected
<i>Severus</i>, who had once loved Lily, as the intermediary.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had deliberately arranged for Lord Voldemort to hear
about the prophecy, in hopes of luring him to his death. Perhaps
Dumbledore had arranged for Severus to learn only <i>some</i> of
the prophecy, or there were other prophecies of which Severus had
remained innocent... somehow Dumbledore had known that an
<i>immediate</i> attack on the Potters would still lead to Lord
Voldemort's <i>immediate</i> defeat, although Lord Voldemort
himself had not believed this. Or maybe that had just been a lucky
stroke of Dumbledore's insanity, his taste for bizarre plots...</p>
<p>Severus had ended up serving Dumbledore afterward; perhaps the
Death Eaters would not look kindly on Severus if Dumbledore
revealed his role in their defeat.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had tried to arrange for Harry's mother to be spared.
But that part of his plot had failed. And he had knowingly
condemned James Potter to his death.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents.
<i>If</i> the whole chain of logic was correct. Harry could not, in
justice, say that successfully ending the Wizarding War did not
count as extenuating circumstances. But somehow this still...
<i>bothered him a great deal.</i></p>
<p>And it was time and past time to ask Draco Malfoy what the
<i>other</i> side of that war had to say about the character of
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="47">Chapter 47</h2><h3>Personhood Theory</h3>
<p>There comes a point in every plot where the victim starts to
suspect; and looks back, and sees a trail of events all pointing in
a single direction. And when that point comes, Father had
explained, the prospect of the loss may seem so unbearable, and
admitting themselves tricked may seem so humiliating, that the
victim will yet deny the plot, and the game may continue long
after.</p>
<p>Father had warned Draco not to do that again.</p>
<p>First, though, he'd let Mr. Avery finish eating all of the
cookies he'd swindled from Draco, while Draco watched and cried.
The whole lovely jar of cookies that Father had given him just a
few hours earlier, for Draco had lost all of them to Mr. Avery,
down to the very last one.</p>
<p>So it was a familiar feeling that Draco had felt in the pit of
his stomach, when Gregory told him about The Kiss.</p>
<p>Sometimes you looked back, and saw things...</p>
<p>(In a lightless classroom - you couldn't quite call it
<i>unused</i> any more, since it'd seen weekly use over the last
few months - a boy sat enshrouded in a hooded cowl, with an
unlighted crystal globe on the desk in front of him. Thinking in
silence, thinking in darkness, waiting for an opening door to let
in the light.)</p>
<p>Harry had shoved Granger away and said, <i>I told you, no
kissing!</i></p>
<p>Harry would probably say something like, <i>She just did it to
annoy me, last time, just like she made me go on that date.</i></p>
<p>But the verified story was that Granger had been willing to face
the Dementor again in order to help Harry; that she had kissed
Harry, crying, when he was lost in the depths of Dementation; and
that her kiss had brought him back.</p>
<p>That didn't sound like rivalry, even friendly rivalry.</p>
<p>That sounded like the kind of friendship you usually didn't see
even in plays.</p>
<p>Then why had Harry made his friend climb the icy walls of
Hogwarts?</p>
<p>Because that was the sort of thing Harry Potter did to his
friends?</p>
<p>Father had told Draco that to fathom a strange plot, one
technique was to look at what <i>ended up</i> happening, assume it
was the <i>intended</i> result, and ask who benefited.</p>
<p>What had ended up happening as the result of Draco and Granger
fighting Harry Potter together... was that Draco had started to
feel a lot friendlier toward Granger.</p>
<p>Who benefited from the scion of Malfoy becoming friends with a
mudblood witch?</p>
<p>Who benefited, that was famous for exactly that sort of
plot?</p>
<p>Who benefited, that could possibly be pulling Harry Potter's
strings?</p>
<p>Dumbledore.</p>
<p>And if that was true then Draco would <i>have</i> to go to
Father and tell him everything, no matter what happened after that,
Draco couldn't imagine what would happen after that, it was awful
beyond imagining. Which made him want to cling desperately to the
last shred of hope that it wasn't all what it looked like...</p>
<p>...Draco remembered that, too, from Mr. Avery's lesson.</p>
<p>Draco hadn't planned to confront Harry yet. He was still trying
to think of an experimental test, something that Harry wouldn't
just see through and fake. But then Vincent had come with the
message that Harry wanted to meet early this week, on Friday
instead of Saturday.</p>
<p>And so here Draco was, in a dark classroom, an unlit crystal
globe on his desk, waiting.</p>
<p>Minutes passed.</p>
<p>Footsteps approached.</p>
<p>The door made a gentle creak as it swung open into the
classroom, revealing Harry Potter dressed in his own hood and cowl;
Harry stepped forward into the dark classroom, and the sturdy door
closed behind him with a faint click.</p>
<p>Draco tapped the crystal globe, and the classroom lit with
bright green light. Green light projected shadows of the desks onto
the floor, and glared back at him from the curved chair-backs,
photons bouncing off the wood in such fashion that the angle of
incidence equaled the angle of reflection.</p>
<p>At least <i>that</i> much of what he'd learned wasn't likely to
be a lie.</p>
<p>Harry had flinched as the light went on, halting for a moment,
then resumed his approach. "Hello, Draco," Harry said quietly,
drawing back his hood as he came to Draco's desk. "Thank you for
coming, I know it's not our usual time -"</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Draco said flatly.</p>
<p>Harry dragged one of the chairs to face Draco across his desk,
the legs making a slight screeching sound on the floor. He spun the
chair so that it was facing the wrong way, and sat down straddling
it, his arms folded across the back of the chair. The boy's face
was pensive, frowning, serious, looking very adult even for Harry
Potter.</p>
<p>"I have an important question to ask you," said Harry, "but
there's something else I want us to do before that."</p>
<p>Draco said nothing, feeling a certain weariness. Part of him
just wanted it all to be over with already.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Draco," said Harry. "Why don't Muggles ever leave
ghosts behind when they die?"</p>
<p>"Because Muggles don't have souls, obviously," Draco said. He
didn't even realize until after he'd said it that it might
contradict Harry's politics, and then he didn't care. Besides, it
<i>was</i> obvious.</p>
<p>Harry's face showed no surprise. "Before I ask my important
question, I want to see if you can learn the Patronus Charm."</p>
<p>For a moment the sheer nonsequitur stumped Draco. Good old
impossible-to-predict-or-understand Harry Potter. There were times
when Draco wondered whether Harry was deliberately this
disorienting as a tactic.</p>
<p>Then Draco understood, and shoved himself up and away from his
desk in a single angry motion. That was it. It was over. "Like
<i>Dumbledore's</i> servants," he spat.</p>
<p>"Like Salazar Slytherin," Harry said steadily.</p>
<p>Draco almost stumbled over his own feet in the middle of his
first stride toward the door.</p>
<p>Slowly, Draco turned back toward Harry.</p>
<p>"I don't know where you came up with that," said Draco, "but
it's wrong, everyone knows the Patronus Charm is a Gryffindor spell
-"</p>
<p>"Salazar Slytherin could cast a corporeal Patronus Charm," Harry
said. Harry's hand darted into his robes, brought out a book whose
title was written as white on green, and so almost impossible to
read in the green light; but it looked old. "I discovered that when
I was researching the Patronus Charm before. And I found the
original reference and checked the book out of the library just in
case you didn't believe me. The author of this book doesn't think
there's anything <i>unusual</i> about Salazar being able to cast a
Patronus, either; the belief that Slytherins can't do that must be
recent. And as a further historical note, though I don't have the
book with me, Godric Gryffindor never could."</p>
<p>After the first six times Draco had tried calling Harry's bluff,
on six successively more ridiculous occasions, he'd realized that
Harry just <i>didn't</i> lie about what was written in books.
Still, when Harry's hands opened the book and laid it out to the
place of a bookmark, Draco leaned over and studied the place where
Harry's finger pointed.</p>
<p><i>Then the fires of Ravenclaw fell upon the darkness that had
cloaked the left wing of Lord Foul's army, breaking it, and it was
revealed that the Lord Gryffindor had spoken true; the fear they
all had felt was not natural in its source, but coming from thrice
a dozen Dementors, who had been promised the souls of the defeated.
At once the Lady Hufflepuff and Lord Slytherin brought forth their
Patronuses, a vast angry badger and a bright silver serpent, and
the defenders lifted their heads as the shadow passed from their
hearts. And Lady Ravenclaw laughed, remarking that Lord Foul was a
great fool, for now his own army would be subject to the fear, but
not the defenders of Hogwarts. Yet the Lord Slytherin said, "No
fool he, that much I know." And the Lord Gryffindor beside him
studied the battlefield with a frown upon his face...</i></p>
<p>Draco looked back up. "So?"</p>
<p>Harry closed the book and put it into his pouch. "Chaos and
Sunshine both have soldiers that can cast corporeal Patronus
Charms. Corporeal Patronuses can be used to convey messages. If you
can't learn the spell, Dragon Army will be at a severe military
disadvantage -"</p>
<p>Draco didn't care about that right now, and told Harry so. His
voice was sharper than it probably should have been.</p>
<p>Harry didn't blink. "Then I'm calling in the favor you owe me
from that time I stopped a riot from breaking out, on our first day
of broomstick lessons. I'm going to try to teach you the Patronus
Charm, and for my favor, I want you to do your honest best to learn
and cast it. I trust to the honor of House Malfoy that you
will."</p>
<p>Draco felt that certain weariness again. If Harry had asked at
any other time, it would have been a fair return on favor owed,
given that it wasn't actually a Gryffindor spell. But...</p>
<p>"<i>Why?</i>" Draco said.</p>
<p>"To find out whether you can do this thing that Salazar
Slytherin could do," Harry said evenly. "This is an experimental
test, and I will not tell you what it means until after you have
done it. Will you?"</p>
<p>...It probably <i>was</i> a good idea to discharge that favor on
something innocuous, all the more so if it was time to break with
Harry Potter. "All right."</p>
<p>Harry drew a wand from his robes, and laid it against the globe.
"Not really the best color for learning the Patronus Charm," Harry
said. "Green light the exact shade of the Killing Curse, I mean.
But silver is a Slytherin color too, isn't it? <i>Dulak.</i>" The
light went out, and Harry whispered the first two phrases of the
Continual Light enchantment, recasting that part of it, though
neither of them could have cast the whole thing by themselves. Then
Harry tapped the globe again, and the room lit with a silver
radiance, brilliant but still soft and gentle. Color returned to
the desks and chairs, and to Harry's slightly sweaty face beneath
his shock of black hair.</p>
<p>It took that long for Draco to realize the implication. "You saw
a <i>Killing Curse</i> cast since the last time we met? When - how
-"</p>
<p>"Cast the Patronus Charm," Harry said, looking more serious than
ever, "and I'll tell you."</p>
<p>Draco pressed his hands to his eyes, shutting out the silver
light. "You know, I really should remember that you're too
<i>weird</i> for any <i>normal</i> plots!"</p>
<p>Within his self-imposed darkness, he heard the sound of Harry
snickering.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry watched closely as Draco finished his latest run-through
of the preliminary gestures, the part of the spell that was
difficult to learn; the final brandish and the pronunciation didn't
have to be precise. All three of the last runs had been perfect as
far as Harry could see. Harry had also felt an odd impulse to
adjust things that Mr. Lupin hadn't said anything about, like the
angle of Draco's elbow or the direction his foot was pointing; it
could have been entirely his own imagination, and probably was, but
Harry had decided to go with it just in case.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said quietly. There was a tension in his
chest that made it a little hard to speak. "Now we don't have a
Dementor here, but that's all right. We won't need one. Draco, when
your father spoke to me at the train station, he said that you were
the one thing in the world that was most precious to him, and he
threatened to throw away all his other plans to take vengeance on
me, if ever you came to harm."</p>
<p>"He... what?" There was a catch in Draco's voice, and a strange
look on his face. "Why are you telling me <i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I?" Harry didn't let his expression change, though
he could guess what Draco was thinking; that Harry had been
plotting to separate Draco from his father, and shouldn't be saying
anything that would bring them closer together. "There's always
been just one person who matters most to you, and I know exactly
what warm and happy thought will let you cast the Patronus Charm.
You told it to me at the train station before the first day of
school. Once you fell off a broomstick and broke your ribs. It hurt
more than anything you'd ever felt, and you thought you were going
to die. Pretend that fear is coming from a Dementor, standing in
front of you, wearing a tattered black cloak, looking like a dead
thing left in water. And then cast the Patronus Charm, and when you
brandish the wand to drive the Dementor away, think of how your
father held your hand, so that you wouldn't be afraid; and then
think of how much he loves you, and how much you love him, and put
it all into your voice when you say <i>Expecto Patronum.</i> For
the honor of House Malfoy, and not just because you promised me a
favor. Show me you didn't lie to me that day in the train station
when you told me Lucius was a good father. Show me you can do what
Salazar Slytherin could do."</p>
<p>And Harry stepped backward, behind Draco, out of Draco's field
of vision, so that Draco only faced the dusty old teacher's desk
and blackboard at the front of the unused classroom.</p>
<p>Draco cast one look behind him, that strange look still on his
face, and then turned away to face forward. Harry saw the
exhalation, the inhalation. The wand twitched once, twice, thrice,
and four times. Draco's fingers slid along the wand, exactly the
right distances -</p>
<p>Draco lowered his wand.</p>
<p>"This is too -" Draco said, "I can't <i>think</i> this right,
while you're watching -"</p>
<p>Harry turned around and started walking toward the door. "I'll
come back in a minute," Harry said. "Just hold to your happy
thought, and the Patronus will stay."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>From behind Draco came the sound of the door opening again.</p>
<p>Draco heard Harry's footsteps entering the classroom, but Draco
didn't turn to look.</p>
<p>Harry didn't say anything either. The silence stretched.</p>
<p>Finally -</p>
<p>"What does this <i>mean?</i>" Draco said. His voice wavered a
bit.</p>
<p>"It means you love your father," Harry's voice said. Which was
just what Draco had been thinking, and trying not to cry in front
of Harry. It was too right, just too right -</p>
<p>Before Draco, on the floor, was the shining form of a snake that
Draco recognized; a Blue Krait, a snake first brought to their
manor by Lord Abraxas Malfoy after a visit to some faraway land,
and Father had kept a Blue Krait in the ophidiarium ever since. The
thing about the Blue Krait was that the bite wouldn't hurt much.
Father had said that, and told Draco that he was <i>never</i>
allowed to pet the snake, no matter who was watching. The venom
killed your nerves so fast that you didn't have time to feel pain
as the poison spread. You could die of it even after using Healing
Charms. It ate other snakes. It was as Slytherin as any creature
could possibly be.</p>
<p>That was why a Blue Krait head had been forged into the handle
of Father's cane.</p>
<p>The bright snake darted out its tongue, which was also silver;
and seemed to <i>smile</i> somehow, in a warmer way than any
reptile should.</p>
<p>And then Draco realized -</p>
<p>"But," Draco said, still staring at the beautifully radiant
snake, "<i>you</i> can't cast the Patronus Charm." Now that Draco
had cast it himself, he understood why that was important. You
could be evil, like Dumbledore, and still cast the Patronus Charm,
so long as you had <i>something</i> bright left inside you. But if
Harry Potter didn't have a single thought inside him that shone
like that -</p>
<p>"The Patronus Charm is more complicated than you think, Draco,"
Harry said seriously. "Not everyone who fails at casting it is a
bad person, or even unhappy. But anyway, I <i>can</i> cast it. I
did it on my second try, after I realized what I'd done wrong
facing the Dementor my first time. But, well, my life gets a little
peculiar sometimes, and my Patronus came out strange, and I'm
keeping it a secret for now -"</p>
<p>"Am I supposed to just <i>believe</i> that?"</p>
<p>"You can ask Professor Quirrell if you don't believe me," said
Harry. "Ask him whether Harry Potter can cast a corporeal Patronus,
and tell him that I told you to ask. He'd know the request was from
me, no one else would know."</p>
<p>Oh, and now Draco was to trust <i>Professor Quirrell?</i> Still,
knowing Harry, it might be true; and Professor Quirrell wouldn't
lie for trivial reasons.</p>
<p>The glowing snake turned its head back and forth, as though
seeking a prey that wasn't there, and then coiled itself into a
circle, as though to rest.</p>
<p>"I wonder," Harry said softly, "when it was, which year, which
generation, that Slytherins stopped trying to learn the Patronus
Charm. When it was that people started to think, that Slytherins
themselves started to think, that being cunning and ambitious was
the same as being cold and unhappy. And if Salazar knew that his
students didn't even bother showing up to learn the Patronus Charm
any more, I wonder, would he wish that he'd never been born? I
wonder how it all went wrong, when Slytherin's House went
wrong."</p>
<p>The shining creature winked out, the turmoil rising in Draco
making it impossible to sustain the Charm. Draco spun on Harry, he
had to control himself not to raise his wand. "What do <i>you</i>
know about Slytherin House <i>or</i> Salazar Slytherin? <i>You</i>
were never Sorted into my House, what gives you the right to -"</p>
<p>And <i>that</i> was when Draco <i>finally</i> realized.</p>
<p>"<i>You did get Sorted into Slytherin!</i>" Draco said. "You
<i>did,</i> and afterwards you, you somehow, you <i>snapped your
fingers -</i>" Draco had once asked Father if it would be cleverer
to get Sorted into some other House so that everyone would trust
him, and Father had smiled and said that he'd thought of that too
at Draco's age, but there was no way to fool the Sorting Hat...</p>
<p>...not until <i>Harry Potter</i> came along.</p>
<p>How had he ever bought for <i>one minute</i> that <i>Harry</i>
was a <i>Ravenclaw?</i></p>
<p>"An interesting hypothesis," Harry said equably. "Do you know,
you're the second person in Hogwarts to come up with a theory along
those lines? At least you're the second that's actually said so to
my face -"</p>
<p>"Snape," Draco said with certainty. His Head of House was no
fool.</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell, <i>of course,</i>" said Harry. "Though come
to think, Severus did ask me how I managed to stay out of his
House, and whether I had something the Sorting Hat wanted. I
suppose you could say you're number three. Oh, but Professor
Quirrell's theory was a little different than yours, though. May I
have your word not to repeat it?"</p>
<p>Draco nodded without even really thinking about it. What was he
supposed to do, say no?</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell thought that Dumbledore wasn't happy with
the Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived."</p>
<p>And the instant Harry said it, Draco knew, he <i>knew</i> that
it was true, it was just <i>obvious</i>. Who did Dumbledore even
think he was fooling?</p>
<p>...well, besides every single other person in Hogwarts except
Snape and Quirrell, Harry might even believe it
<i>himself</i>...</p>
<p>Draco stumbled back over to his desk in something of a daze, and
sat down hard enough to hurt slightly. This sort of thing happened
around once a month with Harry, and it hadn't happened yet in
January, so it was time.</p>
<p>His fellow Slytherin, who might or might not think himself a
Ravenclaw, sat back down in the chair he'd used earlier, now
sitting on it crosswise, and looking up intently at Draco.</p>
<p>Draco didn't know <i>what</i> he should be doing now, whether he
should be trying to persuade the lost Slytherin boy that, no, he
<i>wasn't</i> actually a Ravenclaw... or trying to figure out
whether Harry was in league with Dumbledore, though that suddenly
seemed less likely... but then <i>why</i> had Harry set up the
whole thing with him and Granger...</p>
<p>He really <i>should</i> have remembered that Harry was too weird
for any normal plots.</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco said. "Did you deliberately antagonize me and
General Sunshine just so we'd work together against you?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded without hesitation, as though it was the most
normal thing in the world, and nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>"The whole thing with the gloves and making us climb up the
walls of Hogwarts, the <i>only point</i> was to make me and Granger
more friendly toward each other. And even before then. You've been
plotting it for a really long time. Since the
<i>beginning</i>."</p>
<p>Again the nod.</p>
<p>"<i>WHYYYYY?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's eyebrows lifted for a moment, the only reaction he
showed to Draco shrieking so loudly in the closed classroom that it
hurt his own ears. WHY, WHY, WHY did Harry Potter <i>DO</i> this
sort of thing...</p>
<p>Then Harry said, "So that Slytherins will be able to cast the
Patronus Charm again."</p>
<p>"<i>That... doesn't... make... SENSE!</i>" Draco was aware that
he was losing control of his voice, but he didn't seem able to stop
himself. "<i>What does that have to do with Granger?</i>"</p>
<p>"Patterns," Harry said. His face was very serious now, and very
grave. "Like a quarter of children born to Squib couples being
wizards. A simple, unmistakable pattern you would recognize
instantly, if you knew what you were looking at; even though, if
you didn't know, you wouldn't even realize it was a clue. The
poison in Slytherin House is something that's been seen before in
the Muggle world. This is an <i>advance</i> prediction, Draco, I
could have written it down for you before our first day of school,
just from hearing you talk in King's Cross Station. Let me describe
some really pathetic sorts of people that hang around at your
father's political rallies, pureblood families that would never be
invited to dinner at Malfoy Manor. Bearing in mind that <i>I've</i>
never met them, I'm just predicting it from recognizing the pattern
of what's happening to Slytherin House -"</p>
<p>And Harry Potter proceeded to describe the Parkinsons and
Montagues and Boles with a calmly cutting accuracy that Draco
wouldn't have dared <i>think</i> to himself in case there was a
Legilimens around, it was <i>beyond</i> insult, they would
<i>kill</i> Harry if they ever heard...</p>
<p>"To sum up," Harry finished, "they don't have any power
themselves. They don't have any wealth themselves. If they didn't
have Muggleborns to hate, if all the Muggleborns vanished the way
they say they <i>want</i>, they'd wake up one morning and find they
had <i>nothing.</i> But so long as they can say purebloods are
superior, they can feel superior themselves, they can feel like
part of the master class. Even though your father would never dream
of inviting them to dinner, even though there's not one Galleon in
their vaults, even if they did worse on their OWLs than the worst
Muggleborn in Hogwarts. Even if they can't cast the Patronus Charm
any more. Everything is the Muggleborns' fault to them, they have
someone besides themselves to blame for their own failures, and
that makes them even weaker. That's what Slytherin House is
becoming, <i>pathetic,</i> and the root of the problem is hating
Muggleborns."</p>
<p>"Salazar Slytherin himself said that mudbloods needed to be cast
out! That they were weakening our blood -" Draco's voice had risen
to a shout.</p>
<p>"<i>Salazar was wrong as a question of simple fact!</i> You
<i>know</i> that, Draco! And that <i>hatred</i> is poisoning your
whole House, you couldn't cast the Patronus Charm using a thought
like that!"</p>
<p>"Then why could <i>Salazar Slytherin</i> cast the Patronus
Charm?"</p>
<p>Harry was wiping sweat from his forehead. "Because things have
<i>changed</i> between then and now! Listen, Draco, three hundred
years ago you could find great scientists, as great as Salazar in
their own way, who would have told you that some other Muggles were
inferior because of their skin color -"</p>
<p>"<i>Skin color?</i>" said Draco.</p>
<p>"I know, skin color instead of anything important like blood
purity, isn't it ridiculous? But then something in the world
changed, and <i>now</i> you can't find any great scientists who
still think skin color should matter, only loser people like the
ones I described to you. Salazar Slytherin made the mistake when
everyone else was making it, because he grew up believing it, not
because he was <i>desperate for someone to hate.</i> There were a
few people who did better than everyone else around them, and
<i>they</i> were exceptionally good. But the ones who just accepted
what everyone else thought weren't <i>exceptionally</i> evil. The
sad fact is that most people just don't notice a moral issue at all
unless someone else is pointing it out to them; and once they're as
old as Salazar was when he met Godric, they've lost the ability to
change their minds. Only <i>then</i> Hogwarts was built, and
Hogwarts started sending acceptance letters to Muggleborns like
Godric insisted, and more and more people began to notice that
Muggleborns <i>weren't</i> any different. Now it's a big political
issue instead of something that everyone just believes without
thinking about it. And the <i>correct</i> answer is that
Muggleborns <i>aren't</i> any weaker than purebloods. So <i>now</i>
the people who end up siding with what Salazar once believed, are
either people who grew up in very closed pureblood environments
like you, <i>or</i> people who are so pathetic themselves that
they're desperate for someone to feel superior to, people who love
to hate."</p>
<p>"That doesn't... that doesn't sound right..." Draco's voice
said. His ears listened, and wondered that he couldn't come up with
anything better to say.</p>
<p>"It doesn't? Draco, you <i>know</i> now there's nothing wrong
with Hermione Granger. You had trouble dropping her off a roof, I
hear. Even though you knew she'd taken a Feather-Falling Potion,
even though you knew she was safe. What sort of person do you think
wants to <i>kill</i> her, not for any wrong she did to them, just
because she's a Muggleborn? Even though she's, she's just a young
girl who would help them with their homework in a second, if they
ever asked her," Harry's voice broke, "what sort of person wants
her to <i>die?</i>"</p>
<p><i>Father -</i></p>
<p>Draco felt split in two, he seemed to be having a problem with
dual vision, <i>Granger is a mudblood, she should die</i> and a
girl hanging from his hand on the rooftop, like seeing double,
seeing double -</p>
<p>"And anyone who <i>doesn't</i> want Hermione Granger to die,
won't want to hang around the sort of people who <i>do!</i> That's
all people think Slytherin <i>is</i> now, not clever planning, not
trying to achieve greatness, just hating Muggleborns! I paid Morag
a Sickle to ask Padma why she hadn't gone to Slytherin, we both
know she got the option. And Morag told me that Padma just gave her
a <i>look</i> and said that she wasn't Pansy Parkinson. You see?
The <i>best</i> students with the virtues of more than one House,
the students with <i>choices,</i> they go under the Hat thinking
<i>anywhere but Slytherin,</i> and someone like Padma ends up in
Ravenclaw. And... I think the Sorting Hat tries to maintain a
balance in the Sorting, so it fills out the ranks of Slytherin with
anyone who <i>isn't</i> repelled by all the hatred. So instead of
Padma Patil, Slytherin gets Pansy Parkinson. She's not very
cunning, and she's not very ambitious, but she's the sort of person
who doesn't mind what Slytherin is turning into. And the more
Padmas go to Ravenclaw and the more Pansies go to Slytherin, the
more the process accelerates. <i>It's destroying Slytherin House,
Draco!</i>"</p>
<p>It had a ring of awful truth, Padma <i>had</i> belonged in
Slytherin... and instead Slytherin got Pansy... Father rallied
lesser families like the Parkinsons because they were convenient
sources of support, but Father hadn't realized the
<i>consequences</i> of associating Slytherin's name with
them...</p>
<p>"I can't -" Draco said, but he wasn't even sure what he couldn't
do - "What do you <i>want</i> from me?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure how to heal Slytherin House," Harry said slowly.
"But I know it's something you and I will end up having to do. It
took centuries for science to dawn over the Muggle world, it only
happened slowly, but the stronger science got, the further that
sort of hatred retreated." Harry's voice was quiet, now. "I don't
know exactly why it worked that way, but that's how it happened
historically. As though there's something in science like the shine
of the Patronus Charm, driving back all sorts of darkness and
madness, not right away, but it seems to follow wherever science
goes. The Enlightenment, that was what it was called in the Muggle
world. It has something to do with seeking the truth, I think...
with being able to change your mind from what you grew up
believing... with thinking <i>logically,</i> realizing that there's
no <i>reason</i> to hate someone because their skin is a different
color, just like there's no reason to hate Hermione Granger... or
maybe there's something to it that even I don't understand. But the
Enlightenment is something that you and I belong to now, both of
us. Fixing Slytherin House is just one of the things we have to
do."</p>
<p>"Let me think," Draco said, his voice coming out in something of
a croak, "please," and he rested his head in his hands, and
thought.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco thought for a while, with his palms over his eyes to shut
out the world, no sound but his and Harry's breathing. All the
persuasive reasonableness of what Harry said, the evident grains of
truth that it contained; and against that, the obvious, the
perfectly and entirely obvious hypothesis about what was
<i>really</i> going on...</p>
<p>After a time, Draco finally raised his head.</p>
<p>"It sounds right," Draco said quietly.</p>
<p>A huge smile broke out on Harry's face.</p>
<p>"So," Draco continued, "is this where you bring me to
Dumbledore, to make it official?"</p>
<p>He kept his voice very casual as he said it.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Harry said. "That was the thing I was going to ask
you about, actually -"</p>
<p>Draco's blood froze in his veins, froze solid and shattered
-</p>
<p>"Professor Quirrell said something to me that got me thinking,
and, well, no matter how you answer this question, I'm already
stupid for having not asked you a lot earlier. Everyone in
Gryffindor thinks Dumbledore is a saint, the Hufflepuffs think he's
crazy, the Ravenclaws are all proud of themselves for having worked
out that he's only pretending to be crazy, but I never asked anyone
in Slytherin. I'm supposed to know better than to make that sort of
mistake. But if even <i>you</i> think Dumbledore's okay to conspire
with on fixing Slytherin House, I guess I didn't miss anything
important."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"You know," Draco said, his voice remarkably calm, all things
considered, "every time I wonder if you do things like this just to
annoy me, I tell myself that it <i>has</i> to be accidental, <i>no
one</i> could possibly do this sort of thing on purpose even if
they tried until blood trickled out of their ears. That's the only
reason I'm not going to strangle you now."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>And then strangle <i>himself,</i> because Harry <i>had</i> grown
up with Muggles, and then Dumbledore had smoothly diverted him from
Slytherin to Ravenclaw, so it was perfectly plausible that Harry
might <i>not</i> know anything, and Draco had never thought to
<i>tell him.</i></p>
<p>Or else Harry had guessed that Draco wouldn't join up with
Dumbledore so readily, and this itself was just the next step of
Dumbledore's plan...</p>
<p>But if Harry <i>really</i> didn't know about Dumbledore, then
warning him had to take precedence over <i>everything.</i></p>
<p>"All right," Draco said, after he'd had a chance to organize his
thoughts. "I don't know where to start, so I'll just start
somewhere." Draco drew a deep breath. This was going to take a
while. "Dumbledore murdered his little sister, and got away with it
because his brother wouldn't testify against him -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry listened with increasing worry and dismay. Harry had been
prepared, he'd thought, to take the blood purist side of the story
with a grain of salt. The trouble was that even after you added an
enormous amount of salt, it <i>still</i> didn't sound good.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's father had been convicted of using Unforgivable
Curses on children, and died in Azkaban. That was no sin of
Dumbledore's, but it would be a matter of public record. Harry
could check that part, and see whether all of this had been made up
out of thin air by the blood purists.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's mother had died mysteriously, shortly before his
younger sister died in what the Aurors had ruled to be murder.
Supposedly that sister had been brutalized by Muggles and never
spoken again after that; which, Draco pointed out, sounded
remarkably like a botched Obliviation.</p>
<p>After Harry's first few interruptions, Draco had seemed to pick
up on the general principle, and was now presenting the
observations first and the inferences afterward.</p>
<p>"- so you don't have to take my word for it," said Draco, "you
can <i>see</i> it, right? Anyone in Slytherin can. Dumbledore
waited to fight his duel with Grindelwald until the exact moment
when it would look best for Dumbledore, <i>after</i> Grindelwald
had ruined most of Europe and built up a reputation as the most
terrible Dark Wizard in history, and just when Grindelwald had lost
the gold and blood sacrifices he was getting from his Muggle pawns
and was about to start heading downhill. If Dumbledore was really
the noble wizard he pretended to be, he'd have fought Grindelwald
long before that. Dumbledore probably <i>wanted</i> Europe ruined,
it was probably part of their plan together, he only attacked
Grindelwald after his puppet <i>failed</i> him. And that big flashy
duel wasn't real, there's no way two wizards would be so exactly
matched that they'd fight for twenty whole hours until one of them
fell over from exhaustion, that was just Dumbledore making it look
more spectacular." Here Draco's voice became more indignant. "And
that got Dumbledore made <i>Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot!</i>
The Line of Merlin Unbroken, corrupted after fifteen hundred years!
And <i>then</i> he became Supreme Mugwump on top of that, and he
<i>already</i> had Hogwarts to use as an invincible fortress -
Headmaster <i>and</i> Chief Warlock <i>and</i> Supreme Mugwump, no
normal person would try to do all that at once, <i>how can anyone
not see that Dumbledore's trying to take over the world?</i>"</p>
<p>"Pause," Harry said, and closed his eyes to think.</p>
<p>It wasn't any worse than what you would have heard about the
West in Stalin's Russia, and none of that would have been true.
Though the blood purists wouldn't be able to get away with making
stuff up entirely... or would they? The <i>Daily Prophet</i> had
shown a pronounced tendency to make stuff up... but then again,
when they stuck out their neck too far on the Weasley betrothal,
they <i>had</i> been called on it and they <i>had</i> been
embarrassed...</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes, and saw that Draco was watching him with
a steady, waiting gaze.</p>
<p>"So when you asked me if it was time to join up with Dumbledore,
that was just a test."</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"And before that, when you said it sounded right -"</p>
<p>"It <i>sounds</i> right," said Draco. "But I don't know if I can
trust you. Are you going to complain about my <i>testing</i> you,
Mr. Potter? Are you going to say that I <i>fooled</i> you? That I
<i>led you on?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry knew he should smile like a good sport, but he couldn't
really, it was too much of a disappointment.</p>
<p>"You're right, it's fair, I can't complain," Harry said instead.
"So what about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? Not as bad as he was made
out to be?"</p>
<p>Draco looked bitter, at that. "So you think it's all just making
Father's side look good and Dumbledore's side look bad, and that I
believe it all myself just because Father told me."</p>
<p>"It's a possibility I'm considering," Harry said evenly.</p>
<p>Draco's voice was low and intense. "They <i>knew</i>. My father
knew, his friends knew. They <i>knew</i> the Dark Lord was evil.
<i>But he was the only chance anyone had against Dumbledore!</i>
The only wizard anywhere who was powerful enough to fight him! Some
of the other Death Eaters were truly evil too, like Bellatrix Black
- Father isn't like that - but Father and his friends <i>had</i> to
do it, Harry, they <i>had</i> to, Dumbledore was taking over
everything, the Dark Lord was the only hope anyone had left!"</p>
<p>Draco was staring hard at Harry. Harry met the gaze, trying to
think. Nobody ever thought of themselves as the villain of their
own story - maybe Lord Voldemort did, maybe Bellatrix did, but
Draco certainly didn't. That the Death Eaters were bad guys was not
in question. The question was whether they were <i>the</i> bad
guys; whether there was <i>one</i> villain in the story, or
<i>two...</i></p>
<p>"You're not convinced," Draco said. He looked worried, and a
little angry. Which didn't surprise Harry. He was pretty sure Draco
himself believed all this.</p>
<p>"<i>Should</i> I be convinced?" Harry said. He didn't look away.
"Just because you believe it? Are you a strong enough rationalist
now that your belief is strong evidence to me, because you'd be
very unlikely to believe it if it weren't true? When I met you, you
weren't that strong. Everything you told me, did you rethink it
after you awakened as a scientist, or is it just something you grew
up believing? Can you look me in the eyes and swear to me upon the
honor of House Malfoy that if there's one untruth buried in what
you said, one thing that got added on just to make Dumbledore look
a little worse, you would have noticed?"</p>
<p>Draco started to open his mouth, and Harry said, "Don't. Don't
stain the honor of House Malfoy. You're <i>not</i> that strong yet,
and you should know it. Listen, Draco, I've started to notice some
worrying things myself. But there's nothing <i>definite,</i>
nothing <i>certain,</i> it's all just deductions and hypotheses and
untrustworthy witnesses... And there's nothing certain in your
story, either. Dumbledore might've had some other good reason not
to fight Grindelwald years earlier - though it <i>would</i> have to
be a pretty good excuse, especially considering what was happening
on the Muggle side of things... but still. Is there one clearly
evil thing that Dumbledore's done for <i>certain,</i> so I don't
have to wonder?"</p>
<p>Draco's breathing was harsh. "All right," Draco said in an
uneven voice, "I'll tell you what Dumbledore did." From Draco's
robes came a wand, and Draco said "Quietus", then "Quietus" again,
but he got the pronunciation wrong a second time, and finally Harry
took out his own wand and did it.</p>
<p>"There," said Draco hoarsely, "once upon a time there, there was
a girl, and her name was Narcissa, and she was the prettiest, the
smartest, the most cunning girl that was ever Sorted into
Slytherin, and my father loved her, and they married, and she
wasn't a Death Eater, she wasn't a fighter, <i>all she ever did was
love Father -</i>" Draco stopped there, because he was crying.</p>
<p>Harry felt sick to his stomach. Draco had never talked about his
<i>mother</i>, not once, he should have noticed that earlier.
"She... got in the way of a curse?"</p>
<p>Draco's voice came out in a scream. "<i>Dumbledore burned her to
death in her own bedroom!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In a classroom filled with soft silver light, one boy is staring
at another boy, who is sobbing, wiping frantically at his eyes with
the sleeves of his robes.</p>
<p>It was hard for Harry to stay balanced, to keep withholding
judgment, it was too emotional, there was something that either
wanted to start tears from his own eyes in sympathy with Draco, or
<i>know</i> that it wasn't true...</p>
<p><i>Dumbledore burned her to death in her own bedroom!</i></p>
<p>That...</p>
<p>...didn't sound like Dumbledore's style...</p>
<p>...but you could only think that thought so many times, before
you started to wonder about the trustworthiness of that whole
'style' concept.</p>
<p>"It, it must have hurt horribly," Draco said, his voice shaking,
"Father never talks about it at all, you don't ever talk about it
in front of him, but Mr. Macnair told me, there were scorch marks
all over the bedroom, from how Mother must have struggled while
Dumbledore <i>burned her alive</i>. That is the debt Dumbledore
owes to House Malfoy and <i>we will have his life for it!</i>"</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, he let all of the hoarseness into his own
voice, it would be <i>wrong</i> to sound calm, "I'm sorry, I'm so
sorry for asking, but I <i>have</i> to know, <i>how</i> do you know
it was Dumble-"</p>
<p>"Dumbledore <i>said</i> he did it, he told Father it was a
<i>warning!</i> And Father couldn't testify under Veritaserum
because he was an Occlumens, he couldn't even get Dumbledore put on
trial, Father's own allies didn't believe him after Dumbledore just
denied everything in public, but we know, the Death Eaters know,
Father wouldn't have any reason to lie about that, Father would
want us to take revenge on the <i>right person,</i> can't you see
that Harry?" Draco's voice was wild.</p>
<p><i>Unless Lucius did it himself, of course, and found it more
convenient to blame Dumbledore.</i></p>
<p>Although... it also didn't seem like <i>Lucius's</i> style. And
if he <i>had</i> murdered Narcissa, it would have been smarter to
pin the blame on an easier victim instead of losing political
capital and credibility by going after Dumbledore...</p>
<p>In time, Draco stopped crying, and looked at Harry.
"<i>Well?</i>" said Draco, sounding like he wanted to spit the
words. "Is that <i>evil</i> enough for you, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry looked down at where his arms rested on the back of his
chair. He couldn't meet Draco's eyes any more, the pain in them was
too raw. "I wasn't expecting to hear that," Harry said softly. "I
don't know what to think any more."</p>
<p>"You <i>don't know?</i>" Draco's voice rose to a shriek, and he
stood up abruptly from his desk -</p>
<p>"I remembered the Dark Lord killing my parents," Harry said.
"When I went in front of the Dementor the first time, that was what
I remembered, the worst memory. Even though it was so long ago. I
heard them dying. My mother begged the Dark Lord not to kill me,
<i>not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!</i> That's what
she said. And the Dark Lord mocked her, and laughed. Then, I
remember, the flash of green light -"</p>
<p>Harry looked up at Draco.</p>
<p>"So we could fight," Harry said, "we could just keep on with the
same fight. You could tell me that it was right for my mother to
die, because she was the wife of James, who killed a Death Eater.
But bad for <i>your</i> mother to die, because <i>she</i> was
innocent. And I could tell you that it was right for your mother to
die, that Dumbledore must have had some <i>reason</i> that made it
<i>okay</i> to burn her alive in her own bedroom; but bad for
<i>my</i> mother to die. But you know, Draco, either way, wouldn't
it be <i>obvious</i> that we were just being biased? Because the
rule that says that it's wrong to kill innocent people, that rule
can't switch on for my mother and off for yours, and it can't
switch on for your mother and off for mine. If you tell me that
Lily was an enemy of the Death Eaters and it's right to kill your
enemies, then the same rule says that Dumbledore was right to kill
Narcissa, since she was <i>his</i> enemy." Harry's voice went
hoarse. "So if the two of us are going to agree on anything, it's
going to be that <i>neither</i> of their deaths were right and that
<i>no one's</i> mother should die any more."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The fury boiling inside Draco was so great that he could barely
stop himself from storming out of the room; all that halted him was
the recognition of a critical moment; and a small remnant of
friendship, a tiny flash of sympathy, for he had forgotten, he'd
<i>forgotten,</i> that Harry's mother <i>and</i> father were dead
by the Dark Lord's hand.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"You can talk," Harry said, "Draco, talk to me, I won't get
angry - are you thinking, I don't know, that Narcissa dying was
much worse than Lily dying? That it's wrong for me even to make the
comparison?"</p>
<p>"I guess I was stupid too," Draco said. "All this time, all this
time I forgot that you must hate the Death Eaters for killing your
parents, hate Death Eaters the way I hate Dumbledore." And Harry
had never said anything, never reacted when Draco talked about
Death Eaters, kept it <i>hidden</i> - Draco was a fool.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. "It's not - it's not like that, Draco, I, I
don't even know how to explain to you, except to say that a thought
like that, wouldn't," Harry's voice choked, "you wouldn't ever be
able to use it, to cast the Patronus Charm..."</p>
<p>Draco felt a sudden wrench in his heart, unwanted but he felt
it. "Are you pretending you're just going to <i>forget</i> about
your own parents? Are you saying I should just <i>forget</i> about
Mother?"</p>
<p>"So you and I <i>have</i> to be enemies then?" Now Harry's voice
was growing equally wild. "What have <i>we</i> ever done to <i>each
other</i> that means we have to be enemies? I refuse to be trapped
like that! Justice can't mean that <i>both</i> of us should attack
<i>each other,</i> it doesn't make sense!" Harry stopped, took a
deep breath, ran his fingers back through the deliberate mess of
his hair - the fingers came away sweaty, Draco could see it.
"Draco, listen, we can't expect to meet on everything right away,
you and I. So I won't ask you to say that the Dark Lord was
<i>wrong</i> to kill my mother, just say that it was... <i>sad</i>.
We won't talk about whether or not it was <i>necessary</i>, whether
it was <i>justified</i>. I'll just ask you to say that it was sad
that it happened, that my mother's life was valuable too, you'll
just say that for now. And I'll say it was sad that Narcissa died,
because her life was also worth something. We can't expect to agree
on everything right away, but if we start out by saying that every
life is precious, that it's sad when <i>anyone</i> dies, then I
know we'll meet someday. That's what I want you to say. Not who was
right. Not who was wrong. Just that it was sad when your mother
died, and sad when my mother died, and it would be sad if Hermione
Granger died, every life is precious, can we agree on that and let
the rest go by for now, is it enough if we just agree on that? Can
we, Draco? That seems... more like a thought someone could use to
cast the Patronus Charm."</p>
<p>There were tears in Harry's eyes.</p>
<p>And Draco was getting angry again. "Dumbledore <i>killed</i>
Mother, it's not enough to just say it's <i>sad!</i> I don't
understand what you think <i>you</i> have to do, but the Malfoys
<i>have</i> to take revenge!" Not avenging the deaths of family
went <i>beyond</i> weakness, beyond dishonor, you might as well not
<i>exist.</i></p>
<p>"I'm not arguing with that," Harry said quietly. "But will you
say that Lily Potter's death was sad? Just say that one thing?"</p>
<p>"That's..." Draco was having difficulty finding words again. "I
know, I know how you feel, but don't you see Harry, even if I just
say that Lily Potter's death was <i>sad,</i> that's <i>already</i>
going against the Death Eaters!"</p>
<p>"Draco, you've <i>got</i> to be able to say the Death Eaters
were wrong about some things! You <i>have</i> to, you can't
progress as a scientist otherwise, there'll be a roadblock in your
way, an authority you can't contradict. Not every change is an
improvement, but every improvement is a change, you can't do
anything <i>better</i> unless you can manage to do it
<i>differently</i>, <i>you've got to let yourself do better than
other people!</i> Even your father, Draco, even him. You've got to
be able to point to something your father did and say it was
mistaken, because he wasn't <i>perfect</i>, and if you can't say
that, you can't do better."</p>
<p>Father had warned him, every night before he went to sleep for a
month before he went to Hogwarts, that there would be people with
this goal.</p>
<p>"You're trying to break me loose of Father."</p>
<p>"Trying to break a <i>part</i> of you loose," said Harry.
"Trying to let you fix some things your father got mistaken. Trying
to let you <i>do better</i>. But not... trying to break your
<i>Patronus!</i>" Harry's voice got softer. "I wouldn't want to
break something bright like that. Who knows, fixing Slytherin House
might need <i>that</i>, too..."</p>
<p>It was getting to Draco, that was the thing, despite everything
it was getting to him, you had to be really careful around Harry
because his arguments sounded so convincing <i>even when he was
wrong.</i> "And what you're <i>not</i> admitting is that Dumbledore
told you that you could avenge your parents' deaths by taking Lord
Malfoy's son from him -"</p>
<p>"<i>No.</i> No. That part's just wrong." Harry took a deep
breath. "I did not know who Dumbledore was, or who the Dark Lord
was, or who the Death Eaters were, or how my parents died, until
three days before I came to Hogwarts. The day you and I first met
in the clothes shop, that was the day I learned. And Dumbledore
doesn't even <i>like</i> Muggle science, or he says he doesn't, I
got a chance to probe him on it once. The thought of taking revenge
on the Death Eaters through you has <i>never</i> crossed my mind,
not even <i>once</i> until now. I didn't know who the Malfoys were
when I met you in the clothes shop, and then I <i>liked</i>
you."</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>"I wish I could trust you," Draco said. His voice was shaking.
"If I could just <i>know</i> you were telling the truth, everything
would be so much simpler -"</p>
<p>And then suddenly it came to Draco.</p>
<p>The way to know whether Harry Potter really meant everything he
said, about wanting to fix Slytherin House, about being sad that
Mother had died.</p>
<p>It would be illegal, and since he'd have to do it without
Father's help, it would be <i>dangerous</i>, he couldn't even trust
Harry Potter to <i>help,</i> but...</p>
<p>"All right," Draco said. "I've thought of a definitive
experiment."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I want to give you a drop of Veritaserum," Draco said. "Just
one drop, so you can't lie, but not enough to <i>make</i> you
answer anything. I don't know where I'll get it, but I'll make
<i>certain</i> it's safe -"</p>
<p>"Um," Harry said. There was a helpless look on his face. "Draco,
um -"</p>
<p>"Don't say it," Draco said. His voice was firm and calm. "If you
say no, that's my experimental result right there."</p>
<p>"Draco, I'm an Occlumens -"</p>
<p>"<i>OH THAT IS SUCH A LIE -</i>"</p>
<p>"I was trained by Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set it up.
Look, Draco, I'll <i>take</i> one drop of Veritaserum if you can
get it, I'm just <i>warning</i> you that I'm an Occlumens. Not a
perfect Occlumens, but Mr. Bester said I was putting up a complete
block, and I could probably beat Veritaserum."</p>
<p>"<i>You're in your first year at Hogwarts! That's just
crazy!</i>"</p>
<p>"Know a Legilimens you can trust? I'll be happy to demonstrate -
look, Draco, I'm sorry, but doesn't the fact that I <i>told</i> you
count for something? I <i>could</i> have just let you do it, you
know."</p>
<p>"<i>WHY? Why are you always like this, Harry? Why do you have to
mess everything up even when it's IMPOSSIBLE? And stop smiling,
this isn't funny!</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I <i>know</i> it's not funny, I -"</p>
<p>It took a while for Draco to get himself under control.</p>
<p>But Harry was right. Harry <i>could</i> have just let Draco
administer the Veritaserum. <i>If</i> he really was an Occlumens...
Draco didn't know who he could ask to try Legilimency, but he could
at least ask Professor Quirrell if it was true... Could Draco trust
<i>Professor Quirrell?</i> Maybe Professor Quirrell would just say
anything Harry asked him to.</p>
<p>Then Draco remembered the other thing Harry had told him to ask
Professor Quirrell, and thought of a different test.</p>
<p>"You <i>know</i>," said Draco. "You <i>know</i> what it costs
me, if I agree that the poison in Slytherin's House is hating
Muggleborns, and say that Lily Potter's death was sad. And that's
<i>part of your plan,</i> don't tell me it's not."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing, which was wise of him.</p>
<p>"There's something I want from you in return," said Draco. "And
before then, an experimental test I want to try -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Draco pushed open the door to which the portraits had directed
them, and this time it was the right door. Before them was a small
empty place of stone set against the night sky. Not a roof like the
one he'd dropped Harry from, but a tiny and proper courtyard, far
above the ground. With proper railings, elaborate traceries of
stone that flushed seamlessly into the stone floor... How so much
<i>artistry</i> had been infused into the creation of Hogwarts was
something that still awed Draco every time he thought about it.
There must have been some way to do it all at once, no one could
have detailed so much piece by piece, the castle <i>changed</i> and
every new piece was like that. It was so far beyond the wizardry of
these fading days that no one would have believed it if they hadn't
seen the proof in Hogwarts itself.</p>
<p>Cloudless and cold, the winter night sky; it got dark long
before students' curfew, in the final days of January.</p>
<p>The stars shining brightly, in the clear air.</p>
<p>Harry had said that being under the stars would help him.</p>
<p>Draco touched his chest with his wand, slid his fingers in a
practiced motion, and said, "<i>Thermos.</i>" A warmth spread
through him, starting from his heart; the wind went on blowing on
his face, but he was no longer cold.</p>
<p>"<i>Thermos,</i>" Harry's voice said behind him.</p>
<p>They went together to the railing, to look down at the ground a
long way below. Draco tried to figure if they were in one of the
towers that could be seen from outside, and found that right now he
couldn't quite seem to picture how Hogwarts looked from outside.
But the ground below was always the same; he could see the
Forbidden Forest as a vague outline, and moonlight glittering from
the Hogwarts Lake.</p>
<p>"You know," Harry's voice said quietly from beside him where his
arms leaned on the railing next to Draco's, "one of the things that
Muggles get really wrong, is that they don't turn all their lights
out at night. Not even for one hour every month, not even for
fifteen minutes once a year. The photons scatter in the atmosphere
and wash out all but the brightest stars, and the night sky doesn't
look the same at all, not unless you go far away from any cities.
Once you've looked up at the sky over Hogwarts, it's hard to
imagine living in a Muggle city, where you wouldn't be able to see
the stars. You certainly wouldn't want to spend your whole life in
Muggle cities, once you'd seen the night sky over Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Draco glanced at Harry, and found that Harry was craning his
neck to stare up at where the Milky Way arched across the
darkness.</p>
<p>"Of course," Harry went on, his voice still quiet, "you can't
ever see the stars properly from <i>Earth,</i> either, the air
always gets in the way. You have to look from somewhere else, if
you want to see the real thing, the stars burning hard and bright,
like their true selves. Have you ever wished that you could just
whisk yourself up into the night sky, Draco, and go look at what
there is to see around other Suns than ours? If there were no limit
to the power of your magic, is that one of the things you would do,
if you could do anything?"</p>
<p>There was a silence, and then Draco realized that he was
expected to answer. "I didn't think of it before," Draco said.
Without any conscious decision, his voice came out as soft and
hushed as Harry's. "Do you really think anyone would ever be able
to do that?"</p>
<p>"I don't think it'll be that easy," said Harry. "But I know I
don't mean to spend my whole life on Earth."</p>
<p>It would have been something to laugh at, if Draco hadn't known
that some Muggles had already left, without even using magic.</p>
<p>"To pass your test," Harry said, "I'm going to have to say what
it means to <i>me,</i> that thought, the whole thing, not the
shorter version I tried to explain to you before. But you should be
able to see it's the same idea, only more general. So <i>my</i>
version of the thought, Draco, is that when we go out into the
stars, we might find other people there. And if so, they certainly
won't look like we do. There might be things out there that are
grown from crystal, or big pulsating blobs... or they might be made
of magic, now that I think about it. So with all that strangeness,
how do you recognize a <i>person?</i> Not by the shape, not by how
many arms or legs it has. Not by the sort of substance it's made
out of, whether that's flesh or crystal or stuff I can't imagine.
You would have to recognize them as people from their <i>minds</i>.
And even their minds wouldn't work just like ours do. But anything
that lives and thinks and knows itself and doesn't want to die,
it's sad, Draco, it's sad if that person has to die, because it
doesn't want to. Compared to what might be out there, every human
being who ever lived, we're all like brothers and sisters, you
could hardly even tell us apart. The ones out there who met
<i>us,</i> they wouldn't see British or French, they wouldn't be
able to tell the difference, they'd just see a human being. Humans
who can love, and hate, and laugh, and cry; and to <i>them</i>, the
ones out there, that would make us all as alike as peas in the same
pod. <i>They</i> would be different, though. <i>Really</i>
different. But that wouldn't stop us, and it wouldn't stop them, if
we both wanted to be friends together."</p>
<p>Harry raised his wand then, and Draco turned, and looked away,
as he had promised; looked toward the stone floor and stone wall in
which the door was set. For Draco had promised not to look, and not
to tell anyone of what Harry had said, or anything at all of what
happened here this night, though he didn't know why it was to be so
secret.</p>
<p>"I have a dream," said Harry's voice, "that one day sentient
beings will be judged by the patterns of their minds, and not their
color or their shape or the stuff they're made of, or who their
parents were. Because if we can get along with crystal things
someday, how silly would it be not to get along with Muggleborns,
who are shaped like us, and think like us, as alike to us as peas
in a pod? The crystal things wouldn't even be able to tell the
difference. How impossible is it to imagine that the hatred
poisoning Slytherin House would be worth taking with us to the
stars? Every life is precious, everything that thinks and knows
itself and doesn't want to die. Lily Potter's life was precious,
and Narcissa Malfoy's life was precious, even though it's too late
for them now, it was sad when they died. But there are other lives
that are still alive to be fought for. Your life, and my life, and
Hermione Granger's life, all the lives of Earth, and all the lives
beyond, to be defended and protected, <i>EXPECTO
PATRONUM!</i>"</p>
<p>And there was light.</p>
<p>Everything turned to silver in that light, the stone floor, the
stone wall, the door, the railings, so dazzling just in the
reflection that you could hardly even see them, even the air seemed
to shine, and the light grew brighter, and brighter, and brighter
-</p>
<p>When the light ended it was like a shock, Draco's hand went
automatically to his robe to bring out a handkerchief, and it was
only then that he realized he was crying.</p>
<p>"There is your experimental result," Harry's voice said quietly.
"I really did mean it, that thought."</p>
<p>Draco slowly turned toward Harry, who had lowered his wand
now.</p>
<p>"That, that's got to be a trick, right?" Draco said. He couldn't
take many more of these shocks. "Your Patronus - can't
<i>really</i> be that bright -" And yet it <i>had</i> been Patronus
light, once you knew what you were looking at, you couldn't mistake
it for anything else.</p>
<p>"That was the <i>true</i> form of the Patronus Charm," Harry
said. "Something that lets you put all your strength into the
Patronus, without hindrance from within yourself. And before you
ask, I did not learn it from Dumbledore. He does not know the
secret, and could not cast the true form if he did. I solved the
puzzle for myself. And I knew, once I understood, that this spell
must not be spoken of. For your sake, I undertook your test; but
you must not speak of it, Draco."</p>
<p>Draco didn't know any more, he didn't know where the true
strength lay, or the right of things. Double vision, double vision.
Draco wanted to call Harry's ideals weakness, Hufflepuff
foolishness, the sort of lie that rulers told to placate the
populace and that Harry had been silly enough to believe for
himself, foolishness taken seriously and raised up to insane
heights, projected out onto the stars themselves -</p>
<p>Something beautiful and hidden, mysterious and bright -</p>
<p>"Will I," whispered Draco, "be able to cast a Patronus like
that, someday?"</p>
<p>"If you always keep seeking the truth," Harry said, "and if you
don't refuse the warm thoughts when you find them, then I'm sure
you will. I think a person could get anywhere if they just kept
going long enough, even to the stars."</p>
<p>Draco wiped his eyes with his handkerchief again.</p>
<p>"We should go back inside," Draco said in an unsteady voice,
"someone could've seen it, all that light -"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and moved to and through the door; and Draco
looked up at the night sky one last time before he followed.</p>
<p>Who <i>was</i> the Boy-Who-Lived, that he was already an
Occlumens, and could cast the true form of the Patronus Charm, and
do other strange things? What was Harry's Patronus, why must it
stay unseen?</p>
<p>Draco didn't ask any of those questions, because Harry might
have <i>answered</i>, and Draco just couldn't take any more shocks
today. He just <i>couldn't</i>. One more shock and his head was
going to just fall right off his shoulders and go bounce, bounce,
bounce down the corridors of Hogwarts.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>They'd ducked into a small alcove, instead of going all the way
back to the classroom, at Draco's request; he was feeling too
nervous to put it off any longer.</p>
<p>Draco put up a Quieting barrier, and then looked at Harry in
silent question.</p>
<p>"I've been thinking about it," Harry said. "I'll do it, but
there are five conditions -"</p>
<p>"<i>Five?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes, five. Look, Draco, a pledge like this is just
<i>begging</i> to go terribly wrong somehow, you <i>know</i> it
would go wrong if this were a play -"</p>
<p>"Well, it's not!" Draco said. "Dumbledore killed Mother. He's
evil. It's one of those things you talk about that <i>doesn't</i>
have to be complicated."</p>
<p>"Draco," Harry said, his voice careful, "all I <i>know</i> is
that <i>you</i> say that <i>Lucius</i> says that <i>Dumbledore</i>
says he killed Narcissa. To believe that unquestioningly, I have to
trust you <i>and</i> Lucius <i>and</i> Dumbledore. So like I said,
there are conditions. The first one is that at any point <i>you</i>
can release me from the pledge, if it no longer seems like a good
idea. It has to be a deliberate and intended decision on your part,
of course, not a trick of wording or something."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Draco. That sounded safe enough.</p>
<p>"Condition two is that I'm pledging to take as an enemy whoever
actually did kill Narcissa, as determined to the honest best of my
ability as a rationalist. Whether that's Dumbledore, or someone
else. And you have my word that I'll exercise my best ability as a
rationalist to keep that judgment honest, as a question of simple
fact. Agreed?"</p>
<p>"I don't like it," said Draco. He didn't, the whole point was to
make sure Harry never went with Dumbledore. Still, if Harry
<i>was</i> honest, he'd catch on to Dumbledore soon enough; and if
dishonest, he'd already broken his word... "But I'll agree."</p>
<p>"Condition three is that Narcissa has to have been <i>burned
alive</i>. If that part of the story turns out to be something
exaggerated just to make it sound a little worse, then I get to
decide for myself whether or not to still go through with the
pledge. Good people sometimes have to kill. But they don't ever
torture people to death. It's because Narcissa was <i>burned
alive</i> that I know whoever did that was evil."</p>
<p>Draco kept his temper, barely.</p>
<p>"Condition four is that if Narcissa got her own hands dirty,
and, say, <i>Crucioed</i> someone's child into insanity, and that
person burned Narcissa for revenge, the deal might be off again.
Because then it was still wrong for them to burn her, they still
should've just killed her without pain; but it wasn't <i>evil</i>
the same way as if she was just Lucius's love who never did
anything herself, like you said. Condition five is that if whoever
killed Narcissa was tricked somehow into doing it, then my enemy is
whoever tricked them, not the person who was tricked."</p>
<p>"All this <i>really</i> sounds like you're planning to weasel
out of it -"</p>
<p>"Draco, I won't take a good person as an enemy, not for you or
anyone. I have to really believe they're in the wrong. But I've
thought about it, and it seems to me that if Narcissa didn't do any
evil with her own hands, just fell in love with Lucius and chose to
stay his wife, then whoever burned her alive in her own bedroom
isn't likely to be a good guy. And I'll pledge to take as my enemy
whoever made that happen, whether it's Dumbledore or anyone else,
unless you deliberately release me from that pledge. Hopefully
<i>that</i> won't go wrong the way it would if this were a
play."</p>
<p>"I'm not happy," said Draco. "But okay. You pledge to take my
mother's murderer as your enemy, and I'll -"</p>
<p>Harry waited, with a patient look on his face, while Draco tried
to make his voice work again.</p>
<p>"I'll help you fix the problem with Slytherin House hating
Muggleborns," Draco finished in a whisper. "And I'll say it was sad
that Lily Potter died."</p>
<p>"So be it," said Harry.</p>
<p>And it was done.</p>
<p>The break, Draco knew, had just widened a little more. No, not a
little, a <i>lot.</i> There was a sensation of drifting away, of
being lost, further and further from shore, further and further
from home...</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Draco said. He turned away from Harry, and then
tried to calm himself, he had to do this test, and he didn't want
to fail it from being nervous or ashamed.</p>
<p>Draco raised his wand into the starting position for the
Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>Remembered falling from his broomstick, the pain, the fear,
imagined it coming from a tall figure in a cloak, looking like a
dead thing left in water.</p>
<p>And then Draco closed his eyes, the better to remember Father
holding his small, cold hands in his own warm strength.</p>
<p><i>Don't be frightened, my son, I'm here...</i></p>
<p>The wand swung up in a broad brandish, to drive the fear away,
and Draco was surprised at the strength of it; and he remembered in
that moment that <i>Father</i> wasn't lost, would never be lost,
would always be there and strong in his own person, no matter what
happened to Draco, and his voice cried, <i>"Expecto
Patronum!"</i></p>
<p>Draco opened his eyes.</p>
<p>A shining snake looked back at him, no less bright than
before.</p>
<p>Behind him, he heard <i>Harry</i> exhale a breath, as though in
relief.</p>
<p>Draco gazed into the white light. It seemed he wasn't lost
completely, after all.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," said Harry after a while. "Can we test my
hypothesis about how to use a Patronus to send messages?"</p>
<p>"Is it going to surprise me?" said Draco. "I don't want any more
surprises today."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry had claimed that the idea wasn't all that strange and he
didn't see how it could possibly shock Draco in any way, which made
Draco feel even more nervous, somehow; but Draco could see how
important it was to have a way of sending messages in
emergencies.</p>
<p>The trick - or so Harry hypothesized - was wanting to spread the
good news, wanting the recipient to know the truth of whatever
happy thought you'd used to cast the Patronus Charm. Only instead
of telling the recipient in words, the Patronus itself was the
message. By wanting them to see that, the Patronus would go to
them.</p>
<p>"Tell Harry," said Draco to the luminous snake, even though
Harry was standing only a few paces away on the other side of the
room, "to, um, beware the green monkey," this being a sign from a
play Draco had once seen.</p>
<p>And then, just like at King's Cross station, Draco wanted Harry
to know that Father had always cared for him; only this time he
didn't try to say it in words, but wanted to say it with the happy
thought itself.</p>
<p>The bright snake slithered across the room, looking more like it
was slithering through the air rather than the stone itself; it got
to Harry after traveling that short distance -</p>
<p>- and said to Harry, in a strange voice that Draco recognized as
how he himself probably sounded to other people, "Beware the green
monkey."</p>
<p>"<i>Hsssss ssss sshsshssss,</i>" said Harry.</p>
<p>The snake slithered back across the floor to Draco.</p>
<p>"Harry says the message is received and acknowledged," said the
shining Blue Krait in Draco's voice.</p>
<p>"Huh," Harry said. "Talking to Patronuses feels odd."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me like that?" said the Heir of
Slytherin.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>Harry stared at Draco.</p>
<p>"You mean just <i>magical</i> snakes, right?"</p>
<p>"N-no," said Draco. He was looking rather pale, and was still
stammering, but had at least stopped the incoherent noises he'd
been making earlier. "You're a Parselmouth, you can speak
Parseltongue, it's the language of all snakes everywhere. You can
understand any snake when it talks, and they can understand when
you talk to them... Harry, you can't <i>possibly</i> believe you
were Sorted into Ravenclaw! <i>You're the Heir of
Slytherin!</i>"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"SNAKES ARE SENTIENT?"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="48">Chapter 48</h2><h3>Utilitarian
Priorities</h3>
<p>It was Saturday, the first morning of February, and at the
Ravenclaw table, a boy bearing a breakfast plate heaped high with
vegetables was nervously inspecting his servings for the slightest
trace of meat.</p>
<p>It <i>might</i> have been an overreaction. After he'd gotten
over the raw shock, Harry's common sense had woken up and
hypothesized that "Parseltongue" was probably just a linguistic
user interface for controlling snakes...</p>
<p>...after all, snakes couldn't <i>really</i> be human-level
intelligent, <i>someone</i> would have noticed by now. The
smallest-brained creatures Harry had ever heard of with anything
like linguistic ability were the African grey parrots taught by
Irene Pepperberg. And that was unstructured protolanguage, in a
species that played complex games of adultery and needed to model
other parrots. While according to what Draco had been able to
remember, snakes spoke to Parselmouths in what sounded like normal
human language - i.e., full-blown recursive syntactical grammar.
That had taken <i>time</i> for hominids to evolve, with huge brains
and strong social selection pressures. Snakes didn't have much
society at all that Harry had ever heard. And with thousands upon
thousands of different species of snakes all over the world, how
could they all use the <i>same</i> version of their supposed
language, "Parseltongue"?</p>
<p>Of course that was all merely common sense, in which Harry was
starting to lose faith entirely.</p>
<p>But Harry was sure he'd heard snakes hissing on the TV at some
point - after all, he knew what that sounded like from
<i>somewhere</i> - and <i>that</i> hadn't sounded to him like
language, which had seemed a good deal more reassuring...</p>
<p>...at first. The problem was that Draco had also asserted that
Parselmouths could send snakes on extended complex missions. And if
that was true, then Parselmouths had to <i>make snakes persistently
intelligent</i> by talking to them. In the worst-case scenario that
would make the snake self-aware, like what Harry had accidentally
done to the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>And when Harry had offered <i>that</i> hypothesis, Draco had
claimed that he could remember a story - Harry hoped to Cthulhu
that <i>this one</i> story was just a fairy tale, it had that ring
to it, but there <i>was</i> a story - about Salazar Slytherin
sending a brave young viper on a mission to <i>gather information
from other snakes.</i></p>
<p>If any snake a Parselmouth had talked to, could make
<i>other</i> snakes self-aware by talking to <i>them,</i>
then...</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Harry didn't even know why his mind was going all "then...
then..." when he knew perfectly well how the exponential
progression would work, it was just the sheer moral horror of it
that was blowing his mind.</p>
<p>And what if someone had invented a spell like that to talk to
cows?</p>
<p>What if there were Poultrymouths?</p>
<p>Or for that matter...</p>
<p>Harry froze in sudden realization just as the forkful of carrots
was about to enter his mouth.</p>
<p><i>That couldn't, couldn't possibly be true, surely no wizard
would be stupid enough to do THAT...</i></p>
<p>And Harry knew, with a dreadful sinking feeling, that <i>of
course</i> they would be that stupid. Salazar Slytherin had
probably never considered the moral implications of snake
intelligence for even one second, just like it hadn't ever occurred
to Salazar that <i>Muggleborns</i> were intelligent enough to
deserve personhood rights. Most people just didn't see moral issues
at all unless someone else was pointing them out...</p>
<p>"Harry?" said Terry from beside him, sounding like he was afraid
he would regret asking. "Why are you staring at your fork like
that?"</p>
<p>"I'm starting to think magic should be illegal," said Harry. "By
the way, have you ever heard any stories about wizards who could
speak with plants?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Terry hadn't heard of anything like that.</p>
<p>Neither had any seventh-year Ravenclaws that Harry had
asked.</p>
<p>And now Harry had returned to his place, but not yet sat down
again, staring at his plate of vegetables with a forlorn
expression. He was getting hungrier, and later in the day he would
be visiting Mary's Place for one of their incredibly tasty
dishes... Harry was finding himself sorely tempted to just revert
back to yesterday's eating habits and be done with it.</p>
<p><i>You've got to eat something,</i> said his inner Slytherin.
<i>And it's not all that much</i> more <i>likely that anyone
sneezed self-awareness onto poultry than onto plants, so as long as
you're eating food of questionable sentience either way, why not
eat the delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices?</i></p>
<p><i>I'm not quite sure that's valid utilitarian logic, there
-</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, you want utilitarian logic? One serving of utilitarian
logic coming up: Even in the unlikely chance that some moron</i>
did <i>manage to confer sentience on chickens, it's</i> your
<i>research that stands the best chance of discovering the fact and
doing something about it. If you can complete your work even
slightly faster by</i> not <i>messing around with your diet, then,
counterintuitive as it may seem, the</i> best <i>thing you can do
to save the greatest number of possibly-sentient who-knows-whats
is</i> not <i>wasting time on wild guesses about what might be
intelligent. It's not like the house elves haven't prepared the
food already, regardless of what you take onto your plate.</i></p>
<p>Harry considered this for a moment. It was a rather seductive
line of reasoning -</p>
<p><i>Good!</i> said Slytherin. <i>I'm glad you see now that the
most moral thing to do is to sacrifice the lives of sentient beings
for your own convenience, to feed your dreadful appetites, for the
sick pleasure of ripping them apart with your teeth -</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i> Harry thought indignantly. <i>Which side are
you</i> on <i>here?</i></p>
<p>His inner Slytherin's mental voice was grim. <i>You too will
someday embrace the doctrine... that the end justifies the
meats.</i> This was followed by some mental snickering.</p>
<p>Ever since Harry had started worrying that plants might also be
sentient, his non-Ravenclaw components had been having trouble
taking his moral caution seriously. Hufflepuff was shouting
<i>Cannibalism!</i> every time Harry tried to think about any food
item whatsoever, and Gryffindor would visualize it screaming while
he ate it, even if it was, say, a sandwich -</p>
<p><i>Cannibalism!</i></p>
<p><i>AIIIEEEE DON'T EAT ME -</i></p>
<p><i>Ignore the screams, eat it anyway! It's a safe place to
compromise your ethics in the service of higher goals, everyone</i>
else <i>thinks it's okay to eat sandwiches so you can't use your
usual rationalization about a small probability of a large downside
if you get caught -</i></p>
<p>Harry gave a mental sigh, and thought, <i>Just so long as you're
okay with</i> us <i>being eaten by giant monsters that didn't do
enough research into whether</i> we <i>were sentient.</i></p>
<p><i>I'm okay with that,</i> said Slytherin. <i>Is everyone else
okay with that?</i> (Internal mental nods.) <i>Great, can we go
back to deep-fried Diracawl slices now?</i></p>
<p><i>Not until I've done some more research into what's sentient
and what isn't. Now shut up.</i> And Harry turned firmly away from
his plate full of oh-so-tempting vegetables to head toward the
library -</p>
<p><i>Just eat the students,</i> said Hufflepuff. <i>There's no
doubt about whether</i> they're <i>sentient.</i></p>
<p><i>You know you want to,</i> said Gryffindor. <i>I bet the young
ones are the tastiest.</i></p>
<p>Harry was starting to wonder if the Dementor had somehow damaged
their imaginary personalities.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Honestly</i>," said Hermione. The young girl's voice sounded
a little acerbic as her gaze scanned the bookshelves of the
Herbology stacks in the Hogwarts library. Harry had left her a
message asking if she could come to the library after she'd
finished breakfast, which Harry had skipped; but then when Harry
had introduced the day's topic she'd seemed a bit nonplussed. "You
know your problem, Harry? You've got no sense of priorities. An
idea gets into your head and you just go running straight off after
it."</p>
<p>"I've got a <i>great</i> sense of priorities," said Harry. His
hand reached out and grabbed <i>Vegetable Cunning</i> by Casey
McNamara, and began to flip through the starting pages, searching
for the table of contents. "That's why I want to find out whether
plants can talk <i>before</i> I eat my carrots."</p>
<p>"Don't you think that maybe the two of us have more
<i>important</i> things to worry about?"</p>
<p><i>You sound just like Draco,</i> Harry thought, but of course
didn't say out loud. Out loud he said, "What could <i>possibly</i>
be more important than plants turning out to be sentient?"</p>
<p>There was a pregnant silence from beside him, as Harry's eyes
went down the table of contents. There was indeed a chapter on
Plant Language, causing Harry's heart to skip a beat; and then his
hands began to rapidly turn the pages, heading for the appropriate
page number.</p>
<p>"There are days," said Hermione Granger, "when I really, truly,
have absolutely no idea what goes on inside that head of
yours."</p>
<p>"Look, it's a question of multiplication, okay? There's a
<i>lot</i> of plants in the world, if they're <i>not</i> sentient
then they're not important, but if plants <i>are</i> people then
they've got more moral weight than all the human beings in the
world put together. Now, of course your brain doesn't realize that
on an intuitive level, but that's because the brain can't multiply.
Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian households how
much they'll pay to save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two
hundred thousand birds from dying in oil ponds, the three groups
will respectively state that they're willing to pay seventy-eight,
eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference, in other words.
It's called scope insensitivity. Your brain imagines a single bird
struggling in an oil pond, and that image creates some amount of
emotion that determines your willingness to pay. But no one can
visualize even two thousand of anything, so the <i>quantity</i>
just gets thrown straight out the window. Now try to <i>correct</i>
that bias with respect to a <i>hundred trillion</i> sentient blades
of grass, and you'll realize that this could be thousands of times
more important than we used to think the whole human species was...
oh thank Azathoth, this says it's just a few magical plants that
can talk and they speak regular human language out loud, not that
there's a spell you can use to talk with <i>any</i> plant -"</p>
<p>"Ron came to me at breakfast yesterday morning," Hermione said.
Now her voice sounded a little quiet, a little sad, maybe even a
little scared. "He said he'd been dreadfully shocked to see me kiss
you. That what you said while you were Demented should've shown me
how much evil you were hiding inside. And that if I was going to be
a follower of a Dark Wizard, then he wasn't sure he wanted to be in
my army anymore."</p>
<p>Harry's hands had stopped turning pages. It seemed that Harry's
brain, for all its abstract knowledge, was still incapable of
appreciating scope on any real emotional level, because it had just
forcibly redirected his attention away from trillions of
possibly-sentient blades of grass who might be suffering or dying
even as they spoke, and toward the life of a single human being who
happened to be nearer and dearer.</p>
<p>"Ron is the world's most gigantic prat," Harry said. "They won't
be printing that in the newspaper anytime soon, because it's not
news. So after you fired him, how many of his arms and legs did you
break?"</p>
<p>"I tried to tell him it wasn't like that," Hermione went on in
the same quiet voice. "I tried to tell him <i>you</i> weren't like
that, and that it wasn't like that between the two of us, but it
just seemed to make him even more... more like he was."</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn't feeling
angrier at Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to
be overriding that, for now. "The more you try to justify yourself
to people like that, the more it acknowledges that they have the
<i>right</i> to question you. It shows you think they get to be
your inquisitor, and once you grant someone that sort of power over
you, they just push more and more." This was one of Draco Malfoy's
lessons which Harry had thought was actually pretty smart: people
who <i>tried</i> to defend themselves got questioned over every
little point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if
you made it clear from the start that you were a celebrity and
above social conventions, people's minds wouldn't bother tracking
most violations. "That's why when Ron came over to <i>me</i> as I
was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay away
from you, I held my hand out over the floor and said, 'You see how
high I'm holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this
high to talk to me.' Then he accused me of, quote, sucking you into
the darkness, unquote, so I pursed my lips and went
<i>schluuuuurp</i>, and after that his mouth was still making those
talking noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don't think he'll be
trying his lectures on me again."</p>
<p>"I understand why you did that," Hermione said, her voice tight,
"I <i>wanted</i> to tell him off too, but I really wish you hadn't,
it will make things harder for <i>me,</i> Harry!"</p>
<p>Harry looked up from <i>Vegetable Cunning</i> again, he wasn't
getting any reading done at this rate; and he saw that Hermione was
still reading whatever book she had, not looking up at him. Her
hands turned another page even as he watched.</p>
<p>"I think you're taking the wrong approach by trying to defend
yourself at all," Harry said. "I really do think that. You are who
you are. You're friends with whoever you choose. Tell anyone who
questions you to shove it."</p>
<p>Hermione just shook her head, and turned another page.</p>
<p>"Option two," Harry said. "Go to Fred and George and tell them
to have a little talk with their wayward brother, <i>those</i> two
are genuine good guys -"</p>
<p>"It's not just Ron," Hermione said in almost a whisper. "Lots of
people are saying it, Harry. Even Mandy is giving me worried looks
when she thinks I'm not looking. Isn't it funny? I keep worrying
that Professor Quirrell is sucking <i>you</i> into the darkness,
and now people are warning me just the same way I try to warn
you."</p>
<p>"Well, <i>yeah,</i>" said Harry. "Doesn't that reassure you a
bit about me and Professor Quirrell?"</p>
<p>"In a word," said Hermione, "no."</p>
<p>There was a silence that lasted long enough for Hermione to turn
another page, and then her voice, in a real whisper this time,
"And, and Padma is going around telling everyone that, that since I
couldn't cast the P-Patronus Charm, I must only be p-pretending to
be n-nice..."</p>
<p>"Padma didn't even <i>try</i> herself!" Harry said indignantly.
"If you <i>were</i> a Dark Witch who was just pretending, you
wouldn't have <i>tried</i> in front of everyone, do they think
you're <i>stupid?</i>"</p>
<p>Hermione smiled a little, and blinked a few times.</p>
<p>"Hey, <i>I</i> have to worry about <i>actually</i> going evil.
<i>Here</i> the worst case scenario is that people think you're
more evil than you really are. Is that going to kill you? I mean,
is it all <i>that</i> bad?"</p>
<p>The young girl nodded, her face screwed up tight.</p>
<p>"Look, Hermione... if you worry that much about what other
people think, if you're unhappy whenever other people don't picture
you exactly the same way you picture yourself, that's
<i>already</i> dooming yourself to always be unhappy. No one ever
thinks of us just the same way we think of ourselves."</p>
<p>"I don't know how to explain to you," Hermione said in a sad
soft voice. "I'm not sure it's something you could ever understand,
Harry. All I can think of to say is, how would you feel if <i>I</i>
thought you were evil?"</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry visualized it. "Yeah, that <i>would</i> hurt. A
lot. But you're a good person who thinks about that sort of thing
intelligently, you've <i>earned</i> that power over me, it would
<i>mean</i> something if you thought I'd gone wrong. I can't think
of a single other student, besides you, whose opinion I'd care
about the same way -"</p>
<p>"You can live like that," whispered Hermione Granger. "I
can't."</p>
<p>The girl had gone through another three pages in silence, and
Harry had returned his eyes to his own book and was trying to
regain his focus, when Hermione finally said, in a small voice,
"Are you really sure I mustn't know how to cast the Patronus
Charm?"</p>
<p>"I..." Harry had to swallow a sudden lump in his throat. He
suddenly saw himself <i>not</i> knowing why the Patronus Charm
didn't work for him, <i>not</i> being able to show Draco, just
being told that there was a reason, and nothing more. "Hermione,
your Patronus would shine with the same light but it wouldn't be
<i>normal,</i> it wouldn't look like people think Patronuses should
look, anyone who saw it would know there was something strange
going on. Even if I told you the secret you couldn't
<i>demonstrate</i> to anyone, unless you made them face the other
way so they could only see the light, and... and the most important
part of any secret is the knowledge that a secret exists, you could
only show one or two friends if you swore them to secrecy..."
Harry's voice trailed off helplessly.</p>
<p>"I'll take it." Her voice was still small.</p>
<p>It was very hard not to just blurt out the secret, right there
in the library.</p>
<p>"I, I shouldn't, I <i>really</i> shouldn't, it's
<i>dangerous,</i> Hermione, it could do a lot of harm if that
secret got out! Haven't you heard the saying, three can keep a
secret if two are dead? That telling just your closest friends is
the same as telling everyone, because you're not just trusting
them, you're trusting everyone they trust? It's too important, too
much of a risk, it's not the sort of decision that should be made
for the sake of fixing someone's reputation at school!"</p>
<p>"Okay," Hermione said. She closed the book and put it back on
the shelf. "I can't concentrate right now, Harry, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"If there's <i>anything</i> else I can do -"</p>
<p>"Be nicer to everyone."</p>
<p>The girl didn't look back as she walked out of the stacks, which
might have been a good thing, because the boy was frozen in place,
unmoving.</p>
<p>After a while, the boy started turning pages again.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="49">Chapter 49</h2><h3>Prior Information</h3>
<p>A boy waits at a small clearing at the edge of the non-forbidden
forest, beside a dirt trail that runs back to the gates of Hogwarts
in one direction, and off into the distance in another. There is a
carriage nearby, and the boy is standing well away from it, looking
at it, his eyes seldom wavering from its direction.</p>
<p>In the distance, a figure is approaching along the dirt path: A
man wearing professorial robes, trudging slowly with his shoulders
slumped low, his formal shoes kicking up small clouds of dust as he
walks.</p>
<p>Half a minute later, the boy darts another quick glance before
returning to his surveillance; and this glimpse shows that the
man's shoulders have straightened, his face unslackened, and that
his shoes are now walking lightly across the dirt, leaving not a
trace of dust in the air behind.</p>
<p>"Hello, Professor Quirrell," Harry said without letting his eyes
move again from the direction of their carriage.</p>
<p>"Salutations," said the calm voice of Professor Quirrell. "You
seem to be keeping your distance, Mr. Potter. I don't suppose you
see something odd about our conveyance?"</p>
<p>"Odd?" Harry echoed. "Why no, I can't say I see anything odd.
There seem to be even numbers of everything. Four seats, four
wheels, two huge skeletal winged horses..."</p>
<p>A skin-wrapped skull turned to look at him and flashed teeth,
solid and white in that black cavernous mouth, as though to
indicate that it was just about as fond of him as he was of it. The
other black leathery horse-skeleton tossed its head like it was
whickering, but there was no sound.</p>
<p>"They are Thestrals, and they have always drawn the carriage,"
Professor Quirrell said, sounding quite undisturbed as he climbed
into the front bench of the carriage, sitting down as far to the
right as possible. "They are visible only to those who have seen
death and comprehended it, a useful defense against most animal
predators. Hm. I suppose that the first time you went in front of
the Dementor, your worst memory proved to be the night of your
encounter with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded grimly. It was the right guess, even if for the
wrong reasons. <i>Those who have seen Death...</i></p>
<p>"Did you recall anything of interest, thereby?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said, "I did," only that and nothing more, for he
was not ready as yet to make accusations.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor smiled one of his dry smiles, and beckoned
with an impatient finger.</p>
<p>Harry closed the distance and climbed into the carriage,
wincing. The sense of doom had grown significantly stronger after
the day of the Dementor, even though it had been slowly weakening
before then. The greatest distance that the carriage allowed him
from Professor Quirrell no longer seemed like nearly far
enough.</p>
<p>Then the skeletal horses trotted forward and the carriage
started in motion, taking them toward the outer bounds of Hogwarts.
As it did, Professor Quirrell slumped back down into zombie-mode,
and the sense of doom retreated, though it still hovered at the
edge of Harry's perceptions, unignorable...</p>
<p>The forest scrolled by as the carriage rolled along, the trees
moving past at a speed that seemed positively glacial by comparison
to broomsticks or even cars. There was something oddly relaxing,
Harry thought, about traveling that slowly. It had certainly
relaxed the Defense Professor, who was slumped over with a small
stream of drool coming out of his slack mouth and puddling on his
robes.</p>
<p>Harry still hadn't decided what he was allowed to eat for
lunch.</p>
<p>His library research hadn't turned up any sign of wizards
speaking to nonmagical plants. Or any other nonmagical animals
besides snakes, although <i>Spell and Speak</i> by Paul Breedlove
had recounted the probably-mythical tale of a sorceress called the
Lady of Flying Squirrels.</p>
<p>What Harry <i>wanted</i> to do was ask Professor Quirrell. The
problem was that Professor Quirrell was <i>too smart</i>. Judging
by what Draco had said, the Heir of Slytherin business was a major
bombshell, and Harry wasn't sure he wanted anyone else to know. And
the instant Harry asked about Parseltongue, Professor Quirrell
would fix him with those pale blue eyes and say, 'I see, Mr.
Potter, so you taught Mr. Malfoy the Patronus Charm and
accidentally spoke to his snake.'</p>
<p>It wouldn't <i>matter</i> that it shouldn't be enough evidence
to locate the true explanation as a hypothesis, let alone overcome
its burden of prior improbability. Somehow the Defense Professor
would deduce it <i>anyway</i>. There were times when Harry
suspected that Professor Quirrell had way more background
information than he was telling, his priors were simply too good.
Sometimes he got his amazing deductions right even when his
<i>reasons</i> were wrong. The problem was that Harry couldn't see
how Professor Quirrell could've snuck in an extra clue about half
the stuff he guessed. Just <i>once</i> Harry would have liked to
make some sort of incredible deduction from something Professor
Quirrell said which would catch <i>him</i> completely off
guard.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"I shall have a bowl of green lentil soup, with soy sauce,"
Professor Quirrell said to the waitress. "And for Mr. Potter, a
plate of Tenorman's family chili."</p>
<p>Harry hesitated in sudden dismay. He'd resolved to stick to
vegetarian dishes for the moment, but he'd forgotten in his
deliberations that Professor Quirrell did the <i>actual
ordering</i> - and it would be awkward if he protested now -</p>
<p>The waitress bowed to them, and turned to go -</p>
<p>"Erm, excuse me, any meat in that from snakes or flying
squirrels?"</p>
<p>The waitress didn't so much as blink an eye, only turned back to
Harry, shook her head, bowed politely to him again, and resumed her
walk toward the door.</p>
<p>(The other parts of Harry were snickering at him. Gryffindor was
making sardonic comments about how a little social discomfort was
enough to get him to resort to <i>Cannibalism!</i> (shouted by
Hufflepuff), and Slytherin was remarking on how nice it was that
Harry's ethics were flexible when it came to important goals like
maintaining his relationship with Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<p>After the waitress had closed the door behind her, Professor
Quirrell waved a hand to slide home the locking bar, spoke the
usual four Charms to ensure privacy, and then said, "An interesting
question, Mr. Potter. I wonder why you asked it?"</p>
<p>Harry kept his face steady. "I was looking up some facts about
the Patronus Charm earlier," he said. "According to <i>The Patronus
Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn't,</i> it turns out that Godric
couldn't and Salazar could. I was surprised, so I looked up the
reference, in <i>Four Lives of Power.</i> And <i>then</i> I
discovered that Salazar Slytherin could supposedly talk to snakes."
(Temporal sequence wasn't the same as causation, it wasn't Harry's
fault if Professor Quirrell missed that.) "Further research turned
up an old story about a mother goddess type who could talk to
flying squirrels. I was a bit worried about the prospect of eating
something that could talk."</p>
<p>And Harry took a casual sip of his water -</p>
<p>- just as Professor Quirrell said, "Mr. Potter, would I be
correct in guessing that you are also a Parselmouth?"</p>
<p>When Harry was done coughing, he set his glass of water back
down on the table, fixed his gaze on Professor Quirrell's chin
rather than looking him in the eyes, and said, "So you are able to
perform Legilimency through my Occlumency barriers, then."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was grinning widely. "I shall take that as a
compliment, Mr. Potter, but no."</p>
<p>"I'm not buying this anymore," Harry said. "There's no
<i>way</i> you came to that conclusion based on that evidence."</p>
<p>"Of course not," Professor Quirrell said equably. "I had planned
to ask you that question today in any case, and simply chose an
opportune moment. I have suspected since December, in fact -"</p>
<p>"<i>December?</i>" said Harry. "I found out
<i>yesterday!</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah, so you did not realize the Sorting Hat's message to you was
in Parseltongue?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had timed it exactly right the second
time, too, just as Harry was taking a gulp of water to clear out
his throat from the first coughing fit.</p>
<p>Harry <i>hadn't</i> realized, not until just now. Of course it
was obvious the instant Professor Quirrell said it. Right,
Professor McGonagall had even <i>told</i> him not to talk to snakes
where anyone could see him, but he'd thought she'd meant not to be
seen talking to any statues or architectural features in Hogwarts
that looked like snakes. Double illusion of transparency, he'd
thought he understood her, she'd thought he understood her - but
<i>how</i> the <i>hell -</i></p>
<p>"So," Harry said, "you performed Legilimency on me during my
first Defense class, to find out what happened with the Sorting Hat
-"</p>
<p>"Then I would not have found out in December." Professor Quirell
leaned back, smiling. "This is not a puzzle you can solve on your
own, Mr. Potter, so I will reveal the answer. Over the winter
holiday, I was alerted to the fact that the Headmaster had filed a
request for a closed judicial panel to review the case of one Mr.
Rubeus Hagrid, whom you know as the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at
Hogwarts, and who was accused of the murder of Abigail Myrtle in
1943."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course," said Harry, "that makes it downright
<i>obvious</i> that I'm a Parselmouth. Professor, <i>what</i> the
sweet slithering snakes -"</p>
<p>"The <i>other</i> suspect for that murder was Slytherin's
Monster, the legendary inhabitant of Slytherin's Chamber of
Secrets. Which is why certain sources alerted me to the fact, and
why it caught my attention sufficiently that I spent a good deal of
bribe money to learn the details of the case. Now in point of fact,
Mr. Potter, Mr. Hagrid is innocent. Ridiculously obviously
innocent. He is the most blatantly innocent bystander to be
convicted by the magical British legal system since Grindelwald's
Confunding of Neville Chamberlain was pinned on Amanda Knox.
Headmaster Dippet prompted a student puppet to accuse Mr. Hagrid
because Dippet needed a scapegoat to take the blame for the death
of Miss Myrtle, and our marvelous justice system agreed that this
was plausible enough to warrant Mr. Hagrid's expulsion and the
snapping of his wand. Our current Headmaster needs merely provide
some new item of evidence significant enough to reconvene the case;
and with Dumbledore applying pressure instead of Dippet, the result
is a foregone conclusion. Lucius Malfoy has no particular reason to
fear Mr. Hagrid's vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy will only resist
to the extent that he can do so costlessly in order to impose costs
on Dumbledore, and Dumbledore is clearly willing to prosecute the
case regardless."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell took a sip of his water. "But I digress. The
new evidence that the Headmaster promises to provide is to exhibit
a previously undetected spell on the Sorting Hat, which, the
Headmaster asserts, he has personally determined to respond only to
Slytherins who are also Parselmouths. The Headmaster further argues
that this favors the interpretation that the Chamber of Secrets was
indeed opened in 1943, approximately the right time frame for
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, a known Parselmouth, to have attended
Hogwarts. It is a rather questionable logic, but a judicial panel
may rule that it swings the case far enough to bring Mr. Hagrid's
guilt into doubt, if they can manage to keep a straight face as
they say it. And now we come to the key question: <i>how</i> did
the Headmaster discover this hidden spell on the Sorting Hat?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly now. "Well now, let us
suppose that there was a Parselmouth in this year's crop of
students, a potential Heir of Slytherin. You must admit, Mr.
Potter, that you stand out as a possibility whenever extraordinary
people are considered. And if I then further ask myself which new
Slytherin would be most likely to have his mental privacy invaded
by the Headmaster, specifically hunting the memories of his
Sorting, why, you stand out even more." The smile vanished. "So you
see, Mr. Potter, it was not <i>I</i> who invaded your mind, though
I will not ask you to apologize. It is not your fault that you
believed Dumbledore's protestations of respecting your mental
privacy."</p>
<p>"My sincere apologies," Harry said, keeping his face
expressionless. The rigid control was a confession in its own
right, as was the sweat beading his forehead; but he didn't think
the Defense Professor would take any evidence from that. Professor
Quirrell would just think Harry was nervous at having been
discovered as the Heir of Slytherin. Rather than being nervous that
Professor Quirrell might realize that Harry had deliberately
betrayed Slytherin's secret... which itself was no longer seeming
like such a smart move.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Potter. Any progress on finding the Chamber of
Secrets?"</p>
<p><i>No,</i> thought Harry. But to maintain plausible deniability,
you needed a general policy of sometimes evading questions even
when you had nothing to hide... "With respect, Professor Quirrell,
if I had made such progress, it is not <i>quite</i> obvious to me
that I should tell you about it."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell sipped from his own waterglass again. "Well
then, Mr. Potter, I shall freely tell you what I know or suspect.
First, I believe the Chamber of Secrets is real, as is Slytherin's
Monster. Miss Myrtle's death was not discovered until hours after
her demise, even though the wards should have alerted the
Headmaster instantly. Therefore her murder was performed either by
Headmaster Dippet, which is unlikely, or by some entity which
Salazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the
Headmaster himself. Second, I suspect that contrary to popular
legend, the purpose of Slytherin's Monster was <i>not</i> to rid
Hogwarts of Muggleborns. Unless Slytherin's Monster were powerful
enough to defeat the Headmaster of Hogwarts and all the teachers,
it could not triumph by force. Multiple murders in secrecy would
result in the school's closure, as nearly happened in 1943, or in
the placing of new wards. So why Slytherin's Monster, Mr. Potter?
What true purpose does it serve?"</p>
<p>"Ah..." Harry dropped his gaze to his waterglass and tried to
think. "To kill anyone who got into the Chamber and didn't belong
there -"</p>
<p>"A monster powerful enough to defeat a team of wizards that had
broken past the best wards Salazar could place on his Chamber?
Unlikely."</p>
<p>Harry was feeling a bit pressured now. "Well, it's called the
Chamber of Secrets, so maybe the Monster has a secret, or <i>is</i>
a secret?" For that matter, just what sort of secrets were in the
Chamber of Secrets in the first place? Harry hadn't done a lot of
research on the subject, in part because he'd gotten the impression
that nobody knew anything -</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was smiling. "Why not just write the secret
down?"</p>
<p>"Ahhh..." said Harry. "Because if the Monster spoke
Parseltongue, that would ensure that only a true descendant of
Slytherin could hear the secret?"</p>
<p>"Easy enough to key the wards on the Chamber to a phrase spoken
in Parseltongue. Why go to the trouble of creating Slytherin's
Monster? It cannot have been easy to create a creature with a
lifespan of centuries. Come, Mr. Potter, it should be obvious; what
are the secrets that can be told from one living mind to another,
but never written down?"</p>
<p>Harry saw it then, with a burst of adrenaline that started his
heart racing, his breath coming faster. "<i>Oh.</i>"</p>
<p>Salazar Slytherin had been very cunning indeed. Cunning enough
to come up with a way to bypass the Interdict of Merlin.</p>
<p>Powerful wizardries couldn't be transmitted through books or
ghosts, but if you could create a long-lived enough sentient
creature with a good enough memory -</p>
<p>"It seems very probable to me," said Professor Quirrell, "that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to power with secrets
obtained from Slytherin's Monster. That Salazar's lost knowledge is
the source of You-Know-Who's extraordinarily powerful wizardry.
Hence my interest in the Chamber of Secrets and the case of Mr.
Hagrid."</p>
<p>"I <i>see</i>," Harry said. And if <i>he,</i> Harry, could find
Salazar's Chamber of Secrets... then all of the lost knowledge that
Lord Voldemort had obtained would be <i>his</i> as well.</p>
<p>Yes. That was <i>just</i> how the story should go.</p>
<p>Add in Harry's superior intelligence and some original magical
research and some Muggle rocket launchers, and the resulting fight
would be completely one-sided, which was exactly how Harry wanted
it.</p>
<p>Harry was grinning now, a very evil grin. <i>New priority: Find
everything in Hogwarts that looks remotely like a snake and try
speaking to it. Starting with everything you've already tried, only
this time be sure to use Parseltongue instead of English - get
Draco to let you into the Slytherin dorms -</i></p>
<p>"Don't become too excited, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell.
His own face had become expressionless, now. "You must
<i>continue</i> thinking. What were the Dark Lord's parting words
to Slytherin's Monster?"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" Harry said. "How could either of us possibly
know that?"</p>
<p>"Visualize the scene, Mr. Potter. Let your imagination fill in
the details. Slytherin's Monster - probably some great serpent, so
that only a Parselmouth may speak to it - has finished imparting
all of the knowledge it possesses to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It
conveys to him Salazar's final benediction, and warns him that the
Chamber of Secrets must now remain closed until the next descendant
of Salazar should prove cunning enough to open it. And he who will
become the Dark Lord nods, and says to it -"</p>
<p>"Avada Kedavra," said Harry, suddenly feeling sick to his
stomach.</p>
<p>"Rule Twelve," Professor Quirrell said quietly. "Never leave the
source of your power lying around where someone else can find
it."</p>
<p>Harry's gaze dropped to the tablecloth, which had decorated
itself in a mournful pattern of black flowers and shadows. Somehow
that seemed... too sad to be imagined, Slytherin's great snake had
only wanted to help Lord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had just...
there was something unbearably sorrowful about it, what sort of
person would <i>do</i> that to a being who'd offered them nothing
but friendship... "<i>Do</i> you think the Dark Lord would have
-"</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Quirrell said flatly. "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
left quite a trail of bodies behind him, Mr. Potter; I doubt he
would have omitted that one. If there were any artifacts left there
that could be moved, the Dark Lord would have taken those with him
as well. There might still be something worth seeing in the Chamber
of Secrets, and to find it would prove yourself the true Heir of
Slytherin. But do not raise your hopes too high. I suspect that all
you will find is the remains of Slytherin's Monster resting quietly
in its grave."</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while.</p>
<p>"I could be wrong," said Professor Quirrell. "In the end it is
only a guess. But I did wish to warn you, Mr. Potter, so that you
would not be too sorely disappointed."</p>
<p>Harry nodded shortly.</p>
<p>"One might even regret your infant self's victory," said
Professor Quirrell. His smile twisted. "If only You-Know-Who had
lived, you might have persuaded him to teach you some of the
knowledge that would have been your heritage, from one Heir of
Slytherin to another." The smile twisted further, as though to mock
the obvious impossibility, even given the premise.</p>
<p><i>Note to self,</i> thought Harry, with a slight chill and an
edge of anger, <i>make sure to extract my heritage out of the Dark
Lord's mind, one way or another.</i></p>
<p>There was another silence. Professor Quirrell was looking at
Harry as though waiting for him to ask something.</p>
<p>"Well," said Harry, "so long as we're on the topic, can I ask
how you think the whole Parselmouth business actually -"</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door, then. Professor Quirrell raised
a cautionary finger, then opened the door with a wave. The waitress
entered, balancing a huge platter with their meals as though the
whole assembly weighed nothing (which was in fact probably the
case). She gave Professor Quirrell his bowl of green soup, and a
glass of his usual Chianti; and set down before Harry a plate of
small meat strips smothered in a heavy-looking sauce, plus a glass
of his accustomed treacle soda. Then she bowed, managing to make it
seem like sincere respect rather than perfunctory acknowledgment,
and departed.</p>
<p>When she was gone, Professor Quirrell held up a finger for
silence again, and drew his wand.</p>
<p>And then Professor Quirrell began performing a certain series of
incantations that Harry recognized, making him take a sharp breath.
It was the series and ordering that Mr. Bester had used, the full
set of twenty-seven spells that you would perform before discussing
anything of truly great import.</p>
<p>If the discussion of the Chamber of Secrets <i>hadn't</i>
counted as important -</p>
<p>When Professor Quirrell was done - he'd performed <i>thirty</i>
spells, three of which Harry hadn't heard before - the Defense
Professor said, "Now we shall not be interrupted for a time. Can
you keep a secret, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"A serious secret, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said. His
eyes were intent, his face grave. "One which could potentially send
me to Azkaban. Think about it before you reply."</p>
<p>For a moment Harry didn't even see why the question should be
hard, given his growing collection of secrets. Then -</p>
<p><i>If this secret could send Professor Quirrell to Azkaban, that
means he's done something illegal...</i></p>
<p>Harry's brain performed a few calculations. Whatever the secret,
Professor Quirrell did not think his illegal act would reflect
badly on him in Harry's eyes. There was no advantage to be gained
from <i>not</i> hearing it. And if it did reveal something wrong
with Professor Quirrell, then it was very much to Harry's advantage
to know it, even if he had promised not to tell anyone.</p>
<p>"I never had very much respect for authority," Harry said.
"Legal and governmental authority included. I will keep your
secret."</p>
<p>Harry didn't bother asking whether the revelation was worth the
danger it would pose to Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor
wasn't stupid.</p>
<p>"Then I must test whether you are truly a descendant of
Salazar," said Professor Quirrell, and stood up from his chair.
Harry, prompted more by reflex and instinct than calculation,
shoved himself up out of his own chair as well.</p>
<p>There was a blur, a shift, a sudden motion.</p>
<p>Harry aborted his panicked backward leap halfway through,
leaving him windmilling his arms and trying not to fall over, a
frantic flush of adrenaline running through him.</p>
<p>At the other end of the room swayed a snake a meter high, bright
green and intricately banded in white and blue. Harry didn't know
enough snakelore to recognize it, but he knew that 'brightly
colored' meant 'poisonous'.</p>
<p>The constant sense of doom had diminished, ironically enough,
after the Defense Professor of Hogwarts had turned into a venomous
snake.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed hard and said, "Greetings - ah, hssss, no, ah,
<i>greetingss.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Sso,</i>" hissed the snake. "<i>You sspeak, I hear. I
sspeak, you hear?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Yess, I hear,</i>" hissed Harry. "<i>You are an
Animaguss?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Obvioussly,</i>" hissed the snake. "<i>Thirty-sseven ruless,
number thirty-four: Become Animaguss. All ssensible people do, if
can. Thuss,</i> <i>very rare.</i>" The snake's eyes were flat
surfaces ensconced within dark pits, sharp black pupils in dark
gray fields. "<i>This iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You ssee? No
otherss undersstand uss.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Even if they are ssnake Animagi?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Not unlesss heir of Sslytherin willss.</i>" The snake gave a
series of short hisses which Harry's brain translated as sardonic
laughter. "<i>Sslytherin not sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss not ssame as
Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw in sscheme.</i>"</p>
<p>Well <i>that</i> definitely argued that Parseltongue was
personal magic, not snakes being sentient beings with a learnable
language -</p>
<p>"<i>I am not regisstered,</i>" hissed the snake. The dark pits
of its eyes stared at Harry. "<i>Animaguss musst be regisstered.
Penalty is two yearss imprissonment. Will you keep my ssecret,
boy?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Yess,</i>" hissed Harry. "<i>Would never break
promisse.</i>"</p>
<p>The snake seemed to hold still, as though in shock, and then
began to sway again. "<i>We come here next in sseven dayss. Bring
cloak to passs unsseen, bring hourglasss to move through time
-</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>You know?</i>" hissed Harry in shock. "<i>How -</i>"</p>
<p>Again the series of short quick hisses that translated as
sardonic laughter. "<i>You arrive in my firsst classs while sstill
in other classs, sstrike down enemy with pie, two ballss of memory
-</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Never mind,</i>" hissed Harry. "<i>Sstupid question, forgot
you were ssmart.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Foolissh thing to forget,</i>" said the snake, but the hiss
did not seem offended.</p>
<p>"<i>Hourglasss is resstricted,</i>" Harry said. "<i>Cannot usse
until ninth hour.</i>"</p>
<p>The snake twitched its head, a snakish nod. "<i>Many
resstrictionss. Locked to your usse only, cannot be sstolen. Cannot
transsport other humanss. But ssnake carried in pouch, I ssuspect
will go with. Think posssible to hold hourglasss motionlesss within
sshell, without dissturbing wardss, while you turn sshell around
it. We will tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond
thiss. You ssay nothing, to no one. Give no ssign of expectancy,
none. Undersstand?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"<i>Ansswer in sspeech.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Yess.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Will do as I ssaid?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Yess. But,"</i> Harry gave a wobbling rasp that was how his
mind had translated a hesitant 'Ahhh' into snakish, "<i>I do not
promisse to do whatever thiss iss, you have not ssaid -</i>"</p>
<p>The snake performed a shiver that Harry's mind translated as a
severe glare. "<i>Of coursse not. Will disscusss sspecificss at
next meeting.</i>"</p>
<p>The blur and motion reversed itself, and Professor Quirrell was
standing there once more. For a moment the Defense Professor
himself seemed to sway, as the snake had swayed, and his eyes
seemed cold and flat; and then his shoulders straightened and he
was human once more.</p>
<p>And the aura of doom had returned.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's chair scooted back for him, and he sat down
in it. "No sense in letting this go to waste," Professor Quirrell
said as he picked up his spoon, "though at the moment I would much
prefer a live mouse. One can never quite disentangle the mind from
the body it wears, you see..."</p>
<p>Harry slowly took his seat and began eating.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"So the line of Salazar did not die with You-Know-Who after
all," said Professor Quirrell after a time. "It would seem that
rumors have already begun to spread, among our fine student body,
that you are Dark; I wonder what they would think, if they knew
that."</p>
<p>"Or if they knew that I had destroyed a Dementor," Harry said,
and shrugged. "I figure all the fuss will blow over over the next
time I do something interesting. Hermione is having trouble,
though, and I was wondering if you might have any suggestions for
her."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor ate several spoonfuls of soup in silence,
then; and when he spoke again, his voice was oddly flat. "You
really care about that girl."</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said quietly.</p>
<p>"I suppose that is why she was able to bring you out of your
Dementation?"</p>
<p>"More or less," Harry said. The statement was true in a way,
just not exact; it was not that his Demented self had cared, but
that it had been confused.</p>
<p>"I did not have any friends like that when I was young." Still
the same emotionless voice. "What would have become of you, I
wonder, if you had been alone?"</p>
<p>Harry shivered before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>"You must be feeling grateful to her."</p>
<p>Harry just nodded. Not quite exact, but true.</p>
<p>"Then here is what I might have done at your age, if there had
been anyone to do it for -"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="50">Chapter 50</h2><h3>Self Centeredness</h3>
<p>Padma Patil had finished her dinner a little late, getting on
toward seven-thirty, and was now striding quickly out of the Great
Hall on her way to the Ravenclaw dorm and the study rooms.
Gossiping was fun and destroying Granger's reputation was more fun,
but it could distract from schoolwork. She'd put off a six-inch
essay on <i>lomillialor</i> wood due in next morning's Herbology
class, and she needed to finish it tonight.</p>
<p>It was while she was passing through a long, twisting, narrow
stone corridor that the whisper came, sounding like it was coming
from right behind her.</p>
<p>"<i>Padma Patil...</i>"</p>
<p>She spun around quick as lightning, her wand already snatched up
from a pocket of her robes and leaping into her hands, if Harry
Potter thought he could sneak up on and scare <i>her</i> that
easily -</p>
<p>There was no one there.</p>
<p>Instantly Padma spun around and looked in the other direction,
if it had been a Ventriloquism Charm -</p>
<p>There was no one there, either.</p>
<p>The whispering sigh came again, soft and dangerous with a slight
hissing undertone.</p>
<p>"<i>Padma Patil, Slytherin girl...</i>"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, Slytherin boy," she said out loud.</p>
<p>She'd fought Potter and his Chaos Legion a dozen times over, and
she <i>knew</i> that this was Harry Potter doing this
somehow...</p>
<p>...even though the Ventriloquism Charm was only line-of-sight,
and in the winding corridor, she could easily see all the way to
the nearest twist both forward and backward, and there was no one
there...</p>
<p>...it didn't matter. She knew her enemy.</p>
<p>There was a whispery chuckle, now coming from beside her, and
she spun around and pointed her wand at the whisper and shouted
"<i>Luminos!</i>"</p>
<p>The red bolt of light shot out and struck the wall, which lit
with a crimson glow that soon faded.</p>
<p>She hadn't really expected it to work. Harry Potter couldn't
<i>possibly</i> be invisible, not really invisible, that was magic
most <i>grownups</i> couldn't do, and she'd never believed
nine-tenths of the stories about him.</p>
<p>The whispery voice laughed again, now on her other side.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter stands on the precipice," whispered the voice, now
sounding very close to her ear, "he is wavering, but you, you are
already falling, Slytherin girl..."</p>
<p>"The hat never called out Slytherin for <i>my</i> name, Potter!"
She backed up against the wall, so she wouldn't have to watch
behind herself, and raised her wand in an attack stance.</p>
<p>Again the soft laugh. "Harry Potter has been in the Ravenclaw
common room for the last half-hour, helping Kevin Entwhistle and
Michael Corner rehearse Potions recipes. But it matters not. I am
here to deliver a warning to you, Padma Patil, and if you choose to
ignore it, that is your own affair."</p>
<p>"Fine," she said coldly. "Go ahead and warn me, Potter, I'm not
afraid of you."</p>
<p>"Slytherin was a great House, once," said the whisper; it
sounded sadder, now. "Slytherin was once a House you would have
been proud to choose, Padma Patil. But something turned wrong,
something turned sour; do you know what went awry in Slytherin
House, Padma Patil?"</p>
<p>"No, and I don't care!"</p>
<p>"But you should care," said the whisper, now sounding like it
was coming from just behind her head where it stood almost pressed
against the wall. "For you are still that girl whom the Sorting Hat
offered that choice. Do you think that just choosing Ravenclaw
means that you are not Pansy Parkinson, and will not ever become
Pansy Parkinson, no matter how you conduct yourself otherwise?"</p>
<p>Despite everything, now, small chills of fear were spreading out
from her spine and running over her skin. She'd heard <i>those</i>
stories about Harry Potter too, that he was a secret Legilimens.
But she still stood straight, and she put all the bite she could
into her voice when she said, "The Slytherins went Dark to get
power, just like <i>you</i> did, Potter. And <i>I</i> won't, not
ever."</p>
<p>"But you'll spread vicious rumors about an innocent girl,"
whispered the voice, "even though it will not help you attain any
of your own ambitions, and without considering that she has
powerful allies who might take offense. That is is not the proud
Slytherin of the old days, Padma Patil, that is not the pride of
Salazar, that is Slytherin gone rotten, Padma Parkinson not Padma
Malfoy..."</p>
<p>She was getting more creeped out than she ever had been in her
life, and the possibility was starting to occur to her that this
might <i>really</i> be a ghost. She hadn't ever heard that ghosts
could hide themselves like this, but maybe they just didn't usually
do it - not to mention that most ghosts weren't this <i>eerie,</i>
they were just dead people after all - "Who <i>are</i> you? The
Bloody Baron?"</p>
<p>"When Harry Potter was bullied and beaten," the voice whispered,
"he commanded all his allies to refrain from vengeance; do you
remember that, Padma Patil? For Harry Potter is wavering, but not
yet lost; he is struggling, he knows himself to be in peril. But
Hermione Granger made no such request of her own allies. Harry
Potter is angered with you now, Padma Patil, more angered than he
would ever be on his own behalf... and <i>he</i> has allies of his
own."</p>
<p>A shudder went through her, she knew that it was visible and she
hated herself for it.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't be afraid," breathed the voice. "I will not hurt you.
For you see, Padma Patil, Hermione Granger truly is innocent.
<i>She</i> does not stand on the precipice, <i>she</i> is not
falling. She did not ask her allies to refrain from hurting you,
because the thought did not even occur to her as a possibility. And
Harry Potter knows very well that if he hurt you or caused you to
be hurt, for Hermione Granger's sake, then she would never speak to
him again until the Sun burned low and the last star failed in the
night sky." The voice was very sad now. "She truly is a kindly
girl, a person such as I could only wish to be..."</p>
<p>"Granger can't cast the Patronus Charm!" said Padma. "If she was
really as nice as she pretends to be -"</p>
<p>"Can <i>you</i> cast the Patronus Charm, Padma Patil? You dared
not even attempt it, you feared what the result would be."</p>
<p>"That's not <i>true!</i> I didn't have time, that was all!"</p>
<p>The whisper continued. "But Hermione Granger did try, openly
before her friends, and when her magic failed she was surprised and
dismayed. For there are secrets to the Patronus Charm that few ever
knew, and maybe none now know but I." A soft, whispery chuckle.
"Let it stand that it is no stain of her spirit that halts her
light from coming forth. Hermione Granger cannot cast the Patronus
Charm for the very same reason that Godric Gryffindor, who raised
these halls, never could."</p>
<p>The corridor <i>was</i> becoming colder, she was certain of it,
as though someone were using the Chilling Charm.</p>
<p>"And Harry Potter is not Hermione Granger's only ally." Now
there was an undertone of dry amusement in that whisper, it
reminded her suddenly and frighteningly of Professor Quirrell.
"Filius Flitwick and Minerva McGonagall are quite fond of her, I do
believe. Did it occur to you that if those two learned what you
were doing to Hermione Granger, they might become less fond of you?
They might not intervene openly, perhaps; but they might be a
little slower to award you House Points, a little slower to steer
opportunities your way -"</p>
<p>"Potter <i>snarked</i> on me?"</p>
<p>A ghostly chuckle, a dry heh-heh-heh. "Do you think those two
are stupid, deaf and blind?" In a sadder whisper, "Do you think
Hermione Granger is not precious to them, that they will not see
her hurting? As they might have been fond of you once, their bright
young Padma Patil, but you are throwing it away..."</p>
<p>Padma's throat was dry. She hadn't thought of that, not at
all.</p>
<p>"I wonder how many people will end up caring for you, Padma
Patil, on this path that you now tread. Is it worth that much, just
to distance yourself further from your sister? To be the shadow to
Parvati's light? Your deepest fear has always been to fall into
harmony with her, <i>back</i> into harmony with her I should say;
but is it worth hurting an innocent girl, just to make yourself
that much more different? Must you be the <i>evil</i> twin, Padma
Patil, can you not find a different good to pursue?"</p>
<p>Her heart was hammering in her chest. She'd, she'd never talked
about that with <i>anyone -</i></p>
<p>"I have always wondered at how students bully each other,"
sighed the voice. "How children make life difficult for themselves,
how they turn their schools into prisons even with their own hands.
Why do human beings make their own lives so unpleasant? I can give
you a part of the answer, Padma Patil. It is because people do not
stop and think before causing pain, if they do not imagine that
they themselves could also be hurt, that they might also suffer
from their own misdeeds. But suffer you will, oh, yes, Padma Patil,
suffer you will, if you stay on this road. You will suffer the same
pain of loneliness, the same pain of others' fear and distrust,
that you now inflict on Hermione Granger. Only for you it will be
deserved."</p>
<p>Her wand was shaking in her hand.</p>
<p>"You did not choose sides when you went to Ravenclaw, girl. You
choose your side by the way you live your life, what you do to
other people and what you do to yourself. Will you illuminate
others' lives, or darken them? That is the choice between Light and
Dark, not any word the Sorting Hat cries out. And the hard part,
Padma Patil, is not saying 'Light', the hard part is deciding which
is which, and admitting it to yourself when you begin down the
wrong road."</p>
<p>There was silence. It went on for a time, and Padma realized
that she had been dismissed.</p>
<p>Padma almost dropped her wand, when she tried to put it back
into her pocket. She almost fell, when she took a step forward away
from the wall, and turned to go -</p>
<p>"I have not always chosen rightly beween Light and Dark," the
whisper said, now loud and harsh directly into her ear. "Do not
take my wisdom as a final word, girl, do not fear to question it,
for though I tried I have sometimes failed, oh, yes, I have failed.
But you are hurting a true innocent, and you will achieve none of
your ambitions by doing so, it is not for any cunning plan. You are
inflicting pain purely for the sake of the pleasure it brings you.
I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark, but that I
know for darkness, for certain. You are hurting an innocent girl,
and escaping retribution only because she is too kindly to tolerate
her allies moving against you. I cannot hurt you for that, so know
only that I cannot respect it. You are unworthy of Slytherin; go
and do your Herbology homework, Ravenclaw girl!"</p>
<p>The final whisper came out in a louder hiss that sounded almost
like a snake, and Padma fled, she fled down the corridors like
Lethifolds were chasing her, she ran heedless of the rules about
running in the corridors, even when she passed other students who
looked at her in surprise, she did not stop, she ran all the way to
the Ravenclaw dorms with her pulse pounding in her neck, the door
asked her "Why does the Sun shine in the day instead of the
nighttime?" and it took her three tries before she could make her
answer coherent, and then the door came open and she saw -</p>
<p>- a few girls and boys, some young and some old, all staring at
her, and in one corner at the pentagonal table, Harry Potter and
Michael Corner and Kevin Entwhistle, looking up from their
textbooks.</p>
<p>"Sweet Merlin!" exclaimed Penelope Clearwater, rising from a
couch. "What happened to you, Padma?"</p>
<p>"I," she stuttered, "I, I heard - a ghost -"</p>
<p>"It wasn't the Bloody Baron, was it?" said Clearwater. She drew
her wand and a moment later she was holding a cup, and then an
<i>Aguamenti</i> later the cup was filled with water. "Here, drink
this, sit down -"</p>
<p>Padma was already striding toward the pentagonal table. She
looked at Harry Potter, who was looking at her with his own gaze,
calm and grave and a little sad.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> did this!" Padma said. "How - you - how dare
you!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden hush in the Ravenclaw dorm.</p>
<p>Harry just looked at her.</p>
<p>And said, "Is there anything I can help you with?"</p>
<p>"Don't deny it," Padma said, her voice shaking, "<i>you</i> set
that ghost on me, it <i>said</i> -"</p>
<p>"I mean it," Harry said. "Can I help you with anything? Get you
some food, or go fetch a soda for you, or help you with your
homework, or anything like that?"</p>
<p>Everyone was staring at the two of them.</p>
<p>"Why?" Padma said. She couldn't think of anything else to say,
she didn't understand.</p>
<p>"Because some of us are standing on the precipice," Harry said.
"And the difference is what you do for other people. Will you let
me help you with something, Padma, please?"</p>
<p>She stared at him, and knew, in that moment, that he'd gotten
his own warning, same as her.</p>
<p>"I..." she said. "I've got to write six inches on
<i>lomillialor</i> -"</p>
<p>"Let me run up to my dorm room and get my Herbology stuff,"
Harry said. He rose from the pentagonal table, looked at Entwhistle
and Corner. "Sorry, guys, I'll see you later."</p>
<p>They didn't say anything, just stared, along with everyone else
in the dorm room, as Harry Potter walked over to the stairs.</p>
<p>And just as he started up, he said, "And no one's to pester her
with questions unless <i>she</i> wants to talk about it, I hope
everyone's <i>got that?</i>"</p>
<p>"Got it," said most of the first years and some of the older
students, a few of them sounding quite scared.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>And she talked about a lot of things with Harry Potter besides
<i>lomillialor</i> wood - even her fear of falling back into
harmony with Parvati, which she'd never talked about with
<i>anyone</i> before, but then Harry's ghostly ally already knew.
And Harry had reached into his pouch and pulled out some <i>odd</i>
books, loaning them to her on condition of complete secrecy, saying
that if she could comprehend those books it would change the
pattern of her thinking enough that she'd never fall into harmony
with Parvati again...</p>
<p>At nine o' clock, when Harry said he had to go, the essay was
only half done.</p>
<p>And when Harry paused, and looked at her on the way out, and
said that <i>he</i> thought she was worthy of Slytherin, it made
her feel good for a whole minute before she realized what had just
been said to her and who had said it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Padma got down to breakfast, that morning, she saw Mandy
see her and whisper something to the girl sitting beside her at the
Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>She saw that girl get up from the bench and walk toward her.</p>
<p>Last night Padma had been glad that girl roomed in the other
dorm; but now that she thought about it, this was worse, now she
had to do it in front of <i>everyone</i>.</p>
<p>But even though Padma was sweating, she knew what she had to
do.</p>
<p>The girl came closer -</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"What?" said Padma. That was <i>her</i> line.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," repeated Hermione Granger. Her voice was loud so
that everyone could hear. "I... I didn't ask Harry to do that, and
I was angry with him when I found out, and I made him promise not
to do it again to <i>anyone</i>, and I'm not talking to him for a
week... I'm really, <i>really</i> sorry, Miss Patil."</p>
<p>Hermione Granger's back was stiff, her face was stiff, you could
see the sweat on her face.</p>
<p>"Um," said Padma. Her own thoughts were pretty much scrambled,
now...</p>
<p>Padma's gaze flicked to the Ravenclaw table, where one boy was
watching them with tight eyes and his hands clenched in his
lap.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Earlier:</i></p>
<p>"I told you to be <i>nicer!</i>" shrieked Hermione.</p>
<p>Harry was starting to sweat. He'd never actually heard Hermione
scream at him before, and it was quite loud in the empty
classroom.</p>
<p>"I - but - but I <i>was</i> nice!" Harry protested. "I
practically <i>redeemed</i> her, Padma was going down the wrong
path and I turned her off it! I probably changed her whole life to
be happier! Besides, you should've heard the <i>original</i>
version of what Professor Quirrell suggested I do -" at which point
Harry realized what he was saying and closed his mouth a second too
late.</p>
<p>Hermione clutched at her chestnut curls, a gesture Harry hadn't
seen from her before. "What'd <i>he</i> say to do? <i>Kill</i>
her?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor had suggested that Harry identify all the
key influential students inside and outside his year and try to
gain control of the entire Hogwarts rumor mill, remarking that this
was a generally useful and amusing challenge for any true Slytherin
attending Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"Nothing like <i>that,</i>" Harry said quickly, "he just said in
a general way that I should get influence over the people spreading
rumors, and <i>I</i> decided that the <i>nice</i> version of that
would be to just inform Padma directly about the meaning of what
she was doing, and the possible consequences of her actions,
instead of trying to threaten her or anything like that -"</p>
<p>"<i>You call that not threatening someone?</i>" Hermione's
hands were pulling at her hair now.</p>
<p>"Um..." Harry said. "I guess she might've felt a <i>little</i>
threatened, but Hermione, people will do whatever they think they
can get away with, they don't care about how much it hurts other
people if it doesn't hurt themselves, if Padma thinks there's
<i>no</i> consequences to spreading lies about you then of
<i>course</i> she'll just go on doing it -"</p>
<p>"And you think there's going to be no consequences to what
<i>you</i> did?"</p>
<p>Harry got a sudden sick feeling to his stomach.</p>
<p>Hermione had the angriest look on her that he'd ever seen. "What
do you think the other students think of you now, Harry? Of
<i>me?</i> If Harry doesn't like the way you talk about Hermione,
you'll get ghosts set on you, is that what you want them to
think?"</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth and no words came out, he just... hadn't
thought about it that way, actually...</p>
<p>Hermione reached down to grab her books from the table where
she'd slammed them. "I'm not talking to you for a week, and I'll
<i>tell</i> everyone I'm not talking to you for a week, and I'll
tell them <i>why</i>, and <i>maybe</i> that'll undo some of what
you just did. And after that week, I'll - I'll decide then what to
do, I guess -"</p>
<p>"<i>Hermione!</i>" Harry's own voice rose to a shriek of
desperation. "<i>I was trying to help!</i>"</p>
<p>The girl turned back and looked at him as she opened the
classroom door.</p>
<p>"Harry," she said, and her voice trembled a little beneath the
anger, "Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness, he
really is, I mean it, Harry."</p>
<p>"This... wasn't him, this wasn't what he said to do, this was
just <i>me</i> -"</p>
<p>Hermione's voice was almost a whisper now. "Someday you're going
to go out to lunch with him, and it will be your dark side that
comes back, or maybe even you won't come back at all."</p>
<p>"I promise you," Harry said, "that I <i>will</i> come back from
lunch."</p>
<p>He wasn't even thinking as he said it.</p>
<p>And Hermione just turned around and strode out and slammed the
door behind her.</p>
<p><i>Way to invoke the laws of dramatic irony, moron,</i> observed
Harry's Internal Critic. <i>Now you're going to die this Saturday,
your last words will be 'I'm sorry, Hermione', and she'll always
regret that the last thing she did was slam the door -</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, shut up.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
When Padma sat down with Hermione for breakfast, and said in a
voice loud enough for others to hear that the ghost had just told
her things that were important for her to hear, and Harry Potter
had been right to do it, there were some people who were less
frightened afterward, and some who were frightened more.
<p>And afterward people <i>did</i> say fewer nasty things about
Hermione, at least in the first year, at least in public where
Harry Potter might hear about it.</p>
<p>When Professor Flitwick asked Harry if he was responsible for
what had happened to Padma, and Harry said yes, Professor Flitwick
told him that he was to serve two days' detention. Even if it had
only been a ghost and Padma hadn't been hurt, still, that wasn't
acceptable behavior for a Ravenclaw student. Harry nodded and said
that he understood why the Professor had to do that, and wouldn't
protest; but considering that it <i>did</i> seem to have turned
Padma around, did Professor Flitwick really think, off the record,
that he'd done the wrong thing? And Professor Flitwick paused,
seeming to actually think about it, and then said to Harry, in a
solemnly squeaky voice, that he needed to learn how to relate to
other students the normal way.</p>
<p>And Harry couldn't help but think that this was advice that
Professor Quirrell would never give him.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but think that if he'd done it Professor
Quirrell's way, the normal <i>Slytherin</i> way, a mixture of
positive and negative incentives to bring Padma and the other
rumor-mongers under his explicit control, then Padma wouldn't have
talked about it, and Hermione would have never found out...</p>
<p>...in which case Padma wouldn't have been redeemed, she would
have stayed on the wrong path, and she herself would have suffered
from that eventually. It wasn't as if Harry had <i>lied</i> to
Padma in any way, when he was Time-Turned and invisible and using
the Ventriloquism Charm.</p>
<p>Harry still wasn't sure whether he'd done the right thing, or
<i>a</i> right thing, and Hermione hadn't relented on not talking
to him - though she was talking a lot with Padma. It hurt more than
Harry had expected, going back to studying by himself; like his
brain had already started to forget its long-honed skill of being
alone.</p>
<p>The days until Saturday's lunch with Professor Quirrell seemed
to go by very, very slowly.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="51">Chapter 51</h2><h3>Title Redacted, Pt
1</h3>
<p>Saturday.</p>
<p>Harry had run into trouble falling asleep Friday night, which he
had anticipated might happen, and so he had decided to take the
obvious advance precaution of buying a sleeping potion; and to
prevent it from constituting a visible sign that he was nervous, he
had decided to buy it off Fred and George a couple of months
earlier. <i>(Be prepared, that's the Boy Scout's marching
song...)</i></p>
<p>Thus Harry was fully rested, and his pouch contained almost
everything which he owned and might conceivably need. Harry had, in
fact, run into the volume limitation on the pouch; and keeping in
mind that he would need to store a large snake, and might need to
store who-knew-what-else, he had removed some of the bulkier items,
like the car battery. He was up to the point now where he could
Transfigure something the size of a car battery in four minutes
flat, so it wasn't much of a loss.</p>
<p>Harry <i>had</i> kept the emergency flares and the oxyacetylene
welding torch and fuel tank, since you couldn't just Transfigure
things that were to be burned.</p>
<p><i>(Be prepared, as through life you march along...)</i></p>
<p>Mary's Place.</p>
<p>After the waitress had taken their order and bowed to them and
left the room, Professor Quirrell had performed only four Charms,
and then they'd talked about nothing of any vast consequence, just
Professor Quirrell's complex thesis about how the Dark Lord's curse
on the Defense position had led to the decline of dueling and how
this had changed social customs in magical Britain. Harry listened
and nodded and said intelligent things, while he tried to control
the pounding of his heart.</p>
<p>Then the waitress came in again bearing their food, and this
time, a minute after the waitress had departed, Professor Quirrell
gestured for the door to close and lock, and began to speak
twenty-nine security Charms, one of the ones in Mr. Bester's
sequence being left out this time, which somewhat puzzled
Harry.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell finished his Charms -</p>
<p>- stood up from his chair -</p>
<p>- blurred into a green snake, banded in blue and white -</p>
<p>- hissed, "<i>Hungry, boy? Eat your fill sswiftly, we sshall
need both sstrength and time.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry's eyes were a bit wide, but he hissed, "<i>I ate well at
breakfasst,</i>" and then rapidly began forking noodles into his
mouth.</p>
<p>The snake watched him for a moment, with those flat eyes, and
then hissed, "<i>Do not wissh to explain here. Prefer to be
elssewhere firsst. Need to leave unobsserved, without ssign we have
ever departed room.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Sso no one can track uss,</i>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>Yess. Do you trusst me that much, boy? Think before ansswer.
I will have important requesst of you, which requiress trusst; if
ssay no regardlesss, then ssay no now.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry dropped his gaze from the snake's flat eyes, and looked
back down at his sauce-coated noodles, and ate another bite, then
another, while he thought.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor... was an ambiguous figure, to put it
mildly; Harry thought he had unraveled some of his goals, but
others remained mysterious.</p>
<p>But Professor Quirrell had knocked down two hundred girls to
stop the ones summoning Harry. Professor Quirrell had deduced that
the Dementor was draining Harry through his wand. The Defense
Professor had saved Harry's life, twice, in a two-week period.</p>
<p>Which could mean that the Defense Professor was just saving
Harry <i>for later,</i> that there were ulterior motives. Indeed,
it was <i>certain</i> that there were ulterior motives. Professor
Quirrell wasn't doing this on a whim. But then Professor Quirrell
had also seen Harry taught Occlumency, he had taught Harry how to
lose... if the Defense Professor wanted to make some use of Harry
Potter, it was a use that required a strengthened Harry Potter, not
a weakened one. That was what it meant to be used by a friend, that
they would want the use to make you stronger instead of weaker.</p>
<p>And if there was sometimes a cold atmosphere about the Defense
Professor, bitterness in his voice or emptiness in his gaze, then
Harry was the only one who Professor Quirrell allowed to see
it.</p>
<p>Harry didn't quite know how to describe in words the sense of
kinship he felt with Professor Quirrell, except to say that the
Defense Professor was the only <i>clear-thinking</i> person Harry
had met in the wizarding world. Sooner or later everyone else
started playing Quidditch, or not putting protective shells on
their time machines, or thinking that Death was their friend. It
didn't matter how good their intentions were. Sooner or later, and
usually sooner, they demonstrated that something deep inside their
brain was confused. Everyone except Professor Quirrell. It was a
bond that went beyond anything of debts owed, or even anything of
personal liking, that the two of them were alone in the wizarding
world. And if the Defense Professor occasionally seemed a little
scary or a little Dark, well, that was just the same thing some
people said about Harry.</p>
<p>"<i>I trusst you,</i>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>And the snake explained the first stage of the plan.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed. Beside him,
Professor Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his soup
placidly, as though nothing of special interest were occurring.</p>
<p>Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from his
chair, already feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest.
The security precautions they were taking were literally the most
stringent possible...</p>
<p>"Are you ready to test it, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said
calmly.</p>
<p>It <i>wasn't</i> a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn't say
that, not out loud in human speech, even in this room screened to
the limit that Professor Quirrell had secured with further
Charms.</p>
<p>"Yep," Harry said as casually as he could.</p>
<p><i>Step one.</i></p>
<p>Harry said "Cloak" to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of
Invisibility, and then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it
toward the other side of the table.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand,
bent down, and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet
incantation. The new enchantments would ensure that Professor
Quirrell could enter the pouch on his own in snakeform, and leave
it on his own, and hear what went on outside while he was in the
pouch.</p>
<p><i>Step two.</i></p>
<p>As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he'd bent over by the
pouch, and put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry's
direction, and there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry's
chest near where the Time-Turner lay, like something creepy had
passed very close by without touching him.</p>
<p><i>Step three.</i></p>
<p>The Defense Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense
of doom diminished; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the
pouch's mouth opening to admit the green shape, and as the mouth
closed again behind the tail, the sense of doom diminished
further.</p>
<p><i>Step four.</i></p>
<p>Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it,
so that the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor
Quirrell had anchored the hourglass within the shell in its current
orientation. "<i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>," murmured Harry, and the
pouch began to float toward him.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch
began to float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the
pouch was opening, in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm
to propel it away from him as fast as possible.</p>
<p>As the pouch came within a meter of Harry, the sense of doom
returned.</p>
<p>As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom was
stronger than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was
tolerable.</p>
<p>Even with Professor Quirrell's Animagus form lying within the
extended space of the pouch resting on Harry's very hip.</p>
<p><i>Step five.</i></p>
<p>Harry sheathed his wand. His other hand still held the Cloak of
Invisibility, and Harry drew that cloak over himself.</p>
<p><i>Step six.</i></p>
<p>And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which
Professor Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not
until <i>after</i> Harry was wearing the true Cloak of Invisibility
that he reached beneath his shirt and twisted the outer shell of
the Time-Turner just once.</p>
<p>The Time-Turner's inner hourglass stayed anchored and
motionless, the setting twisted around it -</p>
<p>The food vanished from the table, the chairs leaped back into
place, the door sprang open.</p>
<p>Mary's Room was deserted, as it should have been, because
Professor Quirrell had earlier contacted Mary's Place under a false
name to inquire whether the room would be available at this hour -
not to reserve it, not to place a canceled reservation that might
be noted, but only to inquire.</p>
<p><i>Step seven.</i></p>
<p>Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the
open door. He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary's Place to the
well-stocked bar that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner,
Jake. There were only a few people at the bar, in the morning
before proper lunchtime, and Harry had to wait invisibly by the
door for several minutes, listening to the murmur of conversation
and the gurgle of alcohol, before the door opened to admit a huge
genial Irishman, and Harry slipped out silently in his wake.</p>
<p><i>Step eight.</i></p>
<p>Harry walked for a while. He was well away from Mary's Place
when he turned off Diagon Alley into a smaller alley, at the end of
which lay a shop that was dark, the windows enchanted to
blackness.</p>
<p><i>Step nine.</i></p>
<p>"Sword fish melon friend," Harry spoke the passphrase to the
lock, and it clicked open.</p>
<p>Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open door
briefly illuminating it to show a wide, empty room. The furniture
shop which had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few months
ago, according to the Defense Professor, and the shop had been
repossessed, but not yet resold. The walls were painted a simple
white, the wooden floor scratched and unpolished, a single closed
door set in the back wall; this had been a showroom, once, but now
it showed nothing.</p>
<p>The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was
pitch and complete.</p>
<p><i>Step ten.</i></p>
<p>Harry took out his wand and said "<i>Lumos</i>", lighting the
room with white glow; he took his pouch from his belt (the sense of
doom growing a little sharper as he grasped it with his fingers)
and lightly tossed it to the opposite side of the room (the sense
of doom fading almost completely). And then he began to take off
the Cloak of Invisibility, even as his voice hissed, <i>"It iss
done.</i>"</p>
<p><i>Step eleven.</i></p>
<p>From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a
meter-long green body as the snake slithered out. A moment later,
the snake blurred into Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p><i>Step twelve.</i></p>
<p>Harry waited in silence while the Defense Professor recited
thirty Charms.</p>
<p>"All right," Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had
finished. "If anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case
doomed, so I will speak plainly and in human form. Parseltongue
does not quite suit me, I fear, as I am neither a descendant of
Salazar nor a true snake."</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, his
pale blue eyes dark and shadowed in the white light coming from
Harry's wand. "We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important
question to ask you."</p>
<p>"Go ahead," said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster.</p>
<p>"What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?"</p>
<p>That wasn't quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was
close enough, so Harry said, "Based on my limited knowledge, I
would say that both the Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be
stupid, corrupt, and evil."</p>
<p>"Correct," Professor Quirrell said. "Do you understand why I
ask?"</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight
in the eyes, unflinching. Harry had finally worked out that the way
to make amazing deductions from scanty evidence was to know the
answer in advance, and he had guessed this answer fully a week ago.
It needed only a slight adjustment...</p>
<p>"You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full
of interesting people like yourself," said Harry, "one of whose
goals is to reform or overthrow the government of magical Britain,
and yes, I'm in."</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this
conversation," said Professor Quirrell. The corners of his lips
were twitching slightly. "I merely planned to ask for your help in
doing something extremely treasonous and illegal."</p>
<p><i>Darn,</i> thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell hadn't
<i>denied</i> it... "Go on."</p>
<p>"Before I do," said Professor Quirrell. There was no levity in
his voice, now. "<i>Are</i> you open to such requests, Mr. Potter?
I say again that if you are likely to say no regardless, you must
say no now. If your curiosity impels you otherwise, squash it."</p>
<p>"Treasonous and illegal doesn't bother me," said Harry. "Risks
bother me and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can't
imagine <i>you</i> taking risks frivolously."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell nodded. "I would not. It is a terrible abuse
of my friendship with you, and of such trust as is placed in my
teaching position at Hogwarts -"</p>
<p>"You can skip this part," Harry said.</p>
<p>The lips twitched again, and then went flat. "Then I shall skip
it. Mr. Potter, you sometimes make a game of lying with truths,
playing with words to conceal your meanings in plain sight. I, too,
have been known to find that amusing. But if I so much as
<i>tell</i> you what I hope we shall do this day, Mr. Potter, you
will <i>lie</i> about it. You will lie straight out, without
hesitation, without wordplay or hints, to anyone who asks about it,
be they foe or closest friend. You will lie to Malfoy, to Granger,
and to McGonagall. You will speak, always and without hesitation,
in <i>exactly</i> the fashion you would speak if you knew nothing,
with no concern for your honor. That also is how it must be."</p>
<p>There was silence, then, for a time.</p>
<p>That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry's soul.</p>
<p>"Without telling me yet..." said Harry. "Can you say if the need
is desperate?"</p>
<p>"There is someone in the most terrible want of your help,"
Professor Quirrell said simply, "and there is no one who can help
them but you."</p>
<p>There was another silence, but not a long one.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said quietly. "Tell me of the mission."</p>
<p>The dark robes of the Defense Professor seemed to blur against
the shadow on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white
light of Harry's wand. "The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr. Potter,
wards off a Dementor's fear. But the Dementors still see you
through it, they know that you are there. Only not your Patronus
Charm. It blinds them, or more than blinds them. What I saw beneath
the cloak wasn't even looking in our direction as you killed it; as
though it had forgotten our existence, even as it died."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. That wasn't surprising, not when you confronted a
Dementor on the level of its true existence, beyond
anthropomorphism. Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn't a
sentient enemy. When humanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox
hadn't fought back.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, the central branch of Gringotts is guarded by every
spell high and low that the goblins know. Even so those vaults have
been successfully robbed; for what wizardry can do, wizardry can
undo. And yet no one has ever escaped from Azkaban. No one. For
every Charm there is a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a
bypass. How can it be that no one has ever been rescued from
Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"Because Azkaban has something invincible," Harry said.
"Something so terrible that no one can defeat it."</p>
<p>That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be,
nothing human. It was Death that guarded Azkaban.</p>
<p>"The Dementors don't like their meals being taken away from
them," Professor Quirrell said. Coldness had entered that voice,
now. "They know if anyone tries. There are more than a hundred
Dementors there, and they speak to the guards as well. It's that
simple, Mr. Potter. If you're a powerful wizard then Azkaban isn't
hard to enter, and it isn't hard to leave. So long as you don't try
to take anything out of it that belongs to the Dementors."</p>
<p>"But the Dementors are <i>not</i> invincible," said Harry. He
could have cast the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very
moment. "Never believe that they are."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's voice was very quiet. "Do you remember what
it was like when you went before the Dementor, the first time, when
you failed?"</p>
<p>"I remember."</p>
<p>And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry
knew where this was going; he should have seen it before.</p>
<p>"There is an innocent person in Azkaban," Professor Quirrell
said.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but
he didn't cry.</p>
<p>"The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse," said
the Defense Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater
shadow. "There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if
you have the time for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of
which I will not speak. I cannot tell you how I know this, how I
know any of this, cannot hint at it even to you, you will have to
trust me. But there is a person in Azkaban who never once chose to
serve the Dark Lord, who has spent years suffering alone in the
most terrible cold and darkness imaginable, and never deserved a
single minute of it."</p>
<p>Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing
almost ahead of his thoughts.</p>
<p><i>There was no hint, no warning, we all thought -</i></p>
<p>"A person by the name of Black," Harry said.</p>
<p>There was silence. Silence, while the pale blue eyes stared at
him.</p>
<p>"Well," said Professor Quirrell after a while. "So much for not
telling you the name until after you had accepted the mission. I
would ask whether you're reading <i>my</i> mind, but that's flatly
impossible."</p>
<p>Harry said nothing, but it was simple enough if you
<i>believed</i> in the processes of modern democracy. The most
obvious person in Azkaban to be innocent was the one who hadn't
gotten a trial -</p>
<p>"I am <i>certainly</i> impressed, Mr. Potter," said Professor
Quirrell. His face was grave. "But this is a serious matter, and if
there is some way others could make the same deduction, I
<i>must</i> know. So tell me, Mr. Potter. How in the name of
Merlin, of Atlantis, and the void between the stars, did you guess
that I was talking about Bellatrix?"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="52">Chapter 52</h2><h3>The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 2</h3>
<p>The adrenaline was already flowing in Harry's veins, his heart
already hammering in his chest, there in that darkened and bankrupt
store. Professor Quirrell had finished explaining, and in one hand,
Harry held a tiny wooden twig that would be the key. This was it,
this was the day and the moment when Harry started acting the part.
His first true adventure, a dungeon to be pierced, an evil
government to be defied, a maiden in distress to be rescued. Harry
should have been more frightened, more reluctant, but instead he
felt only that it was time and past time to start becoming the
people he had read about in his books; to begin his journey toward
what he had always known he was meant to be, a hero. To take the
first step on the road that led to Kimball Kinnison and Captain
Picard and Liono of Thundera and definitely <i>not</i> Raistlin
Majere. So far as Harry's brain knew from watching early morning
cartoons, when you grew up you were supposed to gain amazing powers
and save the universe, that was what Harry's brain had seen adults
doing and adopted as its role model for the maturation process, and
Harry very much wanted to start growing up.</p>
<p>And if the pattern of the story called for the hero to lose some
part of his innocence, as the result of his first adventure; then
for now, at least, in this still-innocent moment, it seemed time
and past time for him to experience that pain. Like casting off
clothes too small for him; or like finally advancing to the next
stage of the game, after being stuck for eleven years on world 3,
level 2 of Super Mario Brothers.</p>
<p>Harry had read enough novels to suspect that he wouldn't feel
this enthusiastic afterward, so he was enjoying it while it
lasted.</p>
<p>There was a popping sound as something near Harry disappeared,
and then there was no more time for heroic brooding.</p>
<p>Harry's hand snapped the small wooden twig.</p>
<p>A hook yanked motionlessly at Harry's abdomen as the portkey
activated, feeling like a much harder pull this time than the
smaller transports between the Hogwarts grounds and Diagon Alley
-</p>
<p>- and dropped him into the middle of a huge roll of thunder
dying away, and a lash of cold rain whipping him across the face,
the water coating Harry's glasses and blinding him in an instant,
turning the world into a blur even as he began to fall toward the
raging ocean waves far below.</p>
<p>He had arrived high, high, high above the empty North Sea.</p>
<p>The shock of the blasting storm almost made Harry let go of the
broomstick that Professor Quirrell had given him, which would not
have been a good idea. It took nearly a full second for Harry to
get his wits together and bring his broomstick back up in an easy
swoop.</p>
<p>"I'm here," said an unfamiliar voice from a patch of empty air
above him; low and gravelly, the voice of the sallow lanky bearded
man Professor Quirrell had Polyjuiced into before Disillusioning
himself and his broomstick.</p>
<p>"I'm here," Harry said from beneath the Cloak of Invisibility.
He hadn't used Polyjuice himself. Wearing a different body hindered
your magic, and Harry might need all of his little magic about him;
thus the plan called for Harry to stay invisible at nearly all
times, instead of Polyjuicing.</p>
<p>(Neither of them had spoken the other's name. You simply didn't
use your names at any point during an illegal mission, even
invisibly hovering over an anonymous patch of water in the North
Sea. You simply didn't. It would be stupid.)</p>
<p>Carefully keeping a grip on the broomstick with one hand, while
the rain and wind howled around him, Harry raised his wand in an
equally careful grip and Imperviused his glasses.</p>
<p>Then, with the lenses clear, Harry looked around.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by wind and rain, it might have been five
degrees Celsius if he was lucky; he'd already had a Warming Charm
cast on himself just from being outside in February, but it wasn't
standing up to the driving cold droplets. Worse than snow, the rain
soaked into every exposed surface. The Cloak of Invisibility turned
all of you invisible, but it didn't <i>cover</i> all of you, and
that meant it didn't protect all of you from rain. Harry's face was
exposed to the full force of the driven water, and it was driving
straight into his neck and soaking down into his shirt, also the
sleeves of his robes and the cuffs of his pants and his shoes, the
water took every bit of cloth as an avenue to sneak in.</p>
<p>"This way," said the Polyjuiced voice, and a spark of green
light lit up in front of Harry's broomstick, and then darted away
in a direction that seemed to Harry like every other direction.</p>
<p>Through the blinding rain, Harry followed. He lost it sometimes,
that small green spark, and each time he did, Harry called out, and
the spark would reappear in front of him a few seconds later.</p>
<p>When Harry had caught the trick of following the spark, it
accelerated, and Harry kicked the broomstick into high gear and
followed. The rain whipped him harder, feeling like Harry imagined
it must feel to get a faceful of shotgun pellets, but his glasses
stayed clear and protected his eyes.</p>
<p>It was only a few minutes later, at the broomstick's full speed,
that Harry caught a glimpse of a huge shadow through the rain,
towering far across the waters.</p>
<p>And felt a distant, hollow echo of emptiness radiating from
where Death waited, washing over Harry's mind and parting around
it, like a wave breaking on stone. Harry knew his enemy this time,
and his will was steel and all of the light.</p>
<p>"I can already feel the Dementors," said the gravelly voice of
the Polyjuiced Quirrell. "I did not expect that, not this
soon."</p>
<p>"Think of the stars," Harry said, over a distant rumble of
thunder. "Don't allow any anger in you, nothing negative, just
think of the stars, what it feels like to forget yourself and fall
bodilessly through space. Hold to that thought like an Occlumency
barrier across your entire mind. The Dementors will have some
trouble reaching past that."</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, then, "Interesting."</p>
<p>The green spark lifted, and Harry inclined his broomstick
slightly upward to follow, even as it steered them into a fogbank,
a cloud hovering low on the waters.</p>
<p>Soon they were hovering above and slightly oblique of the huge
three-sided metal building, as it loomed far below. The triangle of
steel was hollow, not solid, it was a building of three thick solid
walls and no center. The Aurors on guard roomed in the top level
and southern side of the building, Professor Quirrell had said,
protected by their Patronus Charms. The legal entrance into Azkaban
was on the roof of the southwest corner of the building. Which the
two of them wouldn't use, of course. Instead they would use a
corridor that ran directly beneath the northern corner of the
building. Professor Quirrell would go down first, and puncture a
hole in the roof and its wards right at the northern tip, leaving
behind an illusion to cover the gap.</p>
<p>The prisoners were kept in the side of the building, in levels
corresponding to their crimes. And at the bottom, in the uttermost
center and depth of Azkaban, lay a nest of more than a hundred
Dementors. Loads of dirt were occasionally dropped in to keep up
the level, as the matter directly exposed to the Dementors broke
down into mud and nothingness...</p>
<p>"Wait one minute," said the rough voice, "follow me at speed,
and pass through with care."</p>
<p>"Got it," Harry said lowly.</p>
<p>The spark winked out, and Harry began to count, <i>one one
thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...</i></p>
<p><i>...sixty one thousand,</i> and Harry dived, the wind
shrieking around him as he dived, down toward the vast metal
structure, down toward where he could feel the shadows of Death
waiting for him, draining light and radiating emptiness, as the
metal structure grew larger and larger. Plain and featureless
loomed the vast grey shape, but for a single raised boxlike
structure in the southwest corner. The north corner was simply
blank, Professor Quirrell's hole undetectable.</p>
<p>Harry pulled up sharply as he approached the north corner,
giving himself more safety margin than he would have bothered with
in flying classes, but not too much. As soon as he'd come to a
halt, he began to slowly lower his broomstick again, toward what
looked like the solid roof of the tip of the north corner.</p>
<p>Descending through the illusory roof while invisible was a
strange experience, and then Harry found himself in a metal
corridor lighted with a dim orange light - which, Harry realized
after a startled glance, was coming from an old-fashioned mantled
gas lamp...</p>
<p>...for magic would fail, be drained away after a time, in the
presence of Dementors.</p>
<p>Harry dismounted his broom.</p>
<p>The pull of the emptiness was stronger now, as it parted and
flowed around Harry without touching him. They were distant but
they were many, the wounds in the world; Harry could have pointed
to them with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>"<i>Casst your Patronuss,</i>" hissed a snake from the floor,
looking more discolored than green in the dim orange light.</p>
<p>The note of stress came through even in Parseltongue. Harry was
surprised; Professor Quirrell had said that Animagi in their
Animagus forms were much less vulnerable to Dementors. (For the
same reason the Patronuses were animals, Harry assumed.) If
Professor Quirrell was in this much trouble in his snake form, what
had been happening to him while he was in the human form that let
him use his magic...?</p>
<p>Harry's wand was already rising in his hand.</p>
<p>This would be the beginning.</p>
<p>Even if it was only one person, just one person that he could
save from the darkness, even if he wasn't powerful enough yet to
teleport <i>all</i> of Azkaban's prisoners to safety and burn the
triangular hell down to bedrock...</p>
<p>Even so it was a start, it was a beginning, it was a down
payment on everything that Harry meant to accomplish with his life.
No more waiting, no more hoping, no more mere promising, it would
all begin here. Here and <i>now.</i></p>
<p>Harry's wand slashed down to point at where the Dementors waited
far below.</p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>"</p>
<p>The glowing humanoid figure blazed up into existence. It wasn't
the sun-bright thing that it had been before... probably because
Harry hadn't quite been able to stop himself from thinking about
all the <i>other</i> prisoners in their cells, the ones that he
<i>wasn't</i> here to save.</p>
<p>It might be for the best, though. Harry would need to keep this
Patronus going for a while, and it might be better if it wasn't
quite so bright.</p>
<p>The Patronus dimmed a little further, at that thought; and then
further again, as Harry tried to put a little less of his strength
into it, until finally the brilliant humanoid figure was glowing
only slightly brighter than the brightest animal Patronus, and
Harry felt that he could dim it no further without risking losing
it entirely.</p>
<p>And then, "<i>It iss sstable,</i>" Harry hissed, and began
feeding his broomstick into his pouch. His wand stayed in his hand,
and a slight, sustainable flow from him replaced the slight losses
from his Patronus.</p>
<p>The snake blurred into the form of a lanky, sallow man, holding
Professor Quirrell's wand in one hand and a broomstick in the
other. The lanky man staggered as he came back into existence, and
went to lean against the wall for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well done, if perhaps a trifle slow," murmured the gravelly
voice. Professor Quirrell's dryness was in it, even though it
didn't fit the voice, nor did the grave look on the thickly bearded
face. "I cannot feel them at all, now."</p>
<p>A moment later, the broomstick went into the man's robes and
vanished. Then the man's wand rose and tapped on his head, and with
a sound like a cracking eggshell he disappeared once more.</p>
<p>Within the air blossomed a faint green spark, and Harry, still
enshrouded in the Cloak of Invisibility, followed after.</p>
<p>If you had been watching from outside, you would have seen
nothing but a small green spark drifting through the air, and a
brilliantly silver humanoid walking after it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>They went down, and down, and down, passing gas lamp after gas
lamp, and the occasional huge metal door, descending into Azkaban
within what seemed like utter silence. Professor Quirrell had set
up some type of barrier by which <i>he</i> could hear what went on
nearby, but no sounds could pass outward, and no sounds could reach
Harry.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't quite been able to stop his mind from wondering
<i>why</i> the silence, or stop his mind from giving the answer.
The answer he'd already known on some wordless level of
anticipation that had prompted him to futilely try not to think
about it.</p>
<p>Somewhere behind those huge metal doors, people were
screaming.</p>
<p>The silver humanoid figure wavered, brightening and dimming,
every time Harry thought about it.</p>
<p>Harry had been told to cast a Bubble-Head Charm on himself. To
prevent himself from smelling anything.</p>
<p>All the enthusiasm and heroism had worn off already, as Harry
had known it would, it hadn't taken long even by his standards, the
process had completed itself the very first time they passed one of
those metal doors. Every metal door was locked with a huge lock, a
lock of simple unmagical metal that wouldn't have stopped a
first-year Hogwarts student - if you still had a wand, if you still
had your magic, which the prisoners didn't. Those metal doors were
not the doors of individual cells, Professor Quirrell had said,
each one opened into a corridor in which there would be a group of
cells. Somehow that helped a little, not thinking that each door
corresponded directly to a prisoner who was waiting right behind
it. Instead there might be <i>more</i> than one prisoner, which
diminished the emotional impact; just like the study showing that
people contributed more when they were told that a given amount of
money was required to save one child's life, than when told the
same total amount was needed to save eight children...</p>
<p>Harry was finding it increasingly hard not to think about it,
and every time he did, the light of his Patronus fluctuated.</p>
<p>They came to the place where the passageway turned left, at the
corner of the triangular building. Once again there were descending
metal steps, another flight of stairs; once again they went
down.</p>
<p>Mere murderers were not put into the lowest of cells. There was
always a lower place you could go, an even worse punishment to
fear. No matter how low you had already sunk, the government of
magical Britain had some threat remaining against you if you did
even worse.</p>
<p>But Bellatrix Black had been the Death Eater who inspired more
fear than anyone save Lord Voldemort himself, a beautiful and
deadly sorceress absolutely loyal to her master; she had been, if
such a thing were possible, more sadistic and evil even than
You-Know-Who, as though she were trying to outdo her master...</p>
<p>...that was what the world knew of her, what the world believed
of her.</p>
<p>But before then, Professor Quirrell had told Harry, before the
debut of the Dark Lord's most terrible servant, there had been a
girl in Slytherin who had been quiet, keeping mostly to herself,
harming no one. Afterward there had been made-up stories told about
her, memories changing in retrospect (Harry knew well the research
on that). But at the time, while she still attended school, the
most talented witch in Hogwarts had been known as a gentle girl
(Professor Quirrell had said). Her few friends had been surprised
when she'd joined the Death Eaters, and more surprised that she'd
been hiding so much darkness behind that sad, wistful smile.</p>
<p>That was who Bellatrix had once been, the most promising witch
of her own generation, before the Dark Lord stole her and broke
her, shattered her and reshaped her, binding her to him on a deeper
level and with darker arts than any Imperius.</p>
<p>Ten years Bellatrix had served the Dark Lord, killing who he
bade her kill, torturing who he bade her torture.</p>
<p>And then the Dark Lord had finally been defeated.</p>
<p>And Bellatrix's nightmare had continued.</p>
<p>Somewhere inside Bellatrix there might be something that was
still screaming, that had been screaming the whole time, something
a psychiatric Healer could bring back; or there might not be,
Professor Quirrell had no way of knowing. But either way, they
could...</p>
<p>...they could at least get her out of Azkaban...</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black had been put into the lowest level of
Azkaban.</p>
<p>Harry was having trouble not imagining what he would see when
they got to her cell. Bellatrix must have had almost no fear of
death, in the beginning, if she was still alive at all.</p>
<p>They descended another flight of stairs, coming that much closer
to Death and Bellatrix, the clacking of their invisible shoes the
only sound that Harry could hear. Dim orange light coming from the
gas lights, the faint green spark drifting through the air, the
shining figure following with its silver light fluctuating from
time to time.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>After descending many times, they came in time to a corridor
that did not end in stairs, and a final metal door, and the green
spark halted before it.</p>
<p>Harry's heart had calmed a little, as they descended far into
the depths of Azkaban without anything happening. But now it was
hammering his chest once more. They were at the bottom, and the
shadows of Death were very close at hand.</p>
<p>A soft metal click came from the lock, as Professor Quirrell
opened the way.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and remembered everything that
Professor Quirrell had told him. The hard part wouldn't just be
getting the pretended personality right enough to fool Bellatrix
Black herself, the hard part would be keeping his Patronus going at
the same time...</p>
<p>The green spark winked out, and a moment later a meter-high
snake shimmered into existence, no longer invisible.</p>
<p>The metal door moved with a slow creaking sound as Harry pushed
on it with his invisible hand, opened it just a crack, and peered
through.</p>
<p>He saw a straight corridor that terminated in solid stone. There
was no light there but what crept in from Harry's Patronus. That
was bright enough for him to see the outer bars of the eight cells
set into the corridor, but he couldn't see the insides; more
importantly, though, he didn't see anyone in the corridor
itself.</p>
<p>"<i>I ssee nothing,</i>" hissed Harry.</p>
<p>The snake darted on ahead, swiftly twisting across the
floor.</p>
<p>A moment later -</p>
<p>"<i>Sshe iss alone,</i>" hissed the snake.</p>
<p><i>Stay,</i> Harry thought to his Patronus, which took up a
position just to one side of the door, as though guarding it; and
then Harry pushed the door open further, and followed within.</p>
<p>The first cell Harry looked at contained a dessicated corpse,
skin gone grey and mottled, flesh worn through in places to expose
the bone beneath, no eyes -</p>
<p>Harry shut his eyes. He could still do that, he was still
invisible, he wasn't betraying anything by shutting his eyes.</p>
<p>He'd known it already, he'd read it on page six of his
Transfiguration book, that you stayed in Azkaban until your prison
term was done. If you died before it was up they kept you there
until they released your corpse. If your term was for life, they
just left the body in the cell until the cell was needed, at which
point they threw your body into the Dementors' pit. But it was
still a shock to see, that corpse had been a <i>person</i> who'd
just been <i>left</i> there -</p>
<p>The light in the room wavered.</p>
<p><i>Steady,</i> thought Harry in his core. It wouldn't be good
for Professor Quirrell if that Patronus went out from his thinking
sad thoughts. This near to the Dementors the Defense Professor
might just fall dead where he stood. <i>Steady, Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres, steady!</i></p>
<p>With that thought, Harry opened his eyes again, there wasn't
time to waste.</p>
<p>The second cell he looked at contained only a skeleton.</p>
<p>And behind the bars of the third cell he saw Bellatrix
Black.</p>
<p>Something precious and irreplaceable inside Harry withered like
dry grass.</p>
<p>You could tell the woman wasn't a skeleton, that her head wasn't
a skull, because the texture of skin was still different from the
texture of bone, no matter how white and pale she'd become, waiting
in the dark alone. Either they weren't feeding her much, or what
she ate, the shadows of Death drained from her; for her eyes seemed
shrunken below their lids, her lips looked too shriveled to close
over her teeth. The color seemed leached out of the black clothing
she had worn into prison, like the Dementors had drained that too.
They'd been meant to be daring, those clothes, and now they lay
loosely over a skeleton, exposing shriveled skin.</p>
<p><i>I'm here to save her, I'm here to save her, I'm here to save
her,</i> Harry thought to himself, desperately, over and over with
an effort like Occlumency, willing his Patronus not to go out, to
stay and <i>protect Bellatrix from the Dementors</i> -</p>
<p>In his heart, in his core, Harry held to all his pity and his
compassion, his will to save her from the darkness; the silver
radiance coming in through the open door brightened, even as he
thought it.</p>
<p>And in another part of him, like he was just letting another
part of his mind carry out a habit without paying much attention to
it...</p>
<p>A cold expression came over Harry's face, invisibly beneath the
hood.</p>
<p>"Hello, my dear Bella," said a chill whisper. "Did you miss
me?"</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="53">Chapter 53</h2><h3>The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 3</h3>
<p>The corpse of a woman opened her eyes, and the dull sunken orbs
gazed out at nothing.</p>
<p>"Mad," Bellatrix muttered in a cracked voice, "It seems that
little Bella is going mad..."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had instructed Harry, calmly and precisely,
how he was to act in Bellatrix's presence; how to form the pretense
he would maintain in his mind.</p>
<p><i>You found it expedient, or perhaps just amusing, to make
Bellatrix fall in love with you, to bind her to your
service.</i></p>
<p>That love would have persisted through Azkaban, Professor
Quirrell had said, because to Bellatrix it would not be a happy
thought.</p>
<p><i>She loves you utterly, completely, with her whole being. You
do not return her love, but consider her useful. She knows
this.</i></p>
<p><i>She was the deadliest weapon you possessed, and you called
her your dear Bella.</i></p>
<p>Harry remembered it from the night the Dark Lord killed his
parents: the cold amusement, the contemptuous laughter, that
high-pitched voice of deathly hate. It didn't seem at all difficult
to guess what the Dark Lord would say.</p>
<p>"I hope you are <i>not</i> mad, Bella dear," said the chill
whisper. "Mad is not useful."</p>
<p>Bellatrix's eyes flickered, tried to focus on empty air.</p>
<p>"My... Lord... I waited for you but you did not come... I looked
for you but I could not find you... you are alive..." All her words
came out in a low mutter, if there was emotion in it, Harry could
not tell.</p>
<p>"<i>Sshow her your face,</i>" hissed the snake at Harry's
feet.</p>
<p>Harry cast back the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility.</p>
<p>The part of him that Harry had placed in control of his facial
expressions looked at Bella without the slightest trace of pity,
only cool, calm interest. (While in his core, Harry thought, <i>I
will save you, I will save you no matter what...</i>)</p>
<p>"The scar..." muttered Bellatrix. "That child..."</p>
<p>"So they all still think," said Harry's voice, and gave a thin
little chuckle. "You looked for me in the wrong place, Bella
dear."</p>
<p>(Harry had asked why Professor Quirrell couldn't be the one to
play the part of the Dark Lord, and Professor Quirrell had pointed
out that there was no plausible reason for <i>him</i> to be
possessed by the shade of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.)</p>
<p>Bellatrix's eyes remained fixed on Harry, she said no word.</p>
<p><i>"Ssay ssomething in Parsseltongue,"</i> hissed the snake.</p>
<p>Harry's face turned to the snake, to make it clear that he was
addressing it, and hissed, "<i>One two three four five ssix sseven
eight nine ten.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Those who do not fear the darkness..." murmured Bellatrix.</p>
<p>The snake hissed, "<i>Will be conssumed by it.</i>"</p>
<p>"Will be consumed by it," whispered the chill voice. Harry
didn't particularly want to think about how Professor Quirrell had
gotten that password. His brain, which thought about it anyway,
suggested that it had probably involved a Death Eater, a quiet
isolated place, and some lead-pipe Legilimency.</p>
<p>"Your wand," murmured Bellatrix, "I took it from the Potters'
house and hid it, my lord... under the tombstone to the right of
your father's grave... will you kill me, now, if that was all you
wished of me... I think I must have always wanted you to be the one
to kill me... but I can't remember now, it must have been a happy
thought..."</p>
<p>Harry's heart wrenched inside him, it was unbearable, and - and
he couldn't cry, couldn't let his Patronus fade -</p>
<p>Harry's face showed a flicker of annoyance, and his voice was
sharp as it said, "Enough foolishness. You're to come with me,
Bella dear, unless you prefer the company of the Dementors."</p>
<p>Bellatrix's face twitched in brief puzzlement, the shrunken
limbs did not stir.</p>
<p>"<i>You'll need to float her out,</i>" Harry hissed to the
snake. "<i>Sshe can no longer think of
esscaping.</i>"<i><br /></i></p>
<p>"<i>Yess,</i>" hissed the snake, "<i>but do not underesstimate
her, sshe wass the deadliesst of warriorss.</i>" The green head
dipped in warning. "<i>One would be wisse to fear me, boy, even
were I sstarved and nine-tenthss dead; be wary of her, allow no
ssingle flaw in your pretensse.</i>"</p>
<p>The green snake smoothly glided out of the door.</p>
<p>And shortly after, a man with sallow skin and a fearful
expression on his bearded face cringed into the room with his wand
in hand.</p>
<p>"My Lord?" the servant said falteringly.</p>
<p>"Do as you were instructed," the Dark Lord whispered in that
chill voice, sounding even more terrible coming from a child's
body. "And do not let your Patronus falter. Remember, if I do not
return there will be no reward for you, and it will be long before
your family is allowed to die."</p>
<p>Having spoken those dreadful words, the Dark Lord pulled his
invisibility cloak over his head, and disappeared.</p>
<p>The cringing servant opened the door to Bellatrix's cage, and
pulled a tiny needle from his robes with which he poked the human
skeleton. The single drop of red blood produced was soon absorbed
into a small doll, which was laid upon the floor, and the servant
began to chant in a whisper.</p>
<p>Soon another living skeleton lay upon the floor, motionless.
Afterward the servant seemed to hesitate for a moment, until from
the empty air hissed an impatient command. Then the servant pointed
his wand at Bellatrix and spoke a word, and the living skeleton
lying on the bed was naked, and the skeleton lying on the floor was
clothed in her faded dress.</p>
<p>The servant tore a small strip of cloth from the dress, as it
lay upon the seeming corpse; and from his own robes, the fearful
man then produced an empty glass flask with small traces of golden
fluid clinging to its inside. This flask was concealed in a corner,
the strip of skirt laid over it, the leached cloth nearly blending
with the gray metal wall.</p>
<p>Another wave of the servant's wand floated the human skeleton
lying on the bed into the air, and in almost the same motion
clothed her in new black robes. An ordinary-looking bottle of
chocolate milk was put into her hand, and a chill whisper ordered
Bellatrix to grasp the bottle and begin drinking it, which she did,
her face still looking only puzzled.</p>
<p>Then the servant turned Bellatrix invisible, and turned himself
invisible, and they left. The door closed behind them all and
clicked as it locked, plunging the corridor into darkness once
more, unchanged but for a small flask concealed in the corner of
one cell, and a fresh corpse lying upon its floor.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Earlier, in the deserted shop, Professor Quirrell had told Harry
that they were going to commit the perfect crime.</p>
<p>Harry had unthinkingly started to repeat back the standard
proverb that there was no such thing as a perfect crime, before he
actually thought about it for two-thirds of a second, remembered a
wiser proverb, and shut his mouth in midsentence.</p>
<p><i>What do you think you know, and how do you think you know
it?</i></p>
<p>If you <i>did</i> commit the perfect crime, nobody would ever
find out - so how could anyone possibly <i>know</i> that there
weren't perfect crimes?</p>
<p>And as soon as you looked at it that way, you realized that
perfect crimes probably got committed <i>all the time</i>, and the
coroner marked it down as death by natural causes, or the newspaper
reported that the shop had never been very profitable and had
finally gone out of business...</p>
<p>When Bellatrix Black's corpse was found dead in her cell the
next morning, there within the prison of Azkaban from which
(everyone knew) no one had ever escaped, nobody bothered doing an
autopsy. Nobody thought twice about it. They just locked up the
corridor and left, and the <i>Daily Prophet</i> reported it in the
obituary column the next day...</p>
<p>...that was the perfect crime which Professor Quirrell had
planned.</p>
<p>And it wasn't Professor Quirrell who screwed it up.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="54">Chapter 54</h2><h3>The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 4</h3>
<p>A faint green spark moved forward to set the pace, and behind it
followed a brilliant silver figure, all other entities invisible.
They had traversed five legs of corridor, turned right five times
and gone up five flights of stairs; and when Bellatrix had finished
her second bottle of chocolate milk, she had been given solid bars
of chocolate to eat.</p>
<p>It was after her third bar of chocolate that strange noises
began to come from Bellatrix's throat.</p>
<p>It took a moment for Harry to understand, to process the sounds,
it didn't sound like anything he'd ever heard before; the rhythm of
it was shattered, almost unrecognizable, it took him that long to
realize that Bellatrix was crying.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black was crying, the Dark Lord's most terrible weapon
was crying, she was invisible but you could hear it, tiny pathetic
sounds she was trying to suppress, even now.</p>
<p>"It's real?" said Bellatrix. Tonality had returned into her
voice, no longer a dead mutter, it rose up at the end to form the
question. "It's real?"</p>
<p><i>Yes,</i> thought the part of Harry simulating the Dark Lord,
<i>now be silent</i> -</p>
<p>He couldn't make those words pass his lips, he just
couldn't.</p>
<p>"I knew - you would - come to me - someday," Bellatrix's voice
quavered and fractured as she drew breath for quiet sobs, "I knew -
you were alive - that you would come - to me - my Lord..." there
was a long inhalation like a huge gasp, "and that even - when you
came - you still wouldn't love me - never - you would never love me
back - that was why - they couldn't take - my love from me - even
though I can't remember - can't remember so many other things -
though I don't know what I forgot - but I remember how much I love
you, Lord -"</p>
<p>There was a knife stabbing through Harry's heart, he'd never
heard anything so terrible, he wanted to hunt down the Dark Lord
and kill him just for this...</p>
<p>"Do you still - have use for me - my Lord?"</p>
<p>"No," hissed Harry's voice, without him even thinking, it just
seemed to be operating on automatic, "I entered Azkaban on a whim.
Of course I have use for you! Don't ask foolish questions."</p>
<p>"But - I'm weak," said Bellatrix's voice, and a full sob escaped
her, it sounded much too loud in the corridors of Azkaban, "I can't
kill for you, my Lord, I'm sorry, they ate it all, ate me all up,
I'm too weak to fight, what good am I to you now -"</p>
<p>Harry's brain cast about desperately for some way to reassure
her, from the lips of a Dark Lord who would never speak a single
word of caring.</p>
<p>"Ugly," said Bellatrix. Her voice said that word like it was the
final nail in her coffin, the last despair. "I'm ugly, they ate
that too, I'm, I'm not pretty any more, you won't even, be able, to
use me, as a reward, for your servants - even the Lestranges, won't
want, to hurt me, any more -"</p>
<p>The brilliant silver figure stopped walking.</p>
<p>Because Harry had stopped walking.</p>
<p><i>The Dark Lord, he...</i> The part of Harry's self that was
soft and vulnerable was screaming in disbelieving horror, trying to
reject reality, refuse the understanding, even as a colder and
harder part completed the pattern: <i>She obeyed him in that as she
obeyed him in all things.</i></p>
<p>The green spark bobbed urgently, darted forward.</p>
<p>The silver humanoid stayed in place.</p>
<p>Bellatrix was sobbing harder.</p>
<p>"I'm, I'm not, I can't be, useful, any more..."</p>
<p>Giant hands were squeezing Harry's chest, wringing him like a
washcloth, trying to crush his heart.</p>
<p>"Please," whispered Bellatrix, "just kill me..." Her voice
seemed to calm, once she said that. "Please Lord, kill me, I've no
reason to live if I'm no use to you... I only want it to stop...
please hurt me one last time, my Lord, hurt me until I stop... I
love you..."</p>
<p>It was the saddest thing Harry had ever heard.</p>
<p>The bright silver shape of Harry's Patronus flickered -</p>
<p>Wavered -</p>
<p>Brightened -</p>
<p>The fury that was rising in Harry, his rage against the Dark
Lord who had done this, the rage against the Dementors, against
Azkaban, against the world that allowed such horror, it all seemed
to be pouring straight through his arm and into his wand without
there being any way of blocking it, he tried willing it to stop and
nothing happened.</p>
<p>"My Lord!" whispered the disguised voice of Professor Quirrell.
"My spell is going out of control! Help me, my Lord!"</p>
<p>Brighter the Patronus, brighter and brighter, it was waxing
faster than on the day that Harry had destroyed a Dementor.</p>
<p>"My Lord!" the silhouette said in a terrified whisper. "Help me!
Everyone will feel it, my Lord!"</p>
<p><i>Everyone will feel it,</i> thought Harry. His imagination
could picture it clearly, the prisoners in their cells stirring as
the cold and darkness fell away, replaced by healing light.</p>
<p>Every exposed surface now burned like a white sun in the
reflections, the silhouette of Bellatrix's skeleton and the sallow
man now clearly visible in the blaze, the Disillusionment spells
unable to keep pace with the unearthly brilliance; only the Cloak
of Invisibility out of the Deathly Hallows withstood it.</p>
<p>"My Lord! <i>You must stop it!</i>"</p>
<p>But Harry could no longer will it to stop, he no longer wanted
it to stop. He could sense it, more and more of the sparks of life
in Azkaban being sheltered by his Patronus, <i>as it unfolded like
spreading wings of sunlight, the air turned to absolute silver as
he thought it, Harry knew what he had to do.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Please, my Lord!</i>"</p>
<p>The words went unheard.</p>
<p><i>They were far from him, the Dementors in their pit, but Harry
knew that they could be destroyed even at this distance if the
light blazed bright enough, he knew that Death itself could not
face him if he stopped holding back, so he unsealed all the gates
inside him and sank the wells of his spell into all the deepest
parts of his spirit, all his mind and all his will, and gave over
absolutely everything to the spell -</i></p>
<p>And in the interior of the Sun, an only slightly dimmer shadow
moved forward, reaching out an entreating hand.</p>
<p><i>WRONG<br />
DON'T</i></p>
<p>The sudden sense of doom clashed with Harry's steel
determination, dread and uncertainty striving against the bright
purpose, nothing else might have reached him but that. The
silhouette took another step forward and another, the sense of doom
rising to a point of terrible catastrophe; and in the drench of
cold water, Harry saw it, he realized the consequences of what he
was doing, the danger and the trap.</p>
<p>If you had been watching from outside you would have seen the
interior of the Sun brightening and dimming...</p>
<p>Brightening and dimming...</p>
<p>...and finally fading, fading, fading into ordinary moonlight
that seemed like pitch darkness by contrast.</p>
<p>Within the darkness of that moonlight stood a sallow man with
his hand outstretched in entreaty, and the skeleton of a woman,
lying upon the floor, a puzzled look upon her face.</p>
<p>And Harry, still invisible, fallen to his knees. The greater
danger had passed, and now Harry was just trying not to collapse,
to keep the spell going at the lower level. He'd drained something,
hopefully not lost something <i>-</i> he should have known, should
have remembered, that it wasn't mere magic that fueled the Patronus
Charm -</p>
<p>"Thank you, my Lord," whispered the sallow man.</p>
<p>"Fool," said the hard voice of a boy pretending to be a Dark
Lord. "Did I not warn you that the spell could prove fatal if you
failed to control your emotions?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's eyes did not widen, of course.</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord, I understand," said the Dark Lord's servant in a
faltering voice, and turned to Bellatrix -</p>
<p>She was already pushing herself off the floor, slowly, like an
old, old Muggle woman. "How funny," Bellatrix whispered, "you were
almost killed by a Patronus Charm..." A giggle that sounded like it
was blowing dust out of her giggle pipes. "I could punish you,
maybe, if my Lord froze you in place and I had knives... maybe I
can be useful after all? Oh, I feel a little better now, how
strange..."</p>
<p>"Be silent, dear Bella," Harry said in a chill voice, "until I
give you leave to speak."</p>
<p>There was no reply, which was obedience.</p>
<p>The servant levitated the human skeleton, and made her invisible
once more, followed shortly by his own disappearance with the sound
of another cracking egg.</p>
<p>They passed on through the corridors of Azkaban.</p>
<p>And Harry knew that as they passed, the prisoners were stirring
in their cells as the fear lifted for one precious moment, maybe
even feeling a small touch of healing as his light passed them by,
and then collapsing down again as the cold and darkness pressed
back in.</p>
<p>Harry was trying very hard not to think about it.</p>
<p>Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every
Dementor in Azkaban, blazing bright enough to destroy them even at
this distance...</p>
<p>Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every
Dementor in Azkaban, taking all of Harry's life as fuel.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In the Auror's quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio
was snoring in the barracks, one Auror trio was resting in the
breakroom, and one Auror trio was on duty in the command room,
keeping their watch. The command room was simple but large, with
three chairs at back where three Aurors sat, their wands always in
hand to sustain their three Patronuses, as the bright white forms
paced in front of the open window, sheltering them all from the
Dementors' fear.</p>
<p>The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker,
and didn't look out the window. You could have seen some sky there,
sure, and there was even an hour or two every day where you
could've seen some sun, but that window also looked down on the
central pit of hell.</p>
<p>Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you.</p>
<p>There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty
here, triple pay or no triple pay, if he hadn't had a family to
support. (His real name was Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike
instead; he'd named his children Su and Kao, which hopefully would
serve them better.) His only consolation, besides the money, was
that at least his mates played an excellent game of Dragon Poker.
Though it would be hard <i>not</i> to, at this point.</p>
<p>It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his
best hand of the 5300s. It was a Saturday in February and there
were three players, which let him shift the suit of any one hole
card except a two, three, or seven; and that was enough to let him
build a Corps-a-Corps with Unicorns, Dragons, and sevens...</p>
<p>Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the
table cards toward the direction of the window, staring.</p>
<p>The sinking feeling came over Li's stomach with surprising
speed.</p>
<p>If his seven of hearts got hit by a Dementor Modifier and turned
into a six, he was going straight down to two pair and McCusker
might beat that -</p>
<p>"Mike," said McCusker, "what's with your Patronus?"</p>
<p>Li turned his head and looked.</p>
<p>His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the
pit and was staring downward at something only it could see.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bahry's moonlit duck and McCusker's bright
anteater followed suit, staring in the same downward direction.</p>
<p>They all exchanged glances, and then sighed.</p>
<p>"I'll tell them," said Bahry. Protocol called for sending the
three Aurors who were off-duty but not sleeping to investigate
anything anomalous. "Maybe relieve one of them and take the C
spiral, if you two don't mind."</p>
<p>Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded. It
wasn't too hard to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough
to hire a powerful wizard, and well-intentioned enough to recruit
someone who could cast the Patronus Charm. People with friends in
Azkaban would do that, break in just to give someone a half-day's
worth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams instead of
nightmares. Leave them a supply of chocolate to conceal in their
cell, to increase the chance they lived through their sentence. And
the Aurors on guard... well, even if you got caught, you could
probably convince the Aurors to overlook it, in exchange for the
right bribe.</p>
<p>For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts
and a silver Sickle. He hated this place.</p>
<p>But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer's bills,
and if you could afford to hire someone who could break into
Azkaban, then you could afford to grease Bahry's remaining palm
pretty hard, if he was the one who caught you.</p>
<p>By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by
being the first to propose it, the three of them finished out their
poker hand first. Li won, since no Dementors had actually shown up.
And by then the Patronuses had stopped staring and gone back to
their normal patrol, so it was probably nothing, but procedure was
procedure.</p>
<p>After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and
stood up from the table. The older man's long white locks brushed
against his fancy red robes, his robes brushed the metal floor of
the command room, as Bahry went through the separating door that
led to the formerly off-duty Aurors.</p>
<p>Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a
little queasy about this kind of business. But Bahry had shown them
all the pictures, and you had to let a man do what he could for his
poor sick wife, especially when he only had seven months left
before his retirement.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The faint green spark floated through the metal corridors, and
the silver humanoid, seeming a little dimmer now, followed after
it. Sometimes the bright figure would flare, especially when they
passed one of the huge metal doors, but it always died back down
again.</p>
<p>Mere eyes could not have seen the invisible others: the
eleven-year-old Boy-Who-Lived, and the living skeleton that was
Bellatrix Black, and the Polyjuiced Defense Professor of Hogwarts,
all traveling together through Azkaban. If that was the beginning
of a joke, Harry didn't know the punchline.</p>
<p>They'd gone up another four flights of stairs before the rough
voice of the Defense Professor said, simply and without emphasis,
"Auror coming."</p>
<p>It took too long, a whole second maybe, for Harry to understand,
for the jolt of adrenaline to pump into his blood, and for him to
remember what Professor Quirrell had already discussed with him and
told him to do in this case, and then Harry spun on his heel and
flew back the way they'd come.</p>
<p>Harry reached the flight of stairs, and frantically laid himself
down on the third step from the top, the cold metal feeling hard
even through his cloak and robes. Trying to move his head up, to
peer over the lip of the stairs, showed that he couldn't see
Professor Quirrell; and that meant that Harry was out of the line
of any stray fire.</p>
<p>His shining Patronus followed after him, and lay down beside him
on the step just beneath him; for it too must not be seen.</p>
<p>There was a faint sound as of wind or whooshing, and then the
sound of Bellatrix's invisible body coming to rest on a stair
further below, she had no place in this except -</p>
<p>"Stay still," said the cold high whisper, "stay silent."</p>
<p>There was stillness, and silence.</p>
<p>Harry pressed his wand against the side of the metal step just
above him. If he was anyone else he would have needed to take a
Knut out of his pocket... or rip off a bit of cloth from his
robe... or bite off one of his nails... or find a speck of rock
large enough that he could see it and solid enough to stay in one
place and orientation while it touched his wand. But with Harry's
almighty power of partial Transfiguration, this was not necessary;
he could skip that particular step of the operation and use any
material near to hand.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved
mirror, and...</p>
<p>"<i>Wingardium Leviosa,</i>" Harry whispered as quietly as he
could.</p>
<p>...was levitating it just above the steps, and watching, in that
curved surface, almost the whole corridor where Professor Quirrell
invisibly waited.</p>
<p>Harry heard it in the distance, then, the sound of
footsteps.</p>
<p>And saw the form (a little hard to see in the mirror) of a
person in red robes, coming down the stairs, entering the seemingly
empty corridor; accompanied by a small Patronus animal that Harry
couldn't quite make out.</p>
<p>The Auror was protected by a blue shimmer, it was hard to see
the details but Harry could see that much, the Auror had shields
already raised and strengthened.</p>
<p><i>Crap,</i> thought Harry. According to the Defense Professor,
the essential art of dueling consisted of trying to put up defenses
that would block whatever someone was likely to throw at you, while
trying in turn to attack in ways that were likely to go past their
current set of defenses. And by far the easiest way to win any sort
of real fight - Professor Quirrell had said this over and over -
was to shoot the enemy before they raised a shield in the first
place, either from behind or from close enough range that they
couldn't dodge or counter in time.</p>
<p>Though Professor Quirrell might still be able to get in a shot
from behind, if -</p>
<p>But the Auror halted after taking three steps into the
corridor.</p>
<p>"Nice Disillusionment," said a hard male voice that Harry didn't
recognize. "Now show yourself, or you'll be in <i>real</i>
trouble."</p>
<p>The form of the sallow, bearded man became visible then.</p>
<p>"And you with the Patronus," said the hard voice. "Come out too.
<i>Now.</i>"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be smart," said the gravelly voice of the sallow man.
It was no longer the terrified voice of the Dark Lord's servant; it
had suddenly become the professional intimidation of a competent
criminal. "You don't want to see who's behind me. Trust me, you
don't. Five hundred Galleons, cold cash up front, if you turn
around and walk away. Big trouble for your career if you
don't."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"Look, whoever you are," said the hard voice. "You seem confused
about how this works. I don't care if that's Lucius Malfoy behind
you or Albus bloody Dumbledore. You <i>all</i> come out, I scan the
whole lot of you, and <i>then</i> we talk about how much this is
going to cost you -"</p>
<p>"Two thousand Galleons, final offer," said the gravelly voice,
taking on a warning undertone. "That's ten times the going rate and
more than you make in a year. And believe me, if you see something
you shouldn't, you're going to regret not taking that -"</p>
<p>"Shut it!" said the hard voice. "You've got exactly five seconds
to drop that wand before I drop you. Five, four -"</p>
<p><i>What are you doing, Professor Quirrell?</i> Harry thought
frantically. <i>Attack first! Cast a shield at least!</i></p>
<p>"- three, two, one! <i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Bahry stared, a chill running down his spine.</p>
<p>The man's wand had moved so fast that it was like it had
Apparated into place, and Bahry's stunner was currently sparkling
tamely at the end of it, not blocked, not countered, not deflected,
<i>caught</i> like a fly in honey.</p>
<p>"My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons," said the
man in a colder, more formal voice. He smiled dryly, and the smile
looked wrong on that bearded face. "And you shall need to accept a
Memory Charm."</p>
<p>Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that
his own stunner couldn't pass back through, already tilted his wand
back into a defensive position, already raised his hardened
artificial hand into position to block anything blockable, and was
already thinking wordless spells to put more layers on his shields
-</p>
<p>The man wasn't looking at Bahry. Instead he was poking curiously
at Bahry's stunner where it still wavered on the end of his wand,
drawing out red sparks and flicking them away with his fingers,
slowly disassembling the hex like a child's rod puzzle.</p>
<p>The man hadn't raised any shields of his own.</p>
<p>"Tell me," the man said in a disinterested voice that didn't
seem to quite fit the rough throat - Polyjuice, Bahry would have
called it, if he'd thought that anyone could possibly do magic that
delicate from inside someone else's body - "what did you do in the
last war? Put yourself in harm's way, or stay out of trouble?"</p>
<p>"Harm's way," said Bahry. His voice kept the iron calm of an
Auror with nearly a hundred full years on the force, seven months
short of mandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody couldn't have said it
with any more hardness.</p>
<p>"Fight any Death Eaters?"</p>
<p>Now a grim smile graced Bahry's own face. "Two at once." Two of
You-Know-Who's own warrior-assassins, personally trained by their
dark master. Two Death Eaters at once against Bahry alone. It had
been the toughest fight of Bahry's life, but he'd stood his ground,
and walked away with only the loss of his left hand.</p>
<p>"Did you kill them?" The man sounded idly curious, and he
continued to draw threads of fire out of the much-diminished
stunbolt still captive on the end of his wand, his fingers now
weaving small patterns of Bahry's own magic before flicking to
disperse them.</p>
<p>Sweat broke out on Bahry's skin beneath his robes. His metal
hand flashed downward, ripped the mirror from his belt - "Bahry to
Mike, I need backup!"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and silence.</p>
<p>"Bahry to Mike!"</p>
<p>The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand. Slowly, Bahry put
it back on his belt.</p>
<p>"It's been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a
serious opponent," the man said, still not looking up at Bahry.
"Try not to disappoint me too much. You can attack whenever you're
ready. Or you can walk away with five hundred Galleons."</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>Then the air screamed like metal cutting glass as Bahry slashed
his wand downward.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make out anything amid
the lights and flashes, his mirror's curve was perfect (they'd
practiced that tactic before in the Chaos Legion) but the scene was
still too small, and Harry had the feeling he wouldn't be able to
understand even if he was watching from a meter away, it was all
happening too <i>fast,</i> red blasts deflecting from blue shields,
green bars of light clashing together, shadowy forms appearing and
vanishing, he couldn't even tell who was casting what, except that
the Auror was shouting incantation after incantation and
frantically dodging while Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form
stood in one place and flicked his wand, mostly silently, but now
and then pronouncing words in unrecognizable languages that would
white out the whole mirror and show half the Auror's shielding torn
away as he staggered back.</p>
<p>Harry had seen exhibition duels between the strongest
seventh-year students, and this was so far above it that Harry's
mind felt numbed, looking at how far he had left to go. There
wasn't a single seventh-year student who could have lasted half a
minute against the Auror, all three seventh-year armies put
together might not be able to scratch the Defense Professor...</p>
<p>The Auror had fallen to the ground, one knee and one hand
supporting himself as the other hand gestured frantically and his
mouth shouted desperate words, the few incantations that Harry
recognized were all shield spells, as a flock of shadows spun
around the Auror like a whirlwind of razors.</p>
<p>And Harry saw Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form deliberately
point his wand at where the Auror kneeled and fought the last
moments of his battle.</p>
<p>"Surrender," said the gravelly voice.</p>
<p>The Auror spat something unspeakable.</p>
<p>"In that case," said the voice, "<i>Avada</i> -"</p>
<p>Time seemed to move very slowly, like there was time to hear the
individual syllables, <i>Ke,</i> and <i>Da,</i> and <i>Vra,</i>
time to watch the Auror starting to throw himself desperately
aside; and even though it was all happening so slowly, somehow
there wasn't time to <i>do</i> anything, no time for Harry to open
his lips and scream <i>NO</i>, no time to move, maybe even not any
time to think.</p>
<p>Only time for one desperate wish that an innocent man should not
die <i>-</i></p>
<p>And a blazing silver figure stood before the Auror.</p>
<p>Stood there just a fraction of a second before the green light
struck home.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Bahry was twisting frantically aside, not knowing if he was
going to make it -</p>
<p>His eyes were focused on his opponent and his onrushing death,
so Bahry only briefly saw the outline of the brilliant silhouette,
the Patronus brighter than any he'd ever seen, saw it just barely
long enough to recognize the impossible shape, before the green and
the silver light collided and both lights vanished, <i>both</i>
lights vanished, <i>the Killing Curse had been blocked</i>, and
then Bahry's ears were pierced as he saw his terrible opponent
screaming, screaming, screaming, clutching at his head and
screaming, starting to fall as Bahry was already falling -</p>
<p>Bahry hit the ground, falling from his own frantic lunge, and
his dislocated left shoulder and broken rib screamed in protest.
Bahry ignored the pain, managed to scramble back to his knees,
brought up his wand to stun his opponent, he didn't understand what
was happening but he knew that this was his only chance.</p>
<p>"<i>Stupefy!</i>"</p>
<p>The red bolt struck out toward the man's falling body, and was
torn apart in midair and dissipated - and not by any shield. Bahry
could <i>see</i> it, the wavering in the air that surrounded his
fallen and screaming opponent.</p>
<p>Bahry could feel it like a deadly pressure on his skin, the flux
of magic building and building and building toward some terrible
breaking point. His instincts screamed at him to run before the
explosion came, this was no Charm, no Curse, this was wizardry run
wild, but before Bahry could even finish getting to his feet -</p>
<p>The man threw his wand away from himself (he threw away his
wand!) and a second later, his form blurred and vanished
entirely.</p>
<p>A green snake lay motionless on the ground, unmoving even before
Bahry's next stunner spell, fired in sheer reflex, hit it without
resistance.</p>
<p>As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the
wild wizardry died back down, Bahry's dazed mind noticed that the
scream was continuing. Only it sounded different, like the scream
of a young boy, coming from the stairs leading down to the next
lower level.</p>
<p>That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except
for Bahry's frantic panting.</p>
<p>His thoughts were slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent had
been <i>insanely</i> powerful, that hadn't been a duel, it had been
like his first year as a trainee Auror trying to fight Madam Tarma.
The Death-Eaters hadn't been a tenth that good, Mad-Eye Moody
wasn't that good... and who, what, how in the name of Merlin's
balls had anyone blocked a <i>Killing Curse?</i></p>
<p>Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against his
rib, mutter the healing spell, and then press it again to his
shoulder. It took more out of him than it should have, took far too
much out of him, his magic was within a bare breath of utter
exhaustion; he didn't have anything left for his minor cuts and
bruises or even to reinforce the scraps left of his shielding. It
was all he could do not to let his Patronus go out.</p>
<p>Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied his breath as much as
he could before he spoke.</p>
<p>"You," Bahry said. "Whoever you are. Come out."</p>
<p>There was silence, and it occurred to Bahry that whoever it was
might be unconscious. He didn't understand what had just happened,
but he'd heard the scream...</p>
<p>Well, there was one way to test that.</p>
<p>"Come out," said Bahry, making his voice harder, "or I start
using area-effect curses." He probably couldn't have managed one if
he'd tried.</p>
<p>"Wait," said a boy's voice, a <i>young</i> boy's voice, high and
thin and wavering, like someone was holding back exhaustion or
tears. The voice now seemed to be coming from closer to hand.
"Please wait. I'm - coming out -"</p>
<p>"Drop the invisibility," growled Bahry. He was too tired to
bother with anti-Disillusionment Charms.</p>
<p>A moment later, a young boy's face emerged from within an
unfolding invisibility cloak, and Bahry saw the black hair, the
green eyes, the glasses, and the angry red lightning-bolt scar.</p>
<p>If he'd had twenty fewer years of experience under his belt he
might have blinked. Instead he just spat something that he probably
shouldn't ought to say in front of the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>"He, he," the boy's wavering voice said, his young face looked
frightened and exhausted and tears were still trickling down his
cheeks, "he kidnapped me, to make me cast my Patronus... he said
he'd kill me if I didn't... only I couldn't let him just kill
you..."</p>
<p>Bahry's mind was still dazed, but things were slowly starting to
click into place.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to survive a Killing Curse.
Bahry might have been able to dodge the green death, he'd certainly
been trying, but if the matter came up before the Wizengamot,
they'd rule it was a life debt to a Noble House.</p>
<p>"I see," Bahry said in a much gentler growl. He started to walk
toward the boy. "Son, I'm sorry for what you've been through, but I
need you to drop the cloak and drop your wand."</p>
<p>The rest of Harry Potter emerged from invisibility, showing the
sweat-soaked blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, and his right hand
clutching an eleven-inch holly wand so hard his knuckles were
white.</p>
<p>"Your wand," Bahry repeated.</p>
<p>"Sorry," whispered the eleven-year-old boy, "here," and he held
out the wand toward Bahry.</p>
<p>Bahry barely stopped himself from snarling at the traumatized
boy who'd just saved his life. Instead he overrode the impulse with
a sigh, and just stretched out a hand to take the wand. "Look, son,
you're <i>really</i> not supposed to point a wand at -"</p>
<p>The wand's end twisted lightly beneath Bahry's hand just as the
boy whispered, "<i>Somnium</i>."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry stared at the Auror's crumpled body, there was no sense of
triumph, just a crushing sense of despair.</p>
<p>(Even then it might not have been too late.)</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at where the green snake lay
motionless.</p>
<p>"<i>Teacher?</i>" hissed Harry. "<i>Friend? Pleasse, are you
alive?</i>" An awful fear was taking hold in Harry's heart; in
that moment he had entirely forgotten that he'd just seen the
Defense Professor try to kill a police officer.</p>
<p>Harry pointed his wand at the snake, and his lips even began to
shape the word <i>Innervate</i>, before his brain caught up with
him and screamed at him.</p>
<p>He didn't dare use magic on Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>Harry had felt it, the burning, tearing pain in his head, like
his brain was about to split in half. He'd felt it, his magic and
Professor Quirrell's magic, matched and anti-harmonized in a
fulfillment of doom. That was the mysterious terrible thing that
would happen if Harry and Professor Quirrell ever got too close to
each other, or if they ever cast magic on each other, or if
<i>their spells ever touched,</i> their magic would resonate out of
control -</p>
<p>Harry stared at the snake, he couldn't tell if it was
breathing.</p>
<p>(The last seconds ticked away.)</p>
<p>He turned to stare at the Auror, who had seen the Boy-Who-Lived,
who knew.</p>
<p>The full magnitude of the disaster crushed in on Harry like a
thousand hundred-ton weights, he'd managed to stun the Auror but
now there was nothing left to do, no way to recover, the mission
had failed, everything had failed, <i>he</i> had failed.</p>
<p>Shocked, dismayed, despairing, he <i>didn't think of it</i>,
didn't see the obvious, didn't remember where the hopeless feelings
were coming from, didn't realize that he still needed to recast the
True Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>(And then it was already too late.)</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Auror Li and Auror McCusker had rearranged their chairs around
the table, and so they both saw it at the same time, the naked,
skeletally thin horror rising up to hover outside the window, the
headache already hitting them from seeing it.</p>
<p>They both heard the voice, like a long-dead corpse had spoken
words and those words themselves had aged and died.</p>
<p>The Dementor's speech hurt their ears as it said, "Bellatrix
Black is out of her cell."</p>
<p>There was a split second of horrified silence, and then Li tore
out of his chair, heading for the communicator to call in
reinforcements from the Ministry, even as McCusker grabbed his
mirror and started frantically trying to raise the three Aurors
who'd gone on patrol.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="55">Chapter 55</h2><h3>The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 5</h3>
<p>In a scarred and ruined corridor, lit by dim gas lights, a boy
slowly crept forward, one hand stretched out, toward the unmoving
snake that was the body of his teacher.</p>
<p>Harry was only a meter away from the snake's body when he first
felt it, tickling at the edge of his perception.</p>
<p>Ever so weakly, a sense of doom...</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell <i>was</i> alive, then.</p>
<p>The thought engendered no feeling of joy, only a sort of empty
despair.</p>
<p>Harry would still be caught soon, and no matter how he tried to
explain, it still wouldn't look good. No one would trust him again,
they would think he was the next Dark Lord, they wouldn't help him
when it came time to fight Lord Voldemort, Hermione would give up
on him, probably even Dumbledore would look for another hero...</p>
<p>...maybe they'd just send him home to his parents.</p>
<p>He had failed.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the crumpled body of the police officer he'd
stunned, the already-drying blood from the minor cuts and slashes,
the burned places on the intricately embroidered red robes.</p>
<p>He'd been stupid. He <i>shouldn't</i> have stunned the police
officer, should have just <i>stayed</i> with his original story
about being kidnapped by Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p><i>It might not be too late,</i> whispered a voice inside him.
<i>You might still be able to fix your mistake. The Auror saw you,
he remembers that you stunned him... but if he were dead, if
Professor Quirrell were dead, if Bellatrix were dead, there would
be no one to contradict your story.</i></p>
<p>Slowly, Harry's hand started to rise, pointing his wand at the
police officer and -</p>
<p>Harry's hand halted.</p>
<p>He had a distant sense he was behaving uncharacteristically of
himself, somehow. Like there was something he'd forgotten,
something important, but he was having trouble remembering what it
was, exactly.</p>
<p>Oh. That was right. He was someone who believed in the value of
human life.</p>
<p>A sense of puzzlement accompanied the thought, he couldn't quite
remember <i>why</i> other people's lives had seemed valuable...</p>
<p><i>All right,</i> said the logical part of him, w<i>hy has my
mind changed between then and now?</i></p>
<p>Because he was in Azkaban...</p>
<p>And he'd forgotten to recast the Patronus Charm...</p>
<p>Doing anything at all, somehow, seemed like a tremendous effort,
like the thought of action itself was a weight too heavy to lift;
but it did seem like a good idea to recast the Patronus Charm, for
he was still able to be afraid of Dementors. And though he couldn't
remember what it was like to be happy, he knew that this wasn't
it.</p>
<p>Harry's hand rose to hold his wand level before him, his fingers
took the starting positions.</p>
<p>And then Harry paused.</p>
<p>He couldn't... quite remember... what he'd used as his happy
thought.</p>
<p>That was odd, it had been something very important, he really
ought to be able to remember it... something to do with death? But
that wasn't happy...</p>
<p>His body was shivering, Azkaban hadn't seemed so cold before,
and it seemed to be getting colder even as he thought. It was too
late for him, he'd already sunk too far, he'd never be able to cast
the Patronus Charm now -</p>
<p><i>That may be the Dementation talking rather than an accurate
estimate,</i> observed the logical part of himself, habits that had
been encoded into sheer reflex, requiring no energy to activate.
<i>Think of the Dementors' fear as a cognitive bias, and try to
overcome it the way you would overcome any other cognitive bias.
Your hopeless feelings may not indicate that the situation is
actually hopeless. It may only indicate that you are in the
presence of Dementors. All negative emotions and pessimistic
estimates must now be considered suspect, fallacious until proven
valid.</i></p>
<p>(If you'd been watching the boy as he thought, you would have
seen a distant, abstract, puzzled frown move across his face, below
the glasses and the lightning-bolt scar. His hand stayed in the
starting position for the Patronus Charm, and did not move.)</p>
<p><i>The presence of Dementors interferes with the part of you
that processes happiness. If you cannot retrieve your happy thought
by mnemonic association on the key of happiness, perhaps you can
get at the memory some other way instead. When was the last time
you talked to someone about the Patronus Charm?</i></p>
<p>Harry couldn't seem to remember that either.</p>
<p>A crushing wave of despair swept over him, and was dismissed by
the logical part of himself as untrustworthy, external, not-Harry,
the dull weight still pressed him down but his mind went on
thinking, it didn't take much effort to think...</p>
<p><i>When was the last time you talked to someone about
Dementors?</i></p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had said that he was already able to feel the
presence of Dementors, and Harry had said to Professor Quirrell...
he'd told Professor Quirrell...</p>
<p>...to hold to the memory of the stars, of falling bodilessly
through space, like an Occlumency barrier across his entire
mind.</p>
<p>His second Defense class of the year, on Friday, that was when
Professor Quirrell had shown him the stars, and again on
Christmas.</p>
<p>It didn't take much effort to remember them, the searing points
of white against perfect blackness.</p>
<p>Harry remembered the great cloudy wash of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Harry remembered the peace.</p>
<p>Some of the coldness at the fringes of his limbs seemed to
retreat.</p>
<p>There were words he had spoken out loud on the day he'd first
cast the Patronus Charm, his mind could remember the sounds and the
speech even as the feelings seemed distant...</p>
<p>...<i>I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the natural
order.</i></p>
<p>You cast the True Patronus Charm by thinking about the value of
human life.</p>
<p><i>...But there are other lives that are still alive to be
fought for. Your life, and my life, and Hermione Granger's life,
all the lives of Earth, and all the lives beyond, to be defended
and protected.</i></p>
<p>Then the idea of killing everyone... that hadn't been his true
self, that had been the Dementation talking...</p>
<p>Despair was the Dementors' influence.</p>
<p><i>Where there's life, there's hope. The Auror is still alive.
Professor Quirrell is still alive. Bellatrix is still alive. I'm
still alive. No one's actually died yet...</i></p>
<p>Harry could picture the Earth, now, in the midst of the
starfield, the blue-white orb.</p>
<p><i>...and I won't let them!</i></p>
<p>"Expecto Patronum!"</p>
<p>The words came out a little halting, and when the human shape
burst back into existence it was dim at first, moonlight instead of
sunlight, white instead of silver.</p>
<p>But it strengthened, slowly, as Harry breathed in deliberate
rhythm, recovering. Letting the light drive back the darkness from
his mind. Remembering the things that he had almost forgotten, and
channeling them back into the Patronus Charm.</p>
<p>Even when the light blazed full and silver once more,
illuminating the corridor more brightly than the gas lamps,
banishing fully the cold, Harry's limbs still shook. That had been
too close.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. All right. It was time to reconsider
the situation now that his thoughts were no longer being
artificially darkened by Dementors.</p>
<p>Harry reviewed the situation.</p>
<p>...still looked pretty hopeless, actually.</p>
<p>It wasn't the crushing despair of before, but Harry still felt
wobbly, to put it mildly. He didn't dare go dark and it was his
dark side that had the ability to take this level of problem in
stride. It was his dark side that would have laughed scornfully at
the very concept of giving up just because he'd lost Professor
Quirrell and was marooned in the depths of Azkaban and had been
seen by a police officer. The ordinary Harry was not able to take
that sort of thing in stride.</p>
<p>But there wasn't any option except to keep moving forward
anyway. You couldn't get any <i>more</i> pointless than giving up
before you'd actually lost.</p>
<p>Harry looked around.</p>
<p>Dim gas lights lit a corridor of grey metal, whose sides and
floor and ceiling were slashed in places, gouged and melted,
telling anyone who cared to look that there had been battle
here.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell could have repaired it easily enough, if
he'd...</p>
<p>The sense of betrayal struck Harry with full force, then.</p>
<p><i>Why... why did he... why...</i></p>
<p><i>Because he's evil,</i> said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,
quietly and sadly. <i>We told you so.</i></p>
<p><i>No!</i> thought Harry desperately. <i>No, it doesn't make
sense, we were going to commit the perfect crime, the Auror could
have been Obliviated, the corridor repaired, it wasn't too late but
it would have BEEN too late if he'd died!</i></p>
<p><i>But Professor Quirrell was never really planning to commit
the perfect crime,</i> said the grim voice of Slytherin. <i>He</i>
wanted <i>the crime to be noticed. He wanted everyone to know that
someone had killed an Auror and broken Bellatrix Black out of
Azkaban. He would have prepared some kind of evidence, some proof
he could reveal of your involvement, to use as blackmail against
you; and you would have been bound to him forever.</i></p>
<p>Harry's Patronus almost went out, then.</p>
<p><i>No...</i> Harry thought.</p>
<p><i>Yes,</i> said the other three parts of him sadly.</p>
<p><i>No. It still doesn't make sense. Professor Quirrell had to
know I would turn against him the instant I saw him kill an Auror.
That I might very well go ahead and confess to Dumbledore, hoping
to plead the true fact that I was tricked. And... in terms of
blackmail, does his killing an Auror against my will, really add
all</i> that <i>much to breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban with my
willing help? It would have been more cunning to keep the evidence
of my involvement with the basic crime, but still pretend to be my
ally for as long as he could, saving the blackmail to use only if
it became necessary...</i></p>
<p><i>Rationalization,</i> said Slytherin. <i>So why</i> did
<i>Professor Quirrell do it, then?</i></p>
<p>And Harry thought with a tinge of desperation - knowing, even as
he thought it, that he was motivated in part by a desire to reject
reality, and that wasn't how the technique was meant to be wielded
- <i>I notice that I am confused.</i></p>
<p>There was internal silence. None of the parts of himself seemed
to have anything to add to that.</p>
<p>And Harry continued to take stock of the moderately
hopeless-looking situation.</p>
<p>Did Harry need to re-evaluate the probability that Bellatrix was
evil?</p>
<p>...not in any mission-relevant sense. It was a <i>given</i> that
Bellatrix was currently evil. Whether she was an innocent who'd
been made that way by torture and Legilimency and unspeakable
rituals, or whether she'd chosen it of her own will, didn't have
much bearing on the current situation. The key fact was that while
Bellatrix thought Harry was the Dark Lord, she would obey him.</p>
<p>That was one resource, then. But Bellatrix was starved and
nine-tenths dead...</p>
<p><i>'Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange...'</i></p>
<p>Bellatrix had said that, in her shattered voice, after Harry's
Patronus had blazed out of control.</p>
<p>Harry thought, and he couldn't have quite said <i>why</i> he
thought this, it might have just been his own mind making things
up, but... it seemed likely that what the Dementors had taken from
you long ago was lost forever. But what the Dementors had taken
from you <i>recently,</i> the True Patronus Charm might give back.
Like the difference between emptying a cup, and the unused cup
fading away. Bellatrix, then, might have got back what she'd lost
in just the last week or so. Not any happy memories, those would
have been eaten years ago. But whatever strength and magic had been
drained from her in just the last week, she might have regained.
Like the equivalent of getting a week of rest, a week to build up
her magic again...</p>
<p>Harry looked at Professor Quirrell's snake form.</p>
<p>...maybe enough for an <i>Innervate.</i></p>
<p>If awakening Professor Quirrell <i>was</i>, in fact, a smart
thing to do.</p>
<p>Some of the despair came back to Harry, then. He couldn't trust
Professor Quirrell, couldn't trust that reviving him would be wise,
not after what had just happened.</p>
<p><i>Steady,</i> Harry thought to himself, and looked at the
crumpled form of the Auror.</p>
<p>Bellatrix might <i>also</i> be able to manage a Memory
Charm.</p>
<p>That could be step one, anyway. It wasn't exactly getting
everyone safely out of Azkaban, and the Aurors <i>would</i> know
afterward that something strange had happened, they might suspect
Bellatrix's body and perform an autopsy. But it was a step.</p>
<p>...and <i>would</i> it be all that hard to get out of Azkaban?
If they could get to the top of Azkaban quickly enough, before the
Auror was supposed to report back in, before anyone noticed him
missing, then they could just fly out through the hole Professor
Quirrell had made, and get far enough away from Azkaban to activate
the portkey Harry already had in his possession. (Both Professor
Quirrell and Harry had portkeys, and both were powerful enough to
transport two humans, plus or minus a snake. As with their
doubly-concealed departure from Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell had
put enough safety margin in his plans to impress even Harry.)</p>
<p>Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell's snake form, which
Harry dared not touch or levitate.</p>
<p>Harry turned and strode quickly toward where Bellatrix was
waiting on the stairs. He could feel his spirits reviving a little.
It <i>was</i> starting to look like a good plan, and there was no
time to waste in going about it.</p>
<p>What to do with Professor Quirrell, or for that matter
Bellatrix, after the portkey took them to where they were supposed
to hand Bellatrix over to the psychiatric healer... well, Harry
could work that out along the way. Harry would probably have to
bamboozle the healer into doing something - which was going to take
one hell of a bamboozling, and Harry wasn't even sure what he
<i>wanted</i> done - but he and Bellatrix had to get moving
<i>now.</i></p>
<p>The main problem Harry saw, as he quickly ran the whole process
forward in his imagination, would come when they reached the roof.
Professor Quirrell had been supposed to sneak around invisibly and
Confund the monitors that would notice visitors in the aerial
surroundings of Azkaban, causing them to see a repeating loop of
scenery for a few minutes. Professor Quirrell had said that he
couldn't Disillusion Harry's Patronus; and if they switched
<i>off</i> the Patronus, the Dementors would notice Bellatrix was
missing, and alert the Aurors...</p>
<p>Harry's train of thought stumbled.</p>
<p>There were times when 'Aw, crap' just didn't seem to cover
it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Li's hands were sure despite the adrenaline, as he unlocked the
bars on the Vanishing Cabinet that linked Azkaban to a well-guarded
room in the interior of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
(A one-way Vanishing Cabinet, of course. The wards permitted a few
fast ways <i>into</i> Azkaban, all of them highly restricted, and
<i>no</i> fast ways out.)</p>
<p>Li stepped well back, pointed his wand at the Cabinet, spoke the
incantation "<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus</i>", and not a second
later -</p>
<p>The door of the Cabinet burst open with a bang, and into the
room strode a heavy-set, square-jawed witch with greyed hair
cropped close around her head. She wore no rank signs as she wore
no jewelry or other ornamentation, it was only an ordinary Auror's
robes that she deemed fit to grace herself: Director Amelia Bones,
head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and said to be
the only witch in the DMLE who could take Mad-Eye Moody in a fair
fight (not that either of those two were the sort to fight fairly).
Li had heard rumors that Amelia could Apparate within the bounds of
the DMLE, and this was the sort of thing that gave rise to rumors
like that, he'd called in the alarm not fifty seconds ago.</p>
<p>"Get into the air, now!" Amelia barked over her shoulder at the
female Auror trio following behind her with police broomsticks,
they must have all been crushed in there, waiting for Li to
activate the Cabinet. "I want more aerial coverage on this place!
And make sure you keep up your anti-Disillusionment Charms!" Then
her head turned toward him. "Report, Auror Li! Do we know how they
got in yet?"</p>
<p>Another Auror trio holding broomsticks materialized in the
Vanishing Cabinet and strode out after them even as Li began
talking.</p>
<p>They were followed by a trio of Hit Wizards in full battle
gear.</p>
<p>Then another trio of Hit Wizards.</p>
<p>Then another broomstick team.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The emaciated form that was Bellatrix Black was resting
motionless on the stairs when Harry got there, eyes closed, and
when Harry asked in a cold, high whisper whether she was awake, he
got no response.</p>
<p>A brief twitch of panic was countered by the thought that
Professor Quirrell had knocked her out to prevent her from hearing
the Dark Lord's cringing servant suddenly turn into a hardened
criminal and then an expert battlemage. Which was good, because she
wouldn't have heard Harry's voice saying 'Expecto Patronum'.</p>
<p>Harry drew back the hood of the Cloak, pointed his wand at
Bellatrix, and whispered as gently as he could,
"<i>Innervate.</i>"</p>
<p>From the way Bellatrix's body jerked a little, Harry didn't
think he'd managed to get it quite gentle enough.</p>
<p>The sunken dark eyes opened.</p>
<p>"Bella dear," Harry said in his cold, high voice, "I am afraid
we've run into a bit of a problem. Have you recovered enough to do
small magics?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Bellatrix's pale head nodded.</p>
<p>"Very good," Harry said dryly. "I won't ask you to walk unaided,
Bella dear, but I am afraid you must walk." He pointed his wand at
her. "<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>"</p>
<p>Harry kept the flow of force down to something he could sustain
for a while, and it was still probably lifting two-thirds of her
current body weight. She was... thin.</p>
<p>Slowly, as though for the first time in years, Bellatrix Black
pushed herself to her feet.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Amelia strode into the duty room, Auror Li and his silver badger
following behind her. She'd spun her Time-Turner the moment she'd
heard the alarm, and then spent a tense hour preparing her forces
for entry. You couldn't <i>loop</i> time within Azkaban itself,
Azkaban's future couldn't interact with its past, so she hadn't
been able to arrive before the DMLE had gotten the message, but she
should have arrived in time...</p>
<p>Her eyes went straight to the corpse, uncloaked and looking very
dead, floating beyond the viewing window.</p>
<p>"Where is Bellatrix Black?" Amelia demanded, showing no fear
before the creature of fear.</p>
<p>Even her own blood froze for an instant, as the corpse parted
its lips, and gurgled, "<i>Do not know.</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry watched, now fully invisible once more, as Bellatrix
slowly leaned down, took Professor Quirrell's wand (which Harry
dared not touch), and slowly straightened again.</p>
<p>Then Bellatrix pointed the wand at the snake, and said, her
voice precise though it was still a whisper,
"<i>Innervate.</i>"</p>
<p>The snake did not stir.</p>
<p>"Shall I try again, my Lord?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. He swallowed the sick feeling. Harry had
decided to say the hell with it and try to revive Professor
Quirrell after he'd realized that the Dementors had probably
alerted the Aurors by now. His high, cold voice went on,
unperturbed, "Do you think you are able to perform a Memory Charm,
dear Bella?"</p>
<p>Bellatrix paused, and then said, hesitantly, "I think so, my
Lord."</p>
<p>"Eliminate that Auror's last half-hour of memory," Harry
commanded. He'd thought a bit about whether he wanted to provide
any justification for that, what he would say if Bellatrix asked
why they weren't just killing him, in which case Harry would
explain that they were pretending to be a different power group and
then tell her to shut up -</p>
<p>But Bellatrix simply pointed her wand at the Auror, stood
silently for a time, and finally whispered, "<i>Obliviate.</i>"</p>
<p>She swayed, then, but did not fall.</p>
<p>"Very good, my dear Bella," Harry said, and chuckled thinly.
"And I will ask you to carry that snake."</p>
<p>Again, the woman said nothing, demanded no explanations, didn't
ask why Harry or the apparently-invisible Patronus caster couldn't
do it. She only staggered to where the long snake lay, slowly bent
over, picked it up, draped it over her shoulder.</p>
<p>(A tiny little part of Harry observed that it was very
<i>relaxing</i> to have a minion that would just follow orders so
unquestioningly, and even got as far as thinking that he could
totally get used to having a minion like Bellatrix, before that
mind-fraction was screamed into silence by his mortally offended
remainder.)</p>
<p>"Follow," the boy commanded his minion, and began to walk.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was starting to get crowded in the duty room, almost too
crowded to breathe, though there was still space around Amelia
herself; if needing to breathe meant that you had to crowd Director
Bones, it was better not to breathe.</p>
<p>Amelia looked at where Ora was fiddling with Auror McCusker's
mirror. "Specialist Weinbach," she barked, causing the young witch
to start. "Any response from One-Hand's mirror?"</p>
<p>"None," Ora said nervously, "it's... I mean it has to be jammed,
not dead, carefully jammed because it didn't set off the alarms,
but the line is so blank the mirror might as well be broken..."</p>
<p>Amelia didn't let her expression change, though the part of her
that was already mourning One-Hand got a little sadder and a lot
more angry. Seven months, he'd had seven months left until his
retirement after a full century of service. She remembered him as
an eager young Auror, so very long ago, and his whole career he'd
served the DMLE with perfect loyalty, at least when it came to
anything really important...</p>
<p>Someone would <i>burn</i> for this.</p>
<p>The Dementor still hovered outside the window, casting its
useless shadow of dread over their operations; all the creature
could do was gurgle its lack of knowledge or fail to reply at all,
when asked questions like 'Did Bellatrix Black escape?' and 'Why
can't you find her?' and 'How is she being hidden?' Amelia was
starting to worry that the criminals were already gone, when -</p>
<p>"We found a hole in the roof over C spiral!" someone shouted
from the doorway. "Still open, ward circumventions still
active!"</p>
<p>Amelia's lips peeled back in a smile like a wolf opening its
jaws to eat.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black was still in Azkaban.</p>
<p>And in Azkaban, Bellatrix Black would remain forever.</p>
<p>She took a stride toward the window, ignoring the Dementor now,
and looked up at the sky above, to check with her own eyes the
patrolling broomsticks. She couldn't see the whole sky from here,
but she saw ten brooms go past on a patrol pattern and that already
ought to be enough to catch anyone, though she fully meant to put
every broom she could in the air. Her Aurors were equipped with the
fastest racing broom currently on the market, the Nimbus 2000; no
unsuccessful chases for <i>her</i> people.</p>
<p>Amelia turned back from the window, and frowned. The room was
getting ridiculously crowded, and two thirds of these people didn't
<i>need</i> to be here, they just <i>wanted</i> to be close to the
center of the action. If there was one thing Amelia couldn't
tolerate, it was people who did what they wanted instead of what
was needed.</p>
<p>"All right, you lot!" Amelia bellowed at them. "Stop hanging
around here and start securing the top level of each spiral! That's
right," she said to the looks of surprise, "all three! They could
tunnel through a floor or a ceiling to go between them, in case you
hadn't worked that out! We're going down level by level until we
catch them! I'll take C spiral, Scrimgeour, you're on B..." She
paused, then, remembering that Mad-Eye had retired last year, who
could she... "Shacklebolt, you're on the A spiral, take with the
strongest other fighters! Check every set of cells you pass, look
under blankets, do the full set of detection Charms in every
corridor! Nobody leaves Azkaban until the criminals are caught,
nobody! And..." People looked at Amelia in surprise as her voice
trailed off.</p>
<p><i>The criminals had invented some way to prevent the Dementors
from finding Bellatrix Black.</i></p>
<p>That ought to have been <i>impossible.</i></p>
<p>It chilled her blood, contemplating that. It was like...</p>
<p>Amelia took a deep breath, and spoke once more, in a voice of
steel command. "And when you catch them, make bloody sure they're
the real criminals and not our own people forced to take Polyjuice.
Anyone behaves oddly, check them for the Imperius Curse. Keep each
other in sight at all times. Don't assume an Auror uniform is
friendly if you don't recognize the face." She turned to the
communications specialist. "Tell the broomsticks. If one of the
brooms peels off for no reason, <i>half</i> of them are to hunt it
down while the <i>rest</i> keep patrolling. And change the
harmonics on everything changeable, they may have stolen our keys."
Then back to the rest of the room. "No Auror is above suspicion
unless they have no family left to threaten."</p>
<p>She saw it, the cold looks that came over the older faces, saw
some of the younger Aurors flinch, and knew that they
understood.</p>
<p>But she said it out loud, just to be sure.</p>
<p>"We're fighting the old Wizarding War today, everyone. Just
because You-Know-Who is dead doesn't mean the Death Eaters have
forgotten his tricks. Now <i>go!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry walked in silence through the gas-lit grey corridor,
invisible beside Bellatrix and the silver shape following them,
trying to think of a better plan.</p>
<p>At first, when he'd realized that the Aurors probably knew
already, and that moreover, Professor Quirrell wasn't waking
up...</p>
<p>His thoughts <i>had</i> frozen up there, for a second.</p>
<p>And then stayed frozen, even as he'd gotten himself and
Bellatrix heading downward, to buy as much time as possible; the
Aurors, Harry figured, would start at the top and move down level
by level. The Aurors could afford to move slowly and securely; they
knew their prey had no way out.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't been able to think of any way out.</p>
<p>Until Harry had said to himself, <i>well, if it was just a war
game, what would General Chaos do?</i></p>
<p>From which an answer had followed instantly.</p>
<p>And then Harry had thought, <i>but if it's</i> that <i>easy, why
hasn't anyone broken out of Azkaban before?</i></p>
<p>And after he'd realized the possible problem: <i>Fine, what
would General Chaos do about</i> that?</p>
<p>Whereupon General Chaos had come up with an amendment to his
first plan.</p>
<p>It was...</p>
<p>It was the most insanely <i>Gryffindor</i> thing Harry had
ever...</p>
<p>So now he was trying to think of a <i>better</i> plan, and not
having much luck.</p>
<p><i>Picky picky picky,</i> said Gryffindor. <i>Who was
complaining about not having</i> any <i>plan one minute earlier?
You should be glad we came up with anything at all, Mister
Now-We're-Doomed.</i></p>
<p>"My Lord," Bellatrix whispered haltingly, as she navigated the
next flight of stairs downward, "am I going back to my cell, my
Lord?"</p>
<p>Harry's brain was distracted, so it took him that long to
process the words, and then another moment to process the horror,
while Bellatrix continued speaking.</p>
<p>"I would... please, my Lord, I would very much rather die," her
voice said. And then, in a smaller voice, a whisper that was barely
there, "but I will go back if you ask it of me, my Lord..."</p>
<p>"We are not going back to your cell," hissed Harry's voice, on
automatic. Nothing of what he felt was allowed to reach his
face.</p>
<p><i>Um...</i> said Hufflepuff. <i>Did you seriously just think,
'You ought to work for me,</i> I <i>would appreciate you?'</i></p>
<p><i>A stone would respond to that kind of loyalty,</i> Harry
thought. <i>Even if I'm only getting it by mistake, I can't help
but -</i></p>
<p><i>She's the Dark Lord's loyal killer and torturer, and the
supposed reason she's loyal is because an innocent girl was broken
into pieces and used as raw material to make her,</i> said
Hufflepuff. <i>Did you forget?</i></p>
<p><i>If someone shows me that much loyalty, even by mistake,
there's a part of me that can't help but feel something. The Dark
Lord must have been...</i> evil <i>doesn't seem like a strong
enough word, he must have been</i> empty<i>... to not appreciate
her loyalty, artificial or not.</i></p>
<p>The better parts of Harry didn't have much to say to that.</p>
<p>And that was when Harry heard it.</p>
<p>It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took
forward.</p>
<p>A woman's voice, distant, indistinct.</p>
<p>His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words.</p>
<p>"...please don't..."</p>
<p>"...didn't mean..."</p>
<p>"...don't die..."</p>
<p>Then his brain knew <i>who</i> he was hearing, and in almost the
same moment, figured out <i>what</i> he was hearing.</p>
<p>Because Professor Quirrell wasn't there to keep the silence any
more, and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent.</p>
<p>Faint the woman's voice, repeating:</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the
emotion in the words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation
of...</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>...the woman's worst memory, rehearsing over and over
again...</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>...the murder that had sent her to Azkaban...</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</p>
<p>...where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever
she'd killed, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop.
Though she must have been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount
of life left in her voice.</p>
<p>The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had
passed those doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest
sign of disturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive
proof of evil, if Harry's own lips hadn't remained silent in the
presence of Bellatrix, his breathing regular, while something
inside him screamed and screamed and screamed.</p>
<p>The Patronus brightened, not out of control, but it brightened,
with every step Harry took forward.</p>
<p>It brightened further as Harry and Bellatrix descended the
stairs, she stumbled and Harry offered her his left arm thrust
outside the Cloak, braving the sense of doom from being that close
to the snake draped around her neck. There was a surprised look on
her face, but she accepted it, and said nothing.</p>
<p>It helped Harry, being able to help Bellatrix, but it wasn't
enough.</p>
<p>Not when he saw the huge metal door in the center of that
level's corridor.</p>
<p>Not when they came closer, and the woman's voice fell silent,
because there was a Patronus near her now, and she wasn't reliving
her worst memory any more.</p>
<p><i>Good,</i> said a voice inside him. <i>That was step
one.</i></p>
<p>Harry's steps carried him inevitably forward toward the metal
door.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p><i>Now unlock the door -</i></p>
<p>...Harry kept walking...</p>
<p><i>What do you think you're doing? Go back and get her out of
there!</i></p>
<p>...kept walking...</p>
<p><i>Save her! What are you doing? She's hurting YOU HAVE TO SAVE
HER!</i></p>
<p>The portkey Harry was carrying could transport two humans, only
two, plus or minus a snake. If they'd had Professor Quirrell's
portkey too... but they <i>didn't</i>, Professor Quirrell's human
form was carrying that, there was no way to get it... Harry could
only save one person today, and there was only one person on the
lowest level of Azkaban, in the most desperate need...</p>
<p>"DON'T GO!" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal
door. "No, no, no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't
-"</p>
<p>There was a light in the corridor and it grew brighter.</p>
<p>"Please," sobbed the woman's voice, "please, I can't remember my
children's names any more -"</p>
<p>"Sit down, Bella," Harry's voice said, somehow he kept his voice
in a cold whisper, "I must deal with this," the Hover Charm
diminishing and switching off even as Bella obediently sat down,
her skeletal form dark against the brightening air.</p>
<p><i>I'll die,</i> thought Harry.</p>
<p>The air went on brightening.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn't a <i>certainty</i> that Harry would
die.</p>
<p>It was just a probability of death, and weren't some things
worth a probability of dying?</p>
<p>The air went on brightening, the greater Patronus was beginning
to form around him, the brilliant human shape was becoming
indistinct within the burning air, as Harry's life went to feed the
fire.</p>
<p><i>If I wipe out the Dementors, then even if I live, they'll
know it was me, that I was the one who did this... I'll lose my
support, lose the war...</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah?</i> said the inner voice that was urging him on.
<i>After you destroy all the Dementors in Azkaban? I'd think that'd
tend to prove your credentials as a Light Lord, actually, so SAVE
HER SAVE HER YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER -</i></p>
<p>The humanoid shape could no longer be seen as a separate
entity.</p>
<p>The corridor couldn't be seen.</p>
<p>Harry's own body was invisible within the Cloak.</p>
<p>There was only a bodiless viewpoint within an infinite expanse
of silver light.</p>
<p>Harry could feel the life leaving him, fueling the spell; far
away, he could feel the shadows of Death begin to fray.</p>
<p><i>I meant to accomplish more with my life than this... I was
going to fight the Dark Lord, I was going to merge the wizarding
and Muggle worlds...</i></p>
<p>Lofty goals seemed very distant, very abstract, compared to one
woman begging him for help, it wasn't <i>certain</i> that Harry
would ever do anything more important than this one thing, this one
thing that he could do now and here.</p>
<p>And with what might have been his last breath, Harry
thought:</p>
<p><i>There are other Dementors, probably other Azkabans... if I'm
going to do this, I should do it when I'm closer to the central
pit, it will take less of my life that way, which increases the
probability that I'll survive to destroy other Dementors... even
assuming this is the optimal thing to do, if there's a right time
and place to do this, it isn't now and here, IT ISN'T NOW AND
HERE!</i></p>
<p><i>What?</i> said the other part of him indignantly, as it
searched for a counterargument that didn't exist -</p>
<p>Slowly the light died back down, as Harry concentrated on that
one indisputable fact, the one obvious truth that they weren't in
the optimal place, the time <i>couldn't</i> be <i>now...</i></p>
<p>Slowly the light died back down.</p>
<p>Part of Harry's life flowed back into him.</p>
<p>Part had been lost as radiation.</p>
<p>But Harry had enough left to stay on his feet, and keep the
silver human shape bright; and when his wand arm raised and his
voice whispered "Wingardium Leviosa", the magic flowed obediently
out of him and helped Bellatrix to her feet. (For it wasn't his
magic he had expended, it had never been his magic that fueled the
Patronus Charm.)</p>
<p><i>I swear,</i> Harry thought, breathing as regularly as he
could in Bellatrix's presence, while tears streamed down his
invisible cheeks, <i>I swear upon my life and my magic and my art
as a rationalist, I swear by everything I hold sacred and all my
happy memories, I give my oath that someday I will end this place,
please, please may I be forgiven...</i></p>
<p>And the two of them walked on, as a murderess's voice screamed
and begged someone to come back and save her.</p>
<p>There should have been more time, there should have been a
ceremony, for Harry's sacrifice of that piece of himself, but
Bellatrix was beside him and so Harry just had to keep on walking
without a pause, saying nothing, breathing evenly.</p>
<p>So Harry walked on, leaving a piece of himself behind. It would
dwell in this place and time forever, he knew. Even after Harry
came back someday with a company of other True Patronus casters and
they destroyed all the Dementors here. Even if he melted the
triangular building and burned the island low enough that the sea
would wash over it, leaving no trace that such a place as this had
ever once existed. Even then he wouldn't get it back.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The flock of luminous creatures stopped staring downward, and
began patrolling the metal corridor as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>"Just like last time?" Director Bones snapped in the direction
of Auror Li, and the young Auror replied, "Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>The Director fired off another query to see if the Dementors
could now find their target, and looked unsurprised to hear a
negative reply a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Emmeline Vance was feeling torn between her loyalties.</p>
<p>Emmeline wasn't a member of the Order of the Phoenix any more,
they had disbanded after the end of the last war. And during the
war, she'd known, they'd all known, that Director Crouch had
quietly approved of their off-the-books battle.</p>
<p>Director Bones wasn't Crouch.</p>
<p>But they were hunting Bellatrix Black now, who had been a Death
Eater, and who was certainly being rescued by Death Eaters. Their
Patronuses were behaving oddly - all the bright creatures stopping
and staring off downward, before they'd gone back to following
their masters. And the Dementors couldn't find their target.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that this would be an extremely good time to
consult Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Should she just <i>suggest</i> to Director Bones that they
contact Dumbledore? But if Director Bones hadn't contacted him
already...</p>
<p>Emmeline wavered for a while, probably too long, and then
finally decided. <i>The hell with it,</i> she thought. <i>We're all
on the same side, we need to stick together whether Director Bones
likes it or not.</i></p>
<p>At a thought, her silver sparrow fluttered onto her
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Drop behind us to guard our rear," Emmeline murmured softly,
almost without moving her lips, "wait until no one is looking
directly at you, then go to Albus Dumbledore. If he is not already
by himself, wait until he is. And tell him this: Bellatrix Black is
breaking out of Azkaban, and the Dementors cannot find her."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="56">Chapter 56</h2><h3>TSPE, Constrained Optimization,
Pt 6</h3>
<p>Silent, it was thankfully silent, the metal door on the next
level down. Either there wasn't someone behind there, or they were
hurting quietly, maybe they were screaming but their voice had
given out already, or they were just muttering quietly to
themselves in the dark...</p>
<p><i>I'm not sure I can do this,</i> Harry thought, and he
couldn't blame the despairing thought on the Dementors either. It
would be better to be lower, safer to be lower, his plan would take
time to implement and the Aurors were probably already working
their way down. But if Harry had to pass any more of those metal
doors while staying silent and keeping his breathing perfectly
regular, he might go mad; if he had to leave a piece of himself
behind at each one, soon there wouldn't be anything left of him
-</p>
<p>A luminous moonlit cat leaped into existence and landed in front
of Harry's Patronus. Harry almost screamed, which wouldn't have
helped his image with Bellatrix.</p>
<p>"Harry!" said the voice of Professor McGonagall, sounding as
alarmed as Harry had ever heard from her. "Where are you? Are you
all right? This is my Patronus, answer me!"</p>
<p>With a convulsive effort, Harry cleared his mind, repurposed his
throat, forced calm, swapped in a different personality like an
Occlumency barrier. It took a few seconds and he hoped like hell
that Professor McGonagall didn't notice a problem with that thanks
to the communications delay, just as he hoped like hell that
Patronuses didn't report on their surroundings.</p>
<p>A young boy's innocent voice said, "I'm in Mary's Place,
Professor, in Diagon Alley. Going to the restroom actually. What's
wrong?"</p>
<p>The cat leaped away, and Bellatrix began to chuckle softly,
dusty appreciative laughter, but she cut herself off abruptly at a
hiss from Harry.</p>
<p>A moment later the cat returned, and said in Professor
McGonagall's voice, "I'm coming to pick you up right now. Don't go
<i>anywhere</i>, if you're not around the Defense Professor don't
go back to him, don't say anything to anyone, I'll be there as
quickly as I can!"</p>
<p>And the bright cat blurred forward and vanished.</p>
<p>Harry glanced down at his watch, noting down the time, so that
after he got everyone out of here, and Professor Quirrell anchored
the Time-Turner again, he could go back and be in the restroom of
Mary's Place at the appropriate time...</p>
<p><i>You know,</i> said the problem-solving part of his brain,
<i>there's a limit to how many constraints you can add to a problem
before it</i> really is <i>impossible, you know that?</i></p>
<p>It shouldn't have mattered, and it didn't really, it didn't
compare to the suffering of a single prisoner in Azkaban, and yet
Harry still found himself feeling very aware that if his plan
didn't end with him being picked up from Mary's Place just like
he'd never left, and the Defense Professor looking completely
innocent of any and all wrongdoing, Professor McGonagall was going
to <i>kill him.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C
spiral, shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous
shield to their rear, Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and
wondering if she ought to consult the obvious expert. If only he
wasn't so -</p>
<p>Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would
see as she turned.</p>
<p>A third of her Aurors were spinning around and leveling their
wands on the old wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver
beard who had appeared directly within their midst, a bright
red-golden phoenix on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Hold your fire!" Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but
faking the phoenix travel would have been rather more difficult -
the wards permitted it as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though
there were no fast ways out.</p>
<p>The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long
moment.</p>
<p>(Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors
had sent the word, there were several former members of the Order
of the Phoenix with her; she tried to remember, in the back of her
mind, if she'd seen Emmeline's sparrow or Andy's cat missing from
the flock of bright creatures; but she knew that it was futile. It
might not even be any of her people, for the old meddler often knew
things he had no way at all of knowing.)</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous
gesture. "I hope I am not unwelcome here," the wizard said calmly.
"We are all on the same side, are we not?"</p>
<p>"That depends," Amelia said in a hard voice. "Are you here to
help us catch criminals, or to protect them from the consequences
of their actions?" <i>Are you going to try to stop the killer of my
brother from getting her well-deserved Kiss, old meddler?</i> From
what Amelia heard, Dumbledore had gotten smarter toward the end of
the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye's nonstop nagging; but had relapsed
into his foolish mercies the instant Voldemort's body was
found.</p>
<p>A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the
shining animals, gleamed off the old wizard's half-moon glasses as
he spoke. "Even less than you would I see Bellatrix Black freed,"
the old wizard said. "She <i>must</i> not leave this prison alive,
Amelia."</p>
<p>Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised
gratification, the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and
a blazing silver phoenix sprang into existence, brighter perhaps
than all their other Patronuses put together. It was the first time
she'd seen that spell cast wordlessly. "Order all your Aurors to
cancel their Patronus Charms for ten seconds," said the old wizard.
"What darkness cannot find, the light may."</p>
<p>Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, who
would notify all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding
Dumbledore's will to be done.</p>
<p>That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful
silence, none of the Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to
weigh her own thoughts. <i>She must not leave this prison
alive...</i> Albus Dumbledore wouldn't turn into Bartemius Crouch
without a strong reason. If he'd meant to tell her <i>why</i>, he
already would have; but it certainly wasn't a positive sign.</p>
<p>Still, it was good to know they'd be able to work together on
this one.</p>
<p>"Now," said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms
winked out except that blazing silver phoenix.</p>
<p>"Is there another Patronus still present?" the old wizard said
clearly to the bright creature.</p>
<p>The bright creature dipped its head in a nod.</p>
<p>"Can you find it?"</p>
<p>The silver head nodded again.</p>
<p>"Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?"</p>
<p>A final nod from the blazing phoenix.</p>
<p>"It is done," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>"Over," said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised
her wand and began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some
extra concentration, with that wolfish smile already on her face,
to think of the first time Susan had kissed her cheek, instead of
dwelling on the looming fate of Bellatrix Black. That other Kiss
was a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind for the
Patronus Charm.)</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>They hadn't even gotten to the end of that corridor before
Harry's Patronus raised its hand, politely, as though in a
classroom.</p>
<p>Harry thought quickly. The question was how to - no, that was
also obvious.</p>
<p>"It seems," Harry said in a coldly amused voice, "that someone
has instructed this Patronus to speak its message only to me." He
chuckled. "Well then. Pardon me, dear Bella. <i>Quietus.</i>"</p>
<p>At once the silver humanoid said in Harry's own voice, "There is
another Patronus which seeks this Patronus."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Harry. And then, without pausing to think
about what was happening, "Can you block it? Stop it from finding
you?"</p>
<p>The silver humanoid shook its head.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their
Patronus Charms, when -</p>
<p>The blazing silver phoenix flew off, and the true red-golden
phoenix followed it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of
them with his long wand gripped low.</p>
<p>The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard
like water, and closed behind him with hardly a ripple.</p>
<p>"<i>Albus!</i>" shouted Amelia. "What do you think you're
doing?"</p>
<p>But she already knew.</p>
<p>"Do not follow me," the old wizard's voice said sternly. "I can
protect myself, I cannot protect others."</p>
<p>The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors
flinch.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>This isn't fair, isn't fair, isn't fair! There's a limit to
how many constraints you can add to a problem before it really is
impossible!</i></p>
<p>Harry blocked off the useless thoughts, ignored the fatigue he
was feeling, and forced his mind to confront the new requirements,
he had to think <i>fast,</i> use the adrenaline on following the
chains of logic quickly and without hesitation, instead of wasting
it on despair.</p>
<p>For the mission to succeed,</p>
<p>(1) Harry would have to dispel his Patronus.</p>
<p>(2) Bellatrix needed to be hidden from the Dementors after the
Patronus was dispelled.</p>
<p>(3) Harry needed to resist the Dementors' drain after his
Patronus was dispelled.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><i>If I solve this one,</i> said Harry's brain, <i>I want a
cookie afterward, and if you make the problem any more difficult
than this, I mean the slightest bit more difficult, I am climbing
out of your skull and heading for Tahiti.</i></p>
<p>Harry and his brain considered the problem.</p>
<p>Azkaban had stood invincible for centuries, relying upon the
impossibility of evading the Dementors' gaze. So if Harry found
<i>another</i> way to hide Bellatrix from the Dementors, it would
rely on either his scientific knowledge or his realization that the
Dementors were Death.</p>
<p>Harry's brain suggested that an obvious way to stop the
Dementors from seeing Bellatrix was to make her stop existing,
i.e., kill her.</p>
<p>Harry congratulated his brain on thinking outside the box and
told it to continue searching.</p>
<p><i>Kill her and then bring her back,</i> came the next
suggestion. <i>Use Frigideiro to cool Bellatrix down to the point
where her brain activity stops, then warm her up afterward using
Thermos, just like people who fall into very cold water can be
successfully revived half-an-hour later without noticeable brain
damage.</i></p>
<p>Harry considered this. Bellatrix might not survive in her
debilitated state. <i>And</i> it might not stop Death from seeing
her. <i>And</i> he'd have trouble carrying a cold unconscious
Bellatrix very far. <i>And</i> Harry couldn't remember the research
on which exact body temperature was supposed to be nonfatal but
temporarily-brain-halting.</p>
<p>It was another good outside-the-box idea, but Harry told his
brain to keep thinking of...</p>
<p><i>...ways to hide from Death...</i></p>
<p>A frown moved over Harry's face. He'd heard something about
that, somewhere.</p>
<p><i>One of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an
excellent memory,</i> Professor Quirrell had said. <i>The key to a
puzzle is often something you read twenty years ago in an old
scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a man you met
only once...</i></p>
<p>Harry focused as hard as he could, but he couldn't remember, it
was on the tip of his tongue but he couldn't remember; so he told
his subconscious to go on trying to recollect it, and refocused his
attention on the other half of the problem.</p>
<p><i>How can I protect myself from the Dementors without a
Patronus Charm?</i></p>
<p>The Headmaster had been repeatedly exposed to a Dementor from a
few steps away, over and over throughout a whole day, and had come
out of it looking merely tired. How had the Headmaster done that?
Could Harry do it too?</p>
<p>It could just be some random genetic thing, in which case Harry
was screwed. But assuming the problem <i>was</i> solvable...</p>
<p>Then the obvious answer was that Dumbledore wasn't afraid of
death.</p>
<p>Dumbledore <i>really</i> wasn't afraid of death. Dumbledore
honestly, truly believed that death was the next great adventure.
Believed it in his core, not just as convenient words used to
suppress cognitive dissonance, not just pretending to be wise.
Dumbledore had decided that death was the natural and normative
order, and whatever tiny lingering fear was still in him, it had
taken a long time and repeated exposures for the Dementor to drain
him through that small flaw.</p>
<p>That avenue was closed to Harry.</p>
<p>And then Harry thought of the flip side, the obvious inverse
question:</p>
<p><i>Why am I so much more vulnerable than average? Other students
didn't fall over when they faced the Dementor.</i></p>
<p>Harry meant to destroy Death, to end it if he could. He meant to
live forever, if he could; he had hope of it, the thought of Death
brought him no sense of despair or inevitability. He was not
blindly attached to his own life; indeed it had taken an effort
<i>not</i> to burn away all his life on the need to protect others
from Death. Why did the shadows of Death have such power over
Harry? He would not have thought himself so afraid.</p>
<p>Was it Harry, all along, who'd been rationalizing? Who was
secretly so afraid of death that it was twisting his own thoughts,
as Harry had accused Dumbledore?</p>
<p>Harry considered this, preventing himself from flinching away.
It felt uncomfortable, but...</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>But uncomfortable thoughts weren't always <i>true</i>, and this
one didn't sound exactly right. Like there was a grain of truth,
but it wasn't hiding <i>where</i> the hypothesis said it was -</p>
<p>And that was when Harry realized.</p>
<p><i>Oh.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, I understand now.</i></p>
<p><i>The one who is afraid, is...</i></p>
<p>Harry asked his dark side what it thought of death.</p>
<p>And Harry's Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went out upon the
instant, for that desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, an
unutterable fear that would do anything not to die, throw
everything aside not to die, that couldn't think straight or feel
straight in the presence of that absolute horror, that couldn't
look into the abyss of nonexistence any more than it could have
stared straight into the Sun, a blind terrified thing that only
wanted to find a dark corner and hide and not have to think about
it any more -</p>
<p>The silver figure had darkened to moonlight, was flickering like
a failing candle -</p>
<p><i>It's all right,</i> thought Harry, <i>it's all right.</i></p>
<p>Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened
child in his arms.</p>
<p><i>It's right and proper to be horrified, because death is
horrible. You don't have to hide your horror, you don't have to
feel ashamed of it, you can wear it as a badge of honor, openly in
the Sun.</i></p>
<p>It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the
track of his thoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his
thoughts that followed his dark side's incomprehension at the
alienness of the ordinary Harry's thoughts; of all the things that
his dark side associated with its own fear of death, the one thing
it had never expected or imagined that it might find, was
acceptance and praise and help...</p>
<p><i>You don't have to fight alone,</i> Harry said silently to his
dark side. <i>The rest of me will back you up on this. I won't let
myself die, and I won't let my friends die either. Not you/I, not
Hermione, not Mum or Dad, not Neville or Draco or anyone, this is
the will to protect...</i> Visualizing wings of sunlight, like the
wings of the Patronus he had spread, to give shelter to that
frightened child.</p>
<p>The Patronus brightened again, the world spun around Harry or it
was his own mind that was spinning?</p>
<p><i>Take my hand,</i> Harry thought and visualized, <i>come with
me, and we will do this thing together...<br /></i></p>
<p>There was a lurch in Harry's mind, like his brain had taken one
step to the left, or the universe had taken one step to the
right.</p>
<p>And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights
far outshone by the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped
Patronus, an invisible boy stood with a strange small smile on his
face, shaking only slightly.</p>
<p>Harry knew, somehow, that he'd just done something significant,
something that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to
Dementors.</p>
<p>And more than that, he'd <i>remembered</i>. Thinking of Death as
an anthropomorphic figure had done the trick, ironically enough.
Now Harry could remember it, what was reputed to hide someone from
the gaze of Death himself...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard's striding legs came to an
abrupt halt; for the bright silver thing that was his guide, had
halted in midair, fluttering its wings in distress. The brilliant
white phoenix craned its head, looking backward and forward as
though confused; and then it turned to its master and shook its
head in apology.</p>
<p>Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the
way he came.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry stood straight and upright, feeling the fear wash over him
and around him. Some tiny part of him might have been eroded a
little by the waves of emptiness that broke continually upon his
unmoving stone, but his limbs were not cold, and his magic was with
him. In time those waves might corrode him and consume him,
sneaking through whatever tiny part of him still cowered before
Death instead of using its fear to energize itself for battle. But
that doom would take time, with the shadows of Death far away and
uncaring of him. The flaw, the crack, the fault-line that was in
him had been repaired, and the stars blazed brightly in his mind,
vast and unafraid, and brilliant in the midst of cold and
darkness.</p>
<p>To anyone else's eyes, it would have seemed that the boy stood
alone in the dimly lit metal corridor, wearing that strange
smile.</p>
<p>For Bellatrix Black and the snake draped around her shoulders
were concealed by the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three
Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide its wearer from the gaze of
Death himself. The riddle whose answer had been lost, and which
Harry had found anew.</p>
<p>And Harry knew, now, that the concealment of the Cloak was more
than the mere transparency of Disillusionment, that the Cloak kept
you <i>hidden</i> and not just invisible, as unseeable as were
Thestrals to the unknowing. And Harry also knew that it was
Thestral blood which painted the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on
the inside of the Cloak, binding into the Cloak that portion of
Death's power, enabling the Cloak to confront the Dementors on
their own level and block them. It had felt like guessing, and yet
a certain guess, the knowledge coming to him in the instant of
solving the riddle.</p>
<p>Bellatrix was still transparent within the Cloak, but to Harry
she was no longer hidden, he knew that she was there, as obvious to
him as a Thestral. For Harry had only loaned his Cloak, not given
it; and he had comprehended and mastered the Deathly Hallow that
had been passed down through the Potter line.</p>
<p>Harry gazed directly at the invisible woman, and said, "Can the
Dementors reach you, Bella?"</p>
<p>"No," said the woman in a soft, wondering voice. Then, "But my
Lord... <i>you</i>..."</p>
<p>"If you say anything foolish, it will annoy me," Harry said
coldly. "Or are you under the impression that I would sacrifice
myself for you?"</p>
<p>"No, my Lord," the Dark Lord's servant replied, sounding
puzzled, and perhaps awed.</p>
<p>"Follow," spoke Harry's cold whisper.</p>
<p>And they continued their journey downward, as the Dark Lord
reached into his pouch, and took a cookie, and ate it. If Bellatrix
had asked, Harry would have claimed it was for the chocolate, but
she didn't ask.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the
silver and the red-golden phoenixes now following behind.</p>
<p>"<i>You -</i>" Amelia began to bellow.</p>
<p>"They have dismissed their Patronus," said Dumbledore. The old
wizard didn't seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow
overrode her own. "I cannot find them now."</p>
<p>Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks
on hold, and turned to the communications officer. "Tell the duty
room to ask the Dementors <i>again</i> if they can sense Bellatrix
Black."</p>
<p>The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment,
and a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. "No -"</p>
<p>Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.</p>
<p>"- but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn't a
prisoner."</p>
<p>"Fine!" snapped Amelia. "Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its
kind are authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and
anyone in their company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they're
to Kiss her immediately!"</p>
<p>Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him to
argue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held
his peace.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted
outside the window, conveying the Director's orders.</p>
<p>The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his
limbs, and then floated downward.</p>
<p>Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted
in the central pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls
of the vast metal structure that towered above them.</p>
<p>Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest
of all creatures began their march of horror.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="57">Chapter 57</h2><h3>TSPE, Constrained Cognition, Pt
7</h3>
<p>Harry had <i>hoped</i> that he'd just achieved fusion with his
mysterious dark side and would be enabled to draw on all of its
benefits with none of its drawbacks, call up the crystal clarity
and indomitable will on demand, without needing to go cold or
angry.</p>
<p>Once again, he'd overestimated how much progress he'd made.
<i>Something</i> had happened, but Harry still had a mysterious
dark side, it was still separate from him, and his ordinary self
was still domitable. And despite the repair work he'd done on his
dark side's fear of death, he didn't dare go dark while unshielded
in Azkaban, that was tempting fate way too much.</p>
<p>Which was unfortunate, because a bit of nondomitability would
have <i>sure come in handy about now.</i></p>
<p>What made it harder was that he couldn't slump against a wall,
couldn't break into tears, couldn't even heave a sigh. His dear
Bella was watching him and that wasn't the sort of thing her Dark
Lord would do.</p>
<p>"My Lord -" Bellatrix said. Her low voice was strained. "The
Dementors - they are coming - I can feel them, my Lord -"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Bella," said a dry voice, "I already know that."</p>
<p>Harry couldn't sense the holes in the world the same way as when
he'd been wearing the Deathly Hallow, but he could feel the empty
pull increasing in intensity. At first he'd mistaken it for the
result of descending a stairwell, until he and Bellatrix had
finished descending and the pull had gone on increasing. Then
decreased, as the Dementors moved away along the spiral, then
increased as they went up another flight of stairs... There were
Dementors within Azkaban itself now, and they were coming for him.
Of course they were. Harry might be resistant now, but he was not
<i>hidden.</i></p>
<p><i>New requirement,</i> Harry told his brain. <i>Find a way of
defeating Dementors that doesn't invoke my Patronus Charm.
Alternatively, find yet another way of hiding someone from
Dementors, besides the Cloak of Invisibility -</i></p>
<p><i>I quit,</i> said his brain. <i>Find yourself another piece of
computing substrate to solve your ridiculously overconstrained
problems.</i></p>
<p><i>I mean it,</i> thought Harry.</p>
<p><i>So do I,</i> said his brain. <i>Put up your Patronus Charm
and wait for the Aurors to find you. Be sensible. It's
over.</i></p>
<p><i>Give up...</i></p>
<p>The sucking emptiness seemed to pull harder, as he thought it;
and Harry realized what was happening, concentrated more intensely
on the stars, turned his mind away from the despair -</p>
<p><i>You know,</i> observed the logical side of him, <i>if you're
not allowed to think</i> any <i>negative thoughts because that will
open your mind to the Dementors,</i> that's <i>a cognitive bias
too, how would you know if it actually</i> was <i>time to give
up?</i></p>
<p>A desperate sobbing scream rose up from below, words mixed in
like "no" and "away". The prisoners knew, the prisoners could feel
it.</p>
<p>The Dementors were coming.</p>
<p>"My Lord, you - you should not risk yourself for me - take back
your Cloak -"</p>
<p>"Be silent, fool," hissed an angry voice. "When I decide to
sacrifice you I will tell you so."</p>
<p><i>She's got a valid point,</i> said Slytherin. <i>You</i>
shouldn't <i>risk yourself for her, there's no way her life is as
valuable as yours.</i></p>
<p>For an instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix to save
himself -</p>
<p>And in that moment, some of the dim orange gas-light seemed to
flee the corridor, a touch of cold crept over Harry's fingertips.
And he knew, then, that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the
shadows of Death, would make him vulnerable once more. Even in the
moment of making the decision, he might become unable to cast the
Patronus Charm, for he would have given up the thought that had
saved him before.</p>
<p>It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from
Bellatrix afterward, even if he couldn't cast the Patronus Charm;
and then he had to wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus
firmly on his decision <i>not</i> to do it, or he might have just
fallen over where he stood. For the whirlpool of emptiness swirling
around him was now deadly strong; there were screams coming from
<i>above</i>, and the screams below had stopped.</p>
<p><i>This is ridiculous,</i> said his logical side. <i>Rational
agents shouldn't have to put up with this sort of censored
reasoning process, all the theorems assume that how you think
doesn't affect reality apart from your actual actions, which is why
you're free to choose an optimal algorithm without worrying about
how your thoughts interact with Dementors -</i></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><i>That is a really dumb idea,</i> said Gryffindor. <i>Even I
think it's a dumb idea and I'm your Gryffindor side. You're not
seriously going to just stand there and -</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"We have a fix!" shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as
though in triumph. "The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to
level seven, C spiral, that's where they are!"</p>
<p>Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly.</p>
<p>"No," Amelia said in a level voice. "That's where <i>one</i> of
them is. The Dementors still can't find Bellatrix Black. We are not
running down there and letting her through in the confusion, and we
are not dividing our forces to be ambushed. So long as we move with
caution, we can't lose. Tell Scrimgeour and Shacklebolt to keep
going down level by level, same as before -"</p>
<p>The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn't even
bother cursing him, this time, as once again their carefully
constructed shields parted like water and rippled gently in his
wake.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry waited at the beginning of the corridor, just next to the
stairs leading upward. Bellatrix and the snake were behind him,
concealed by the Deathly Hallow that Harry had mastered; he knew,
though he could not see, that the emaciated sorceress was sitting
upon the stairs, slumped back, since Harry had withdrawn his Hover
Charm to free up his mind and magic.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes were fixed on the far end of the corridor, next to
the stairs that led downward. Not in his mind now, but in true
reality, the light in the corridor had dimmed, the temperature had
fallen. The fear thundered over him and around him like a sea
whipped by hurricane winds, and the sucking emptiness had become a
howling draw toward some approaching black hole.</p>
<p>Up the stairs at the far end, floating smoothly through the
dying air, came the voids, the absences, the wounds in the
world.</p>
<p>And Harry expected them to stop.</p>
<p>With all the will and focus he could muster, Harry <i>expected
them to stop.</i></p>
<p>Anticipated their stopping.</p>
<p>Believed they would stop.</p>
<p>...that was the idea, anyway...</p>
<p>Harry shut down the dangerous stray thought, and <i>expected the
Dementors to halt.</i> They had no intelligence of their own, they
were just wounds in the world, their form and structure was
borrowed from others' expectations. People had been able to
negotiate with them, offer them victims in exchange for
cooperation, only because they <i>believed Dementors would
bargain.</i> So if Harry believed hard enough that the voids would
turn and go, they would turn and go.</p>
<p>But the wounds in the world kept coming, the swirling fear
seemed like a solid thing now, the emptiness tearing at matter as
well as mind, substance as well as spirit, you could see the metal
beginning to tarnish as the holes in the world passed.</p>
<p>A small sound came from behind him, from Bellatrix, but she said
no word, for she had been instructed to remain silent.</p>
<p><i>Don't think of them as creatures, think of them as
psychosensitive objects, they can be controlled if I can control
myself -</i></p>
<p>The problem was that he <i>couldn't</i> control himself so
easily, couldn't make himself believe blue was green by an act of
will. Couldn't suppress all those thoughts about how irrational it
was to <i>make</i> yourself believe something. How
<i>impossible</i> it was to trick yourself into believing something
if you <i>knew</i> that was what you were doing. All the training
Harry had given himself against self-deception was refusing to
switch off <i>no matter how harmful it was in this unique special
case -</i></p>
<p>The shadows of Death crossed the halfway point of the corridor,
and Harry held up his hand, fingers spread, and said in a voice of
firm and confident command, "Stop."</p>
<p>The shadows of Death stopped.</p>
<p>Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave a strangled gasp, like it was being
torn out of her.</p>
<p>Harry gestured to her, the signal he had set up in advance which
meant, <i>repeat what you heard the Dementors say.</i></p>
<p>"They say," Bellatrix said, her voice was shaking, "they said,
'Bellatrix Black was promised us. Tell us where she hides, and you
will be spared.'"</p>
<p>"Bellatrix?" Harry said, making his voice sound amused. "She
escaped a while ago."</p>
<p>A moment later, Harry realized that he should have said that
Bellatrix was among the Aurors in the top level, that would have
caused more confusion -</p>
<p>No, it was wrong to think of the Dementors as trickable, they
were merely <i>things,</i> they were controlled only by
<i>expectations -</i></p>
<p>"They say," Bellatrix said in a cracked voice, "they say they
know you're lying."</p>
<p>The voids began to move forward again.</p>
<p><i>Her anticipations are more solidly believed than mine; she is
controlling them, unwittingly -</i></p>
<p>"Don't resist," Harry said, pointing his wand behind him.</p>
<p>"I, I love you, farewell, my Lord -"</p>
<p>"<i>Somnium.</i>"</p>
<p>It had helped, strangely enough, hearing those particular awful
words, understanding Bellatrix's mistake; it reminded Harry why he
was fighting.</p>
<p>"Stop," Harry said again. Bellatrix was asleep; now only his own
will, his own expectations rather, should control those spheres of
annihilation -</p>
<p>But they kept on gliding forward, and Harry couldn't stop
himself from worrying that the previous experience had damaged his
confidence, which meant that he <i>wouldn't</i> be able to stop
them, and as he noticed himself thinking that, he doubted even more
- he needed more time to prepare, really ought to practice
controlling just one Dementor in a cage first -</p>
<p>There was only a quarter of corridor now between Harry and the
shadows of death, the empty winds were so strong that Harry could
feel the erosion beginning in the cracks of himself.</p>
<p>And the thought came to Harry that maybe he was wrong, maybe
Dementors <i>did</i> have their own desires and planning
capability. Or maybe they were controlled by how <i>everyone</i>
thought they worked, not just whoever was closest to them. And in
either case -</p>
<p>Harry drew up his wand into the starting position for the
Patronus Charm, and spoke.</p>
<p>"One of your number went to Hogwarts and did not return. It no
longer exists; that Death is dead."</p>
<p>The Dementors halted, a dozen wounds in the world stood
motionless, while the emptiness screamed around them like a deadly
wind to nowhere.</p>
<p>"Turn and go and do not speak of this to anyone, little shadows,
or I will destroy you as well."</p>
<p>Harry's fingers slid into the starting position for the Patronus
Charm, and readied himself to cast it; in his mind, the Earth shone
among the stars, the day side bright and blue with reflected
sunlight, the night side glimmering with the light of human cities.
Harry wasn't bluffing, wasn't trying to do anything tricky with his
thoughts. The shadows of Death would move forward and be
annihilated, or they would depart, he was equally ready for
either...</p>
<p>And the voids retreated back as smoothly as they came, the winds
of nothingness lessening with each meter they traversed, as they
slid back down the stairs, and departed.</p>
<p>Whether they truly had their own pseudo-intelligence, or whether
Harry had finally succeeded in <i>expecting</i> them to go... that,
Harry didn't know.</p>
<p>But they were gone.</p>
<p>Harry took a moment to sit down beside the unconscious Bellatrix
on the stairs, and slumped down as she was slumped, closing his
eyes for a moment, only a moment, he sure as hell wasn't planning
to sleep in Azkaban, but he needed to take that moment. The Aurors
would still be going down the stairs slowly, Harry hoped, so it
wouldn't hurt to take just five minutes to rest. Harry was careful
to keep his thoughts positive, cheerful, <i>my, I'll just have some
nice regenerative rest here, and then I'll feel better,</i> rather
than, say, <i>my, I'll just collapse in emotional and physical
exhaustion,</i> because the Dementors hadn't yet retreated very
far.</p>
<p><i>And by the way,</i> Harry said to his brain, <i>you're
fired.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"I found him!" cried the old wizard's voice.</p>
<p><i>Who?</i> thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore's
return, carrying in his arms -</p>
<p>- the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected
to behold -</p>
<p>- a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he'd fought a
small war, blood dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was
chewing on a bar of chocolate, held in his one living hand.</p>
<p>Bahry One-Hand was <i>alive.</i></p>
<p>A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of
them already starting to rush forward.</p>
<p>"<i>Stay on guard!</i>" bellowed Amelia. "Check them both for
Polyjuice - scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry sensed, though he could not quite see,
that the invisible woman was pushing herself to her feet, and
turning her head to look around. "I'm... alive...?"</p>
<p>Harry was sorely tempted to say no, just to see what she made of
that. Instead he hissed, "Don't ask stupid questions."</p>
<p>"What happened?" whispered Bellatrix.</p>
<p>And the Dark Lord gave a wild, high-pitched laugh, and said, "I
scared the Dementors away, my dear Bella."</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry wished he could see Bellatrix's face;
had he said the wrong thing?</p>
<p>After a time, in a quavering voice, "Could it be, my Lord, that
in your new form, you have begun to care for me -"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said coldly, and turned from her (though he kept his
wand on her), and began walking. "And take care that you do not
offend me again, or I will abandon you here, use or no use. Now
follow, or be left behind; I have work to do."</p>
<p>Harry strode forward, not listening to the gasping sounds that
came from behind him; he knew Bellatrix was following.</p>
<p>...because the last thing that woman needed, the very last thing
she needed to start thinking before the psychiatric healer began
trying to deprogram her, was to believe that her Dark Lord could
ever love her back.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively,
looking at where Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by
two strong Aurors.</p>
<p>"Do you understand this, Amelia?"</p>
<p>"No," she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn't yet
been able to fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept
outside the main party and guarded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the old wizard said at length, "whichever of their
number can cast the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage.
Someone who was tricked into this, mayhap? For whatever reason,
they left your Auror alive; let us not be the first to wield deadly
curses, when we find them -"</p>
<p>"I see," said the old witch in sudden realization, "<i>that</i>
was their plan. It costs them nothing to Oblivate him and leave him
alive, and makes <i>us</i> hesitate -" Amelia nodded decisively,
and said to her people, "We carry on as before."</p>
<p>The old wizard sighed. "Any news from the Dementors?"</p>
<p>"If I tell you," Amelia snapped, "will you run off again?"</p>
<p>"It costs you nothing, Amelia," the old wizard said quietly,
"and may save one of your own people the fight."</p>
<p><i>Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance -</i></p>
<p>But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old
wizard was often right in the end, it was part of what made him so
annoying.</p>
<p>"The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other
person they said they saw," Amelia told him, "and they will not say
why, nor where."</p>
<p>Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phoenix on his shoulder,
whose light illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent
headshake in reply. "I cannot detect them either," said Dumbledore.
Then he shrugged. "I suppose I shall just walk the whole spiral
from top to bottom and see if anything turns up, shall I?"</p>
<p>Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that
would have made the tiniest difference.</p>
<p>"Albus," said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, "even
you can be ambushed."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my dear," the old wizard said cheerfully as he strode
off yet again, waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand
of unidentifiable dark-grey wood, "I'm invincible."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>("He didn't just really say that -" whispered the newest Auror
present, a still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to
the senior member of her trio, Auror Brooks. "Did he?")</p>
<p>("He can get away with it," Isabel whispered back to her, "he's
<i>Dumbledore,</i> not even Fate takes him seriously anymore.")</p>
<p>"And that," Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger
Aurors, "is why we never call him in on anything unless we
absolutely must."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry lay very still on the hard bench that served as the bed of
this cell, a blanket pulled over him, staying as absolutely
motionless as he could while he waited for the fear to return.
There was a Patronus approaching, and a powerful one. Bellatrix was
hidden by a Deathly Hallow, no easy Charm would penetrate that; but
Harry did not know what other arts the Aurors might employ to
detect his own self, and dared not reveal his ignorance by asking
her. So Harry lay on a hard bed, in a cell with a locked door, and
the mighty metal door locked behind him, in absolute darkness, with
a thin blanket pulled over him, hoping that whoever it was wouldn't
look in, or wouldn't look too closely if they did -</p>
<p>That wasn't a point Harry could affect, really, that part of his
fate lay entirely in the hands of the Hidden Variables. Most of his
mind was concentrating on the ongoing Transfiguration he was
performing.</p>
<p>Listening in the silence, Harry heard the quick footsteps
approach; they paused outside his door, and then -</p>
<p>- continued onward.</p>
<p>Soon the fear returned.</p>
<p>Harry didn't allow himself to notice his own relief, any more
than he allowed himself to notice the fear. He was holding in his
mind the form of a Muggle device rather larger than a car battery,
and slowly applying that Form to the substance of an ice cube
(which Harry had frozen using <i>Frigideiro</i> on water from a
bottle in his pouch). You weren't supposed to Transfigure things to
be burned, but between the original substance being water, and the
Bubble-Head Charm to protect their air supply, Harry hoped that
this wouldn't make him or anyone else sick.</p>
<p>Now it was just a question of whether there would be enough time
before the Aurors did a detailed check on this cell block, for
Harry to finish this Transfiguration, and the partial
Transfiguration he would do after that -</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began
to feel a twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had
worked a third of the way down the three spirals, in synchrony so
as not to allow any gap in their coverage that could be jumped by
cutting through a ceiling, and they'd yet to find any sign.</p>
<p>"Might I ask you to report?" Amelia said, keeping the edge out
of her voice.</p>
<p>"First a simple walk from top to bottom," said the old wizard.
He was frowning, wrinkling his face even more than usual. "I
examined Bellatrix's cell, and found a death doll left in her
place. This escape was meant to go unremarked, I think. There is
something hidden in the corner beneath a scrap of cloth; I left
that undisturbed for your Aurors to examine. On the return trip, I
opened each door and looked within the cells. I saw nothing
Disillusioned, only the prisoners -"</p>
<p>They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phoenix,
and all her Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an
urgent demand that almost started Amelia running from the corridor
on the spot.</p>
<p>"- in rather distressing condition," Dumbledore said quietly.
For a moment the blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon
glasses. "Will any of you speak to me of the consequences of their
actions?"</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> did not -" Amelia began.</p>
<p>"I know," said the old wizard. "My apologies, Amelia." He
sighed. "Some of the more recent prisoners had scraps of their
magic left, when I looked upon them, but I sensed no uneaten power;
the strongest had only as much magic left as a first-year child. I
heard Fawkes scream in distress many times, but never challenge. It
seems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well
enough to escape my mere glance."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When Harry finished his first Transfiguration, he sat up, pulled
back the blanket that had covered him, cast a quick <i>Lumos,</i>
glanced at his watch, and was shocked to see that nearly an hour
and thirty minutes had passed. How much of that time had gone by
since someone had opened the door and then closed it again - Harry
hadn't been looking in that direction, of course - that, Harry
couldn't guess.</p>
<p>"My Lord...?" whispered Bellatrix's voice, soft and very
tentative.</p>
<p>"You may speak now," Harry said. He'd told her to remain silent
while he worked.</p>
<p>"That was Dumbledore who looked upon us."</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"Interesting," Harry said neutrally. He was glad he had not
noticed this at the time. That sounded like a <i>rather close
shave</i>.</p>
<p>Harry said a word to his pouch, and began drawing forth the
magical device that he would mate to the product of his hour's
labor. Then, when that was drawn forth, another word brought forth
a tube of industrial-strength glue; before using it, Harry cast the
Bubble-Head Charm on himself and Bellatrix, and had Bellatrix cast
the same Charm on the snake, so that the glue fumes in the enclosed
cell would not harm them.</p>
<p>When the glue had begun to set, binding technology to magic,
Harry laid it down upon the bed, and sat down on the floor, resting
his magic and will for a moment before essaying the next
Transfiguration.</p>
<p>"My Lord..." Bellatrix said hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Yes?" said the dry voice.</p>
<p>"What is that device you made?"</p>
<p>Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like a good chance to check his
plans with her, under the guise of leading questions.</p>
<p>"Consider, my dear Bella," said Harry smoothly. "How difficult
is it for a powerful wizard to cut the walls of Azkaban?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Bellatrix's voice came, slow and
puzzled, "Not difficult at all, my Lord...?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," said the dry, high voice of Bella's master. "Suppose
one were to do this, and fly through the hole on a broomstick, and
soar up and away. Rescuing a prisoner from Azkaban would seem easy
then, would it not?"</p>
<p>"But my Lord..." said Bella. "The Aurors would - they have their
own broomsticks, my Lord, fast ones -"</p>
<p>Harry listened, it was as he had thought. The Dark Lord replied,
again in tones of smoothly Socratic inquiry, and Bellatrix asked a
further question, which Harry had not expected, but Harry's own
counterquestion showed that it should not matter in the end. And in
response to Bellatrix's last question, the Dark Lord only smiled,
and said that it was time for him to resume his work.</p>
<p>And then Harry got up from the floor of the cell, went to the
far end of the cells, and touched his wand to the hard surface of
the wall - the wall of Azkaban, the solid metal that separated them
from direct exposure to the Dementors' pit.</p>
<p>And Harry began a partial Transfiguration.</p>
<p>This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He'd spent hours and
hours practicing the unique magic, which had made it routine, not
much more difficult for him than ordinary Transfiguration. The
shape he was changing had not all that much total volume, the
Transfigured shape might be tall and wide and long, but it was very
thin. Half a millimeter, Harry had thought, would be enough,
considering the perfect smoothness...</p>
<p>On the long bench that served as a prison bed, where Harry had
set down the Transfigured technological device and the mated magic
item for the glue to dry, tiny letters in golden script gleamed on
the Muggle artifact. Harry hadn't really <i>planned</i> for them to
be there, but they'd kept running through the back of his mind, and
so seemed to have become part of the Transfigured form.</p>
<p>There were many different things Harry could have said before
using this particular triumph of technological ingenuity. Any
number of things that would be, in one sense or another,
appropriate. Or at least things that Harry <i>could</i> have said,
<i>would</i> have said, if Bellatrix had not been there.</p>
<p>But there was only one thing to say, that Harry would only get
the chance to say just this once, and probably never get a better
chance to say ever again. (Or <i>think,</i> anyway, if he couldn't
say it.) He hadn't seen the actual movie, but he'd seen a preview,
and for some reason the phrase had stuck in his mind.</p>
<p>The tiny golden letters upon the Muggle device said,</p>
<p><i>All right, you primitive screwheads! Listen up!</i></p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In darkness absolute, a boy stood holding his wand to the solid
metal wall of Azkaban, essaying a magic that only three other
people in the world would have believed possible, and that none
save he alone could wield.</p>
<p>Of course a powerful wizard could've cut through the wall in
seconds, with a gesture and a word.</p>
<p>For an average adult it might have been a matter of a few
minutes' work, and afterward they would have been winded.</p>
<p>But to accomplish the same end as a first-year Hogwarts student,
you had to be <i>efficient.</i></p>
<p>Luckily - well, not <i>luckily</i>, luck had nothing to do with
it - <i>conscientiously</i>, Harry had practiced Transfiguration
for an extra hour every day, to the point where he was ahead of
even Hermione in that one class; he'd practiced partial
Transfiguration to the point where his thoughts had begun taking
the true universe for granted, so that it required only slightly
more effort to keep its timeless quantum nature in mind, even as he
kept a firm mental separation between the concept of Form and the
concept of substance.</p>
<p>And the <i>problem</i> with that art having become so
routine...</p>
<p>...was that Harry could think about other things while he was
doing it.</p>
<p>Somehow his thoughts had managed to not go there, to not
confront the obvious, until he was faced with the prospect of
<i>really actually doing it in just a few minutes</i>.</p>
<p>What Harry was about to do...</p>
<p>...was dangerous.</p>
<p>Really dangerous.</p>
<p>Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.</p>
<p>Facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm had been
<i>scary,</i> but merely scary. Harry could have cast the Patronus
Charm, <i>would</i> have cast it as soon as he thought he was in
danger of not being able to do so, as soon as he felt his
resistance beginning to fail. And even if that hadn't worked...
even so, unless the Dementors had been instructed to Kiss anyone
they found, failure shouldn't have been <i>fatal.</i></p>
<p>This was different.</p>
<p>The Transfigured Muggle device could explode and kill them.</p>
<p>The interface between the technology and the magic could fail in
any number of ways and kill them.</p>
<p>The Aurors could get in a lucky shot.</p>
<p>It was just, well...</p>
<p><i>Seriously</i> dangerous.</p>
<p>Harry had caught his mind trying to argue itself into believing
that it was safe.</p>
<p>And sure, the whole thing <i>could</i> work, but...</p>
<p>But even leaving out that rationalists weren't ever allowed to
argue themselves into things, Harry knew he couldn't possibly have
argued himself into estimating less than a 20% probability of
dying.</p>
<p><i>Lose,</i> said Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><i>Lose</i>, said the voice of Professor Quirrell in his
mind.</p>
<p><i>Lose,</i> said his mental model of Hermione and Professor
McGonagall and Professor Flitwick and Neville Longbottom and, well,
basically everyone Harry knew except for Fred and George, who would
have gone for it in a hot second.</p>
<p>He should just go find Dumbledore and turn himself in. He
should, he really really should, it was the only <i>sane</i> thing
to do at this point.</p>
<p>And if it'd been only Harry on the mission, only his own life
that'd been at stake, he would have; he surely would have.</p>
<p>The part that was almost causing him to lose his concentration
on the partial Transfiguration he was performing, the part that was
threatening to open him to the Dementors...</p>
<p>...was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still a snake.</p>
<p>If Professor Quirrell went to Azkaban for his part in the
escape, he would die. He probably wouldn't last even a week. He was
that sensitive.</p>
<p>It was that simple.</p>
<p>If Harry <i>lost</i> here...</p>
<p>He lost Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p><i>Even though he's probably evil,</i> said the Hufflepuff part
of him quietly. <i>Even so?</i></p>
<p>It wasn't a decision that Harry had made in any conscious way.
He just couldn't do it. Losing was for House points, not
<i>people.</i></p>
<p><i>If you think your own life is valuable enough that you're not
willing to take on an eighty percent probability of dying in order
to protect all the prisoners in Azkaban,</i> his Slytherin side
observed, <i>there's no way you can justify taking a twenty percent
risk to your life to save Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. The
math doesn't add up, you can't be assigning consistent utilities
over outcomes here.</i></p>
<p>The logical side of him noted that Slytherin had just won the
argument.</p>
<p>Harry kept the Form in his mind, kept on casting the spell. He
could always just abort the mission when he was <i>done</i> with
the Transfiguration, he didn't want to lose the effort he'd already
invested.</p>
<p>And then Harry thought of something else that suddenly made it
very hard to keep the magic going, very hard to keep up his
resistance to the Dementors.</p>
<p><i>What if the portkey doesn't take us where Professor Quirrell
said it did?</i></p>
<p>It was obvious in retrospect the moment he thought about it.</p>
<p>Even if the planned escape went completely right, even if the
Muggle device worked and <i>didn't</i> explode and <i>didn't</i>
interact badly with the mated magic item, even if the Aurors didn't
get in a lucky shot, even if Harry made it far enough away from
Azkaban to use the portkey...</p>
<p>...there might not be a psychiatric healer at the end of it.</p>
<p>That was something Harry had believed when he'd trusted
Professor Quirrell, and he'd forgotten to re-evaluate it after
Professor Quirrell was no longer to be trusted.</p>
<p><i>You can't do this,</i> said Hufflepuff. <i>At this point
we're talking mere stupidity.</i></p>
<p>Cold seemed to spread through the room, but Harry kept the
Transfiguration going, even as his resistance against the Dementors
faltered.</p>
<p><i>I can't lose Professor Quirrell.</i></p>
<p><i>He tried to kill a police officer,</i> said Hufflepuff.
<i>You already lost him, in that moment. Bellatrix is probably just
what everyone thinks she is. Just take your Cloak back, go find
Dumbledore and tell him you were tricked.</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> thought Harry desperately, <i>not without talking to
Professor Quirrell, there might be an explanation, I don't know,
maybe he was standing far enough away from my Patronus that the
Dementors got to him... I don't understand, it doesn't make sense
on any hypothesis, why he would do that... I can't
just...<br /></i></p>
<p>Harry turned his mind away from that chain of thought before it
completely broke his resistance to the fear, because he couldn't
think of feeding Professor Quirrell to Dementors while staying
resolved against Death, it was a cognitive impossibility.</p>
<p><i>Your reasoning is artificially impaired,</i> observed the
logical part of him calmly, <i>find a way to unimpair it.</i></p>
<p><i>All right, let's just generate alternatives,</i> Harry
thought. <i>Not choose, not weigh, certainly not commit... just
think about what else I might be able to do besides the original
plan.</i></p>
<p>And Harry went on cutting the hole in the wall. He was using
partial Transfiguration on a thin cylindrical shell of metal, two
meters in diameter and half a millimeter thick, running all the way
through the wall. He was Transfiguring that half-millimeter
thickness of metal into motor oil. Motor oil was a liquid and you
weren't to Transfigure liquids because they might evaporate, but he
and Bellatrix and the snake all had Bubble-Head Charms. And Harry
would cast Finite on the oil immediately after, dispelling his own
Transfiguration...</p>
<p>...as soon as the separated and lubricated hunk of metal slid
out of the wall and onto the floor of their cell, he'd slanted it
so gravity would pull it in, once the Transfiguration was done.</p>
<p>If Harry and Bellatrix <i>didn't</i> exit on his broomstick
through the resulting hole in the wall...</p>
<p>Harry's brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a
surface cover over the hole in the wall, leaving a space for
Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell to hide in, wearing the Cloak,
while Harry turned himself in. And Professor Quirrell would
eventually wake up, and he and Bellatrix could try to figure out
how to exit Azkaban on their own.</p>
<p>It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still
be a huge hunk of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give
it away.</p>
<p>And then Harry's brain saw the obvious.</p>
<p><i>Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route you
invented. You stay behind, and turn yourself in.</i></p>
<p>Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were
at stake.</p>
<p>They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.</p>
<p>And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go
with them.</p>
<p>A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness
that had been wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated.
Yes, that was it, that was the creative outside-the-box route, that
was the hidden third alternative. The falseness of the dilemma was
obvious in retrospect. If Harry turned himself in, he <i>didn't</i>
have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell. If Bellatrix and
Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escape route, Harry
<i>didn't</i> need to go with them.</p>
<p>Harry didn't even need to face the embarrassment of admitting
he'd been tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory.
Everyone would just assume he'd been kidnapped, including Harry
himself. Admittedly, there was no plausible reason why the Dark
Lord would ever ask Bellatrix to do that; but Harry could simply
smile and tell Bellatrix she wasn't allowed to know, and that would
be that...</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down
Azkaban, as had the other two teams on the other two spirals.
Amelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the
criminals hiding on the second-to-lowest floor, part of her wished
Dumbledore had thought to check that specific floor more carefully
and part of her was glad he hadn't.</p>
<p>And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny 'tink' noise
coming from far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the
second-to-lowest floor, say.</p>
<p>Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she
managed to stop herself.</p>
<p>The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, "Since
you asked it, Amelia," and went off yet again.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Finite Incantatem,"</i> Harry said to the oil coating the
giant chunk of metal on the floor. He hardly heard himself speak,
his ears were still ringing from the gigantic thud of the solid
metal sliding out of the wall and falling. (He should have put up a
Quieting Charm, in retrospect, though that wouldn't have stopped
the noise from spreading through the solid metal floor.) And then
Harry said it again, "<i>Finite Incantatem</i>" to the oil coating
the two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect wide; it was
his own magic Harry was canceling, which made the spell almost
effortless. Harry was feeling a bit tired now, but that was the
last use of magic he would need. He hadn't even <i>needed</i> to do
it, really, but Harry didn't want to leave Transfigured liquid
lying around, and he didn't want to betray the secret of partial
Transfiguration either.</p>
<p>It seemed very... <i>inviting,</i> that two-meter hole leading
to freedom.</p>
<p>The light from outside coming in... wasn't exactly the Sun
shining on his face, but it was brighter than anything of Azkaban's
interior.</p>
<p>Harry <i>was</i> tempted to just go with, just hop on the
broomstick with Bellatrix and the snake. Chances were that they
<i>would</i> get out safely. And if they <i>did</i> get out safely,
and Harry came with, then he and Professor Quirrell could go back
in time and look perfectly innocent, everything could go back to
normal.</p>
<p>If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in... then even if
everyone assumed Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied
to Professor McGonagall's Patronus at wandpoint... even if Harry
himself got off lightly, well...</p>
<p>It wasn't likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching
at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his
career, in February of the school year.</p>
<p>And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it
would be slow and painful.</p>
<p>But staying behind was the sensible, safe, <i>sane</i> thing to
do, and Harry was feeling more relaxed than regretful.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a
final time -</p>
<p>And there was a hiss, a weak hiss, a hiss that sounded slow and
confused, and the hiss said,</p>
<p><i>"What wass... that noisse?</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal
door and opened it, already knowing from memory that the cells
within were empty.</p>
<p>Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then,
before he moved on; it would be little enough exertion in total,
with so few cells left to check.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>Teacher,</i>" Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling up in
him, all at once. He knew, though he could not see, that the green
snake around Bellatrix's shoulders, was slowly lifting its head to
look around. "<i>Are you... all right, teacher?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Teacher?</i>" came the weak, confused hiss. "<i>Where iss
thiss?</i></p>
<p>"<i>Prisson,</i>" Harry hissed, "<i>the prisson with
life-eaterss, we were to resscue a woman, you and I. You tried to
sslay the protector man, I blocked your killing cursse, there was a
ressonance between uss... you fell unconssciouss, I had to defeat
the protector man mysself... my guardian Charm wass disspelled, the
life-eaterss could tell the protectorss that the woman had
esscaped. There iss ssomeone here who can ssensse my guardian
Charm, probably the sschoolmasster... so had to disspell my
guardian Charm, find different way to hide you and the woman from
life-eaterss without guardian Charm, learn to protect mysself
without guardian Charm, sscare off life-eaterss without guardian
Charm, then devisse new esscape plan for you and the woman, and
finally, cut hole in thick metal wall of prisson even though I am
only firsst-year sstudent. No time to explain, you musst go now. If
we never meet again, teacher, then I was glad to know you for a
time, even though you are probably evil. It iss good to have the
chance to ssay thiss much: Goodbye.</i>"</p>
<p>And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix,
saying simply, "Get on."</p>
<p>He had decided to keep the memories. For one thing, they were
important. For another, he and the Defense Professor had started
planning this a week ago, and Harry wasn't about to obliterate the
whole last week, <i>or</i> explain to Bellatrix exactly what needed
to be Obliviated. Harry could probably fool Veritaserum, and if
Dumbledore insisted that Harry drop his Occlumency shields for a
deeper examination... well, Harry had acted heroically
throughout.</p>
<p>"<i>Sstop!</i>" said the snake. Its voice was stronger now.
"<i>Sstop, sstop, sstop! What do you mean, goodbye?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Esscape plan iss rissky,</i>" said Harry. "<i>My life iss
not at sstake, only yourss and herss. Sso I am sstaying, turning
mysself in -</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" said the snake. The hiss was forceful. "<i>Musst
not! Not permitted!</i>"</p>
<p>Bellatrix mounted the broomstick; Harry could sense (but never
see) her head turning to look at him, she said no word. Awaiting
him, perhaps, or merely awaiting his orders.</p>
<p>"<i>No longer trusst you,</i>" Harry said simply. "<i>Not ssince
you tried to sslay the protector man.</i>"</p>
<p>And the snake hissed, "<i>I did not sseek to sslay the protector
man! Are you fool, boy? Sslaying him would not make ssensse, evil
or no!</i>"</p>
<p>The Earth ceased to turn on its axis, paused in its orbit around
the Sun.</p>
<p>The snake's hiss was now more furious than anything Harry had
ever heard from the human Professor Quirrell. "<i>Sslay him? Had I
ssought to sslay him he would have been dead within ssecondss, fool
boy, he wass no match for me! I ssought to ssubdue, to dominate,
force him to drop sshieldss upon hiss mind, needed to read him, to
know who awaited hiss reply, learn detailss for memory sspell
-"</i></p>
<p>"<i>You casst killing cursse!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Knew he would dodge!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Wass hiss life worth sso little? What if he did not
dodge?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Would have pusshed him out of the way with own magic, fool
boy!</i>"</p>
<p>Again the pause in the planet's spin. Harry hadn't thought of
that.</p>
<p>"<i>Witlesss dunce of a plotter,</i>" hissed the snake, so
angrily that the hisses seemed to overlap and slither over each
other's tails, "<i>clever imbecile, cunning idiot, fool of an
untrained Sslytherin, your missplaced misstrust hass ruined
-"</i></p>
<p>"<i>Thiss iss not a fair time to argue,</i>" Harry observed
mildly. The surge of relief trying to flood through him was
canceled by the increased tension. "<i>Ssince I cannot get angry at
you properly, without opening mysself to life-eaterss. Musst russh,
ssomeone may have heard noisse -"</i></p>
<p>"<i>Explain esscape plan,</i>" the snake said imperiously.
"<i>Sswiftly!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry explained. Parseltongue didn't have words for the Muggle
technology, but Harry described the function and Professor Quirrell
seemed to understand.</p>
<p>There were a few short hisses, the snakish equivalent of a bark
of surprised laughter, and then, snapped commands. "<i>Tell woman
to look away, casst sspell of ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside
door. Will transsform mysself, make few sswift improvementss to
your invention, give woman emergency potion sso sshe can sshield
uss, transsform back before you disspell Charm. Plan will be
ssafer, then.</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>And am I to believe,</i>" Harry hissed, <i>"that healer for
woman truly awaitss uss?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I am evil. To end usse of you
here iss obvioussly not what I planned. Misssion iss target of

meant to be unnoticed, hid when left eating-place. Obvioussly you
will ssee persson pretending to be healer on arrival! Go back to
eating-place afterward, original plan carriess on
undissturbed!</i>"</p>
<p>Harry stared at the invisible snake.</p>
<p>On the one hand, saying it like that made Harry feel rather
dumb.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, it wasn't exactly reassuring.</p>
<p>"<i>Sso,</i>" Harry hissed, "<i>what iss your plan for me,
precissely?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>You ssaid no time,</i>" came the snake's hiss, "<i>but plan
iss for you to rule country, obvioussly, even your young noble
friend hass undersstood that by now, assk him on return if you
wissh. Will ssay no more now, iss time to fly, not sspeak.</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from
behind which came a endless dead mutter, "I'm not serious, I'm not
serious, I'm not serious..." The red-golden phoenix on his shoulder
was already screaming urgently, and the old wizard was already
wincing, when -</p>
<p>Another cry pierced the corridor, phoenix-like but not the true
phoenix's call.</p>
<p>The wizard's head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature
on his other shoulder, even as ephemeral and substanceless talons
launched the spell-entity into the air.</p>
<p>The false phoenix flew down the corridor.</p>
<p>The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young
man of sixty.</p>
<p>The true phoenix screamed once, twice, and a third time,
hovering before the metal door; and then, when it became clear that
its master would not return for all its calling, flew reluctantly
after.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Professor Quirrell had assumed his true form, this time -
Polyjuice only lasted for an hour without redosing - and though the
Defense Professor was pale, leaning against the metal bars of the
nearest cell, his magic was strong enough to seize his wand without
a word, even as Bellatrix doffed the Cloak and placed it obediently
in Harry's waiting hand. The sense of doom was building once more,
though not in full force, as the Defense Professor's power
returned, the fringes of its vast force clashing with Harry's
slight childish aura.</p>
<p>Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it
to the observing wizard, and then a Finite from Harry turned all
his hard work back into an ice cube. Professor Quirrell could not
cast spells on something Harry had Transfigured, for that would be
an interaction, however slight, between their magics, but -</p>
<p>Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own
Transfigured version of the Muggle device. A single barked word and
a sweep of his wand, and the residue of glue was gone from the
magical item; three more incantations later, the magical and
technological were fused together as though into a single thing,
and Charms of Unbreakability and flawless function had been cast
upon the Muggle device.</p>
<p>(Harry felt a lot better about doing this under adult
supervision.)</p>
<p>A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and
Harry both commanded, "Drink," as though speaking in the same
voice. The emaciated woman had already been lifting it to her lips,
without waiting; for it was evident to anyone that this snake
Animagus was a servant of the Dark Lord, and a powerful and trusted
one.</p>
<p>Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility
over his head.</p>
<p>A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense
Professor's wand, scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge
chunk of metal that lay in the room's midst; as Harry had
requested, saying that the method he'd used might identify him.</p>
<p>"Left-hand glove," Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth,
and put it on.</p>
<p>A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear upon
Bellatrix's shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her
hand, and something like handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman
finished drinking the potion.</p>
<p>A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix's pale
face, she straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far
more dangerous...</p>
<p>...small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears...</p>
<p>(Harry decided not to think about that part.)</p>
<p>...and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter that
rang much too loudly amid the small prison cells of Azkaban.</p>
<p>(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall
unconscious and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the
potion she had taken; but for just a few moments she would regain
perhaps a twentieth part of the power she had once wielded.)</p>
<p>The Defense Professor threw his wand toward Bellatrix, and an
instant later blurred into a green snake.</p>
<p>An instant after <i>that</i> the Dementors' fear returned to the
room.</p>
<p>Bellatrix flinched only slightly, caught the wand, and gestured
without a word; the snake flew up and was inserted into the harness
on her back.</p>
<p>Harry said "Up!" to the broomstick.</p>
<p>Bellatrix attached the wand to the holster on her hand.</p>
<p>Harry leaped onto the two-person broomstick in the lead
position.</p>
<p>Bellatrix followed behind him, she took the cufflike devices on
her wrists and chained her hands to the grips of the broomstick,
even as Harry's right hand shoved his wand into his pouch.</p>
<p>And the three shot forward through the hole in the wall -</p>
<p>- emerging into the open air, directly above the Dementors' pit,
in the interior of the vast triangular prism that was Azkaban, the
blue sky now clearly visible above them, shining down its
daylight.</p>
<p>Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and
toward the center of the triangular space. His left hand, gloved to
prevent direct contact between his skin and something which
Professor Quirrell had Transfigured, held the switch of the control
on the Muggle device.</p>
<p>Far above them, distant shouts rang out.</p>
<p><i>All right, you primitive screwheads!</i></p>
<p>Aurors on fast racing broomsticks angled out of the sky, diving
straight down toward them, faint sparks of light already blazing
downward as the first shots were fired.</p>
<p><i>Listen up!<br /></i></p>
<p>"Protego Maximus!" shouted Bellatrix in a mighty, cracked voice,
followed by a cackling laugh as a shimmering blue field surrounded
them.</p>
<p><i>You see this?</i></p>
<p>From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred
Dementors rose into the air, appearing to some as a great mass of
corpses, a flying graveyard; appearing to another as a conglomerate
of absences that seemed to form one vast rip in the world as they
slid upward.</p>
<p><i>This...</i></p>
<p>The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible
incantation, and a great blast of white-golden fire shot out of the
hole in Azkaban's wall, shapeless for only a moment before it began
to form wings.</p>
<p><i>Is...</i></p>
<p>And the Aurors activated the Anti-Anti-Gravity Jinx that had
been built into the wards of Azkaban, disabling all flying spells
whose enchantment had not been cast with the recently changed
passphrase.</p>
<p>The lift on Harry's broom switched off.</p>
<p>Gravity, on the other hand, stayed on.</p>
<p>Their broom's upward rise slowed, started to decelerate, began
the process of turning into a fall.</p>
<p><i>My...</i></p>
<p>But the enchantments that kept the broom pointed in a direction
and allowed steering, the enchantments that kept the riders
attached and somewhat protected them from acceleration,
<i>those</i> enchantments were still functioning.</p>
<p><i>BROOMSTICK!</i></p>
<p>Harry hit the ignition switch on the General Technics made,
model <i>Berserker PFRC</i>, N-class, ammonium perchlorate
composite propellant, solid-fuel rocket that had been mated to his
Nimbus X200 two-person broomstick.</p>
<p>And there was noise.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="59">Chapter 59</h2><h3>TSPE, Curiosity, Pt
9</h3>
<p>Broomsticks had been invented during what a Muggle would have
called the Dark Ages, supposedly by a legendary witch named
Celestria Relevo, allegedly the great-great-granddaughter of
Merlin.</p>
<p>Celestria Relevo, or whichever person or group had really
invented those enchantments, hadn't known a darned thing about
Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Broomsticks, therefore, worked by Aristotelian physics.</p>
<p>They went where you pointed them.</p>
<p>If you wanted to move straight forward, you pointed them
straight forward; you didn't worry about keeping some of the thrust
going downward to cancel out the effect of gravity.</p>
<p>If you turned a broomstick, all of its new velocity was in the
new direction of pointing, it didn't go sideways based on its old
momentum.</p>
<p>Broomsticks had maximum speeds, not maximum accelerations. Not
because of anything to do with air resistance, but because a
broomstick had some maximum Aristotelian impetus its enchantments
could exert.</p>
<p>Harry had never explicitly <i>noticed</i> that before, despite
being dextrous enough to get the best grades in flying class.
Broomsticks worked so much like the human mind <i>instinctively
expected them to work</i> that his brain had managed to <i>entirely
overlook their physical absurdity.</i> Harry, on his first Thursday
of broomstick lessons, had been distracted by more
interesting-seeming phenomena, words written on paper and a glowing
red ball. So his brain had simply suspended its disbelief, marked
the reality of broomsticks as accepted, and proceeded to have its
fun, without ever once <i>thinking of the question</i> whose answer
would have been obvious. For it is a sad fact that we only ever
<i>think</i> about a tiny fraction of all the phenomena we
encounter...</p>
<p>That is the story of how Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was
almost killed by his own lack of curiosity.</p>
<p>Because rockets did <i>not</i> work by Aristotelian physics.</p>
<p>Rockets did <i>not</i> work like a human mind instinctively
thought a flying thing should work.</p>
<p>A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, did <i>not</i> move
like the magical broomsticks upon which Harry was such a very good
flyer.</p>
<p>None of this actually went through Harry's mind at the time.</p>
<p>For one thing, the loudest noise he'd ever heard in his life was
preventing him from hearing himself think.</p>
<p>For another thing, accelerating upward at four gravities meant
that he had around two and a half seconds, total, to go from the
bottom to the top of Azkaban.</p>
<p>And even if they were two and a half of the <i>longest</i>
seconds in the history of Time, that wasn't enough room to do much
thinking.</p>
<p>There was time only to see the lights of the Aurors' curses
arrowing down at him, slightly angle the broomstick to avoid them,
realize that the broomstick was simply continuing on with mostly
the same momentum instead of going in the direction he pointed it,
and activate the wordless concepts</p>
<p>*<i>crap*</i></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><i>*Newton*</i></p>
<p>whereupon Harry angled the broomstick much harder and then they
started to very quickly approach the wall so he angled it back the
other way and there were more lights coming down and the Dementors
were sliding smoothly up toward them along with some kind of giant
winged creature of white-golden flame so Harry wrenched the
broomstick back toward the sky but now he was still sliding toward
another wall so he tilted the broom slightly and he stopped
approaching but he was too close so he tilted it again and then the
distant Aurors on their broomsticks weren't very distant at all and
he was going to crash into that woman so he spun his broomstick
straight away from her and then in another instant he realized his
rocket was an extremely powerful flamethrower and in a fraction of
a second it would be pointing directly at the Auror so he spun the
broomstick sideways as he kept going up and he couldn't remember if
it was pointing at any Aurors now but at least it wasn't pointing
at <i>her</i></p>
<p>Harry missed another Auror by about a meter, zipping past him on
a sideways-pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would later
guess, around 300 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>If there were any screams of roasted Aurors he didn't hear them,
but this was not evidence one way or another, because all that
Harry was hearing at the moment was an extremely loud noise.</p>
<p>A couple of <i>calmer if not quieter</i> seconds later, there
didn't seem to be any Aurors around, or any Dementors, or any giant
winged flame creatures, and the vast and terrible edifice of
Azkaban looked surprisingly tiny from this height.</p>
<p>Harry got the broomstick pointed toward the Sun, faintly visible
through the clouds, it wasn't high in the sky at this time of day
and month of winter, and the broomstick accelerated for another two
seconds in that direction and picked up an amazing amount of speed
very quickly before the solid-fuel rocket burned itself out.</p>
<p>After that, once Harry could hear himself think again, when
there was only the howling wind from their ridiculous speed, and
Harry's enchantment-assisted fingers gripping the broomstick were
merely resisting the decelerating drag of moving way faster than
terminal velocity, <i>that</i> was when Harry actually thought all
that stuff about Newtonian mechanics and Aristotelian physics and
broomsticks and rocketry and the importance of curiosity and how he
was never going to do anything this Gryffindor ever again or at
least not until after he learned the Dark Lord's secret of
immortality and <i>why</i> had he listened to Professor Quirinus
"<i>I asssure you, boy, I would not attempt thisss if I did not
anticipate my own ssurvival</i>" Quirrell instead of Professor
Michael "Son, if you try anything to do with rockets on your own, I
mean <i>anything whatsoever</i> without a trained professonal
watching, you will die and that will make Mum sad"
Verres-Evans.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"<i>WHAT?</i>" shrieked Amelia at the mirror.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The wind had died down to a bearable level as the air resistance
slowed them, giving Harry plenty of opportunity to listen to the
buzzing, ringing sound that seemed to fill his whole brain.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had been supposed to cast a Quieting Charm on
the rocket exhaust... apparently there were limits to what Quieting
Charms could do... in retrospect, Harry should have Transfigured a
pair of earplugs, not just trusted to the Quieting Charm, though
that probably wouldn't have been enough either...</p>
<p>Well, magical healing probably had something to treat permanent
hearing damage.</p>
<p>No, really, magical healing probably had something to treat
that. He'd seen students go to Madam Pomfrey with injuries that
sounded a lot worse...</p>
<p><i>Is there some way of transplanting an imaginary personality
to someone else's head?</i> asked Hufflepuff. <i>I don't want to
live in yours anymore.</i></p>
<p>Harry shoved it all into the back of his mind, there really
wasn't anything he could do about it right now. Was there anything
he <i>should</i> be worrying about -</p>
<p>Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering for the first time to
check whether Bellatrix or Professor Quirrell had been blown off
the broomstick.</p>
<p>But the green snake was still in its harness, and the emaciated
woman was still clinging to the broomstick, her face still charged
with unhealthy color and her eyes still bright and dangerous. Her
shoulders were shaking like she was laughing hysterically, and her
lips were moving as though to shout, but no sound was coming out
-</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Harry took off the hood of his cloak, tapped his ears to let her
know he couldn't hear.</p>
<p>Whereupon Bellatrix grasped her wand, pointed it at Harry, and
suddenly the ringing in his ears diminished, he could hear her.</p>
<p>A moment later he regretted it; the imprecations she was
screaming at Azkaban, Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius,
Bartemy Couch, something called the Order of the Phoenix, and all
who stood in the way of her Dark Lord, et cetera, were not suitable
for younger and more sensitive listeners; and her laughter was
hurting his newly healed ears.</p>
<p>"Enough, Bella," Harry finally said, and her voice stopped on
the instant.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry pulled the Cloak back over his head,
just on general principles; and realized in the same instant that
they might have telescopes down there or something, in retrospect
pulling down his hood for even a moment had been an incredibly dumb
move, he hoped the whole mission didn't end up failing because of
that one error...</p>
<p><i>We're not really cut out for this, are we?</i> observed
Slytherin.</p>
<p><i>Hey,</i> Hufflepuff objected in sheer reflex, <i>we can't
expect to do anything perfectly the first time, we probably just
need more practice FORGET I SAID THAT.</i></p>
<p>Harry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around with a
puzzled, wondering look on her face. Her head kept turning,
turning.</p>
<p>And finally Bellatrix said, her voice now lower, "My Lord, where
are we?"</p>
<p><i>What do you mean?</i> was what Harry wanted to say, but the
Dark Lord would never admit to not understanding anything, so Harry
replied, dryly, "We are on a broomstick."</p>
<p><i>Does she think she's dead, that this is Heaven?</i></p>
<p>Bellatrix's hands were still chained to the broomstick, so it
was only a finger that came up and pointed when she said, "What is
<i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry followed the direction of her finger and saw... nothing in
particular, actually...</p>
<p>Then Harry realized. After they'd gone up high enough, there
hadn't been any clouds to obscure it any more.</p>
<p>"That is the Sun, dear Bella."</p>
<p>It came out remarkably controlled, the Dark Lord sounding
perfectly calm and maybe a little impatient with her, even as the
tears started down Harry's cheeks.</p>
<p>In the endless cold, in the pitch blackness, the Sun would
surely have been...</p>
<p>A happy memory...</p>
<p>Bellatrix's head kept turning.</p>
<p>"And the fluffy things?" she said.</p>
<p>"Clouds."</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Bellatrix said, "But what <i>are</i>
they?"</p>
<p>Harry didn't answer her, there was no way his voice could have
been steady, would have been steady, it was all he could do to keep
his breathing perfectly regular while he cried.</p>
<p>After a while, Bellatrix breathed, so softly Harry almost didn't
hear, "Pretty..."</p>
<p>Her face slowly relaxed, the color leaving its paleness almost
as quickly as it had arrived.</p>
<p>Her skeletal body slumped down against the broomstick.</p>
<p>The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly from the strap attached to
her unmoving hand.</p>
<p><i>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING -</i></p>
<p>Harry's mind remembered then, the Pepper-Up potion came at a
cost; Bellatrix would <i>ssleep for a conssiderable time,</i>
Professor Quirrell had said.</p>
<p>And in the same instant another part of Harry became utterly
convinced, looking back at the chalk-white emaciated woman, seeming
deader in the bright sunlight than anything Harry had ever seen
alive, that she <i>was</i> dead, that she had just uttered her last
word, that Professor Quirrell had misjudged the dosage -</p>
<p>- or deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix to guard their own escape
-</p>
<p><i>Is she breathing?</i></p>
<p>Harry couldn't see if she was breathing.</p>
<p>There was no way, on the broomstick, to reach back and take her
pulse.</p>
<p>Harry looked ahead to make sure they weren't about to run into
any flying rocks, kept on steering the broomstick toward the Sun,
the invisible boy and the possibly dead woman riding off into the
afternoon, while his fingers gripped the wood so hard they turned
white.</p>
<p>He couldn't reach back and perform artificial respiration.</p>
<p>He couldn't use anything from his healer's kit.</p>
<p><i>Trust Professor Quirrell to have not endangered her?</i></p>
<p>Strange, it was strange, that even genuinely believing that
Professor Quirrell hadn't meant to kill the Auror (for it
<i>would</i> have been stupid), thinking of the Defense Professor's
reassurances no longer felt reassuring.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to Harry that he had yet to check -</p>
<p>Harry looked back, and hissed, "<i>Teacher?</i>"</p>
<p>The snake did not stir within its harness, and said no word.</p>
<p>...maybe the snake, not being an actual rider, hadn't been
protected from the acceleration. Or maybe coming that close to the
Dementors without a shield, even for a moment in Animagus form, had
knocked out the Defense Professor.</p>
<p>That wasn't good.</p>
<p>It was to have been Professor Quirrell who told Harry when it
was safe to use the portkey.</p>
<p>Harry steered the broomstick with whitened fingers, and thought,
he thought very hard for a small unmeasured length of time, during
which Bellatrix might or might not have been breathing, during
which Professor Quirrell himself might have already been
not-breathing for a while.</p>
<p>And Harry decided that while it was possible to recover from the
error of wasting the portkey in his possession, it was not possible
to recover from the error of letting a brain go too long without
oxygen.</p>
<p>So Harry took the next portkey in the sequence from his pouch,
as he slowed his broomstick to a halt in the bright blue air (Harry
didn't know, when he thought about it, whether a portkey's ability
to adjust for the Earth's rotation also included the ability to
match velocity in general with its new surroundings), touched the
portkey to the broomstick, and...</p>
<p>Harry paused, still holding the twig, the mate of the twig he
had snapped what seemed like two weeks ago. He was feeling a sudden
reluctance; his brain seemed to have learned the rule, by some
purely neural process of negative reinforcement, that Snapping
Twigs Is A Bad Idea.</p>
<p>But that wasn't actually logical, so Harry snapped the twig
anyway.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door,
causing Amelia to drop the mirror she was holding and spin around
with her wand in hand, and then that door burst open to reveal
Albus Dumbledore, standing there in front of a great smoking hole
in the prison wall.</p>
<p>"Amelia," said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his
customary levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his
half-moon glasses. "I must leave Azkaban and I must do so
<i>now</i>. Is there any faster way than a broomstick to get beyond
the wards?"</p>
<p>"No -"</p>
<p>"Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!"</p>
<p>The place where Amelia <i>wanted</i> to be was with the Auror
who had been injured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been.</p>
<p>What she <i>needed</i> to do was find out what Dumbledore
knew.</p>
<p>"You!" the old witch barked at the team around her. "Keep
clearing the corridors until you're at bottom, they may not all
have escaped yet!" And then, to the old wizard, "Two broomsticks.
You can brief me once we're in the air."</p>
<p>There was a match of stares, but not a long one.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>A sickeningly hard yank caught at Harry's abdomen, considerably
harder than the yank that had transported him to Azkaban, and this
time the distance traversed was great enough that he could hear an
instant of silence, watch the unseeable space between spaces, in
the crack between one place and another.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly
occluded by a raincloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the
direction of the wind and faster than the wind.</p>
<p>"Who's behind it?" shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a
pace away from her.</p>
<p>"One of two people," Dumbledore said back, "I know not, at this
instant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second,
we are all in far greater trouble."</p>
<p>Amelia didn't spare any breath for sighs. "When will you
know?"</p>
<p>The old wizard's voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising
above the wind. "Three things they need for perfection, if it is
that one: The flesh of the Dark Lord's most faithful servant, the
blood of the Dark Lord's greatest foe, and access to a certain
grave. I had thought Harry Potter safe, with their attempt on
Azkaban all but failed - though I still set guards upon him - but
now I am fearful indeed. They have access to Time, someone with a
Time-Turner is sending messages for them; and I suspect the kidnap
attempt on Harry Potter has already taken place some hours ago.
Which is why <i>we</i> have not heard about it, being in Azkaban
where Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own future,
you see."</p>
<p>"And if it is the other?" shouted Amelia. What she had heard
already was worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark
rituals, and centering on the dead Dark Lord himself.</p>
<p>The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only
shook his head.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>When the portkey's yank had subsided, the Sun was only just
peeking over the horizon, looking more like dawn than sunset, as
their broom hovered low above a brief expanse of dark-orange rock
and sand, arranged into lumpy hills like someone had kneaded the
land's dough a few times and then forgotten to roll it flat. In the
near distance, waves rolled past in an endless vista of water,
though the ground over which the broomstick hovered was above sea
level by meters at the least.</p>
<p>Harry blinked at the dawn colors, and then realized the portkey
had been international.</p>
<p>"Oy!" came a brisk, female shout from behind him, and Harry spun
the broomstick to look. A middle-aged lady was holding up one hand
to her mouth in a deliberate calling gesture, and bustling forward.
Her kindly features, narrow eyes, and umber skin marked a race
unfamiliar to Harry; she was clad in brilliant purple robes of a
style Harry had never seen before; and when her lips opened again
she spoke with an accent that Harry couldn't place, for he was not
widely traveled. "Where were you? You're two hours late! I almost
gave up on the lot of you... hello?"</p>
<p>There was a brief pause. Harry's thoughts seemed to be moving
oddly, too slow, everything felt distant, like there was a thick
pane of glass between himself and the world, and another thick pane
of glass between himself and his feelings, so that he could see,
but not touch. It had come over him upon seeing the dawn's light
and the kindly witch, and thinking that it all seemed like a proper
end to the adventure.</p>
<p>Then the witch was rushing forward and drawing her wand; a
muttered word severed the cuffs that bound the emaciated woman to
the broomstick, and Bellatrix was being floated down onto the sandy
rock with her skeletal arms and pale legs dangling like lifeless
things. "Oh, Merlin," whispered the witch, "Merlin, Merlin,
Merlin..."</p>
<p><i>She appears concerned,</i> thought an abstract, distant thing
between two panes of glass. <i>Is that what a real healer would
say, or is it what someone told to put on a performance would
say?</i></p>
<p>As though it wasn't Harry who spoke, but some other part of
himself behind yet another pane of glass, a whisper came from his
lips. "The green snake on her back is an Animagus." Not high the
whisper, not cold, only quiet. "He is unconscious."</p>
<p>The witch's head twitched up, to look at where that voice had
seemed to speak out of empty air, and then looked back down at
Bellatrix. "You're not Mister Jaffe."</p>
<p>"That would be the Animagus," whispered Harry's lips. <i>Oh,</i>
thought the Harry behind glass, listening to the sound of his own
lips, <i>that makes sense; Professor Quirrell must have used a
different name.</i></p>
<p>"Since when is <i>he</i> a - bah, forget it." The witch laid her
wand on the snake's nose for a moment, then shook her head sharply.
"Nothing wrong with him that a day's rest won't cure.
<i>Her...</i>"</p>
<p>"Can you wake him up now?" whispered Harry's lips. <i>Is that a
good idea?</i> thought Harry, but his lips definitely seemed to
think so.</p>
<p>Again the sharp headshake. "If an Innervate didn't work on him
-" began the witch.</p>
<p>"I did not attempt one," whispered Harry's lips.</p>
<p>"What? Why - oh, never mind. <i>Innervate.</i>"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then a snake slowly crawled out of its
harness. Slowly the green head came up, looked around.</p>
<p>A blur later, Professor Quirrell was standing, and a moment
later had sagged to his knees.</p>
<p>"Lie down," said the witch without looking up from Bellatrix.
"That you in there, Jeremy?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Defense Professor rather hoarsely, as he
carefully laid himself down on a relatively flat patch of sandy
orange rock. He was not so pale as Bellatrix, but his face was
bloodless in the dim dawn light. "Salutations, Miss
Camblebunker."</p>
<p>"I told you," said the witch, sharpness in her voice and a
slight smile on her face, "call me Crystal, this isn't Britain and
we'll have none of your formality here. <i>And</i> it's Doctor now,
not Miss."</p>
<p>"My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker." This was followed by a dry
chuckle.</p>
<p>The witch's smile grew a little wider, her voice that much
sharper. "Who's your friend?"</p>
<p>"You don't need to know." The Defense Professor's eyes were
closed, where he lay on the ground.</p>
<p>"How wrong did it go?"</p>
<p>Very dryly indeed: "You can read about it tomorrow in any
newspaper with an international section."</p>
<p>The witch's wand was tapping here, there, poking and prodding
all over Bellatrix's body. "I missed you, Jeremy."</p>
<p>"Truly?" said the Defense Professor, sounding slightly
surprised.</p>
<p>"Not even a tiny little bit. If I didn't owe you -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor started to laugh, and then it turned into
more of a coughing fit.</p>
<p><i>What do you think?</i> said Slytherin to the Inner Critic,
while Harry listened from behind the glass walls. <i>Performance,
or reality?</i></p>
<p><i>Can't tell,</i> said Harry's Inner Critic. <i>I'm not in top
critical form right now.</i></p>
<p><i>Can anyone think of a good probe to gather more
information?</i> said Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Again that whisper from the empty air above the broomstick:
"What is the chance of undoing all that was done to her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, let's see. Legilimency and unknown Dark rituals, ten years
for that to set in place, followed by ten years of Dementor
exposure? Undo <i>that?</i> You're out of your skull, Mister
Whoever-You-Are. The question is whether there's anything
<i>left,</i> and I'd call that maybe one chance in three -" The
witch suddenly cut herself off. Her voice, when it spoke again, was
quieter. "If you were her friend, before... then no, you're never
getting her back. Best understand that now."</p>
<p><i>I'm voting that this is a performance,</i> said the Inner
Critic. <i>She wouldn't just blurt all that out in response to one
question unless she was looking for an opportunity.</i></p>
<p><i>Noted, but I'm putting a low weight of confidence on
that,</i> said Ravenclaw. <i>It's very hard not to let your
suspicions control your perceptions when you're trying to weigh
evidence that subtle.</i></p>
<p>"What potion did you give her?" the witch said after opening
Bellatrix's mouth and peering inside, her wand flashing multiple
colors of illumination.</p>
<p>The man lying on the ground calmly said, "Pepper-Up -"</p>
<p>"<i>Were you out of your mind?</i>"</p>
<p>Again the coughing laugh.</p>
<p>"She'll sleep for a week if she's lucky," the witch said, and
clucked her tongue. "I'll owl you when she opens her eyes, I
suppose, so you can come back and talk her into that Unbreakable
Vow. Have you got anything to stop her from killing me on the spot,
if she manages to even move for another month?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took a sheet of paper
from his robes; a moment later, words began to appear on it,
accompanied by tiny wisps of smoke. When the smoke had stopped
rising, the paper floated over toward the woman.</p>
<p>The woman looked over the paper with raised eyebrows, gave a
sardonic snort. "This had better work, Jeremy, or my last will and
testament says that my whole estate goes into putting a bounty on
your head. Speaking of which -"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor reached again into his robes and tossed
the witch a bag that made a clinking sound. The witch caught it,
weighed it, made a pleased sound.</p>
<p>Then she stood up, and the pale skeletal woman floated off the
ground beside her. "I'm heading back," said the witch. "I can't
start my work here."</p>
<p>"Wait," said the Defense Professor, and with a gesture retrieved
his wand from Bellatrix's hand and harness. Then his hand pointed
the wand at Bellatrix, and moved in a small circular gesture,
accompanied by a quiet, "<i>Obliviate</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>That's it</i>," snapped the witch, "I'm taking her out of
here before anyone does her any more damage -" One arm came around
to hug the bony form of Bellatrix Black to her side, and they both
disappeared with the loud POP! of Apparition.</p>
<p>And there was silence in that lumpy place, but for the gentle
rush of the passing waves, and a little breath of wind.</p>
<p><i>I think the performance is finished,</i> said the Inner
Critic. <i>I give it two and a half out of five stars. She's
probably not a very experienced actor.</i></p>
<p><i>I wonder if a real healer would seem more fake than an actor
told to play one?</i> mused Ravenclaw.<i><br /></i></p>
<p>Like watching a television show, that was how it felt, like
watching a television show whose characters you didn't particularly
empathize with, that was all that could be seen and felt from
behind the glass walls.</p>
<p>Somehow, Harry managed to move his lips himself, send his own
voice out into the still dawn air, and then was surprised to hear
his own question. "How many different people are you, anyway?"</p>
<p>The pale man lying on the ground didn't laugh, but from the
broomstick Harry's eyes saw the sides of Professor Quirrell's lips
curling up, the edge of that familiar sardonic smile. "I cannot say
that I bothered keeping count. How many are you?"</p>
<p>It shouldn't have shaken the inner Harry so much, hearing that
response, and yet he felt - he felt - unstable, like his own center
had been subtracted -</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Harry's voice. It now sounded as distant and
detached as the fading Harry felt. "I'm going to faint in a few
seconds, I think."</p>
<p>"Use the fourth portkey I gave you, the one I said was our
fallback refuge," said the man lying on the ground, calmly but
swiftly. "It will be safer there. And continue wearing your
cloak."</p>
<p>Harry's free hand retrieved another twig from his pouch and
snapped it.</p>
<p>There was another portkey yank, internationally long, and then
he was somewhere black.</p>
<p>"<i>Lumos</i>," said Harry's lips, some part of him looking out
for the safety of the whole.</p>
<p>He was inside what looked like a Muggle warehouse, a deserted
one.</p>
<p>Harry's legs climbed off the broomstick, lay on the floor. His
eyes closed, and some tidy fraction of self willed his light to
fail, before the darkness took him.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>"Where will you go?" yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge
of the wards.</p>
<p>"Backward in time to protect Harry Potter," said the old wizard,
and before Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted
help, she felt the boundary of the wards as they crossed them.</p>
<p>There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phoenix
vanished, leaving behind the borrowed broomstick.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="60">Chapter 60</h2><h3>The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Pt 10</h3>
<p>"Wake."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp, a
jerking start of his prone body. He couldn't remember any dreams,
maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like
he'd only closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment
after.</p>
<p>"You must awaken," said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. "I gave
you as much time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at
least one use of your Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four
hours to Mary's Place, appearing in every way as though we have
done nothing interesting this day. I wished to speak to you before
then."</p>
<p>Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached,
and not only in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete.
Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his
unconscious brain had been too tired to discharge into a proper
nightmare.</p>
<p>Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing
the metal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the
emptiness tried to suck all life out of the world -</p>
<p>Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had
remained after fat and muscle faded -</p>
<p>A metal door -</p>
<p>A woman's voice -</p>
<p><i>No, I didn't mean it, please don't die -</i></p>
<p><i>I can't remember my children's names any more -</i></p>
<p><i>Don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't -</i></p>
<p>"What was that place?" Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed
out of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the
darkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black's voice
had been. "<i>What was that place? That wasn't a prison, that was
HELL!</i>"</p>
<p>"Hell?" said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. "You mean
the Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a
similarity."</p>
<p>"How -" Harry's voice was blocking, there was something huge
lodged in his throat. "How - how could they -" <i>People</i> had
built that place, someone had <i>made</i> Azkaban, they'd made it
on <i>purpose,</i> they'd done it <i>deliberately,</i> that woman,
she'd had children, children she wouldn't remember, some judge had
<i>decided</i> for that to happen to her, someone had needed to
<i>drag</i> her into that cell and lock its door while she
screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away <i>without
letting her out</i> -</p>
<p>"<i>HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?</i>"</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't they?" said the Defense Professor. A pale blue
light lit the warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete
ceiling, and a dusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting
some distance away from Harry, leaning his back against a painted
wall; the pale blue light turned the walls to glacier surfaces, the
dust on the floor to speckled snow, and the man himself had become
an ice sculpture, shrouded in darkness where his black robes lay
over him. "What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.</p>
<p>A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor's lips. "You
know, Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over
magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have
built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if
instead he began to find their suffering distasteful, why, he would
order Azkaban torn down the next day. As for those who did make
Azkaban, and those who do not tear it down, while preaching lofty
sermons and imagining themselves <i>not</i> to be villains... well,
Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking tea with them, or
taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my sensibilities less
offended by the Dark Lord."</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Harry said, his voice was shaking, he'd
read about the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the
ordinary college students who had turned sadistic as soon as they
were assigned the role of prison guards; only now he realized that
the experiment hadn't examined the right question, the one most
important question, they hadn't looked at the key people, not the
prison guards but <i>everyone else,</i> "I really don't understand,
Professor Quirrell, how can people just stand by and let this
happen, <i>why</i> is the country of magical Britain <i>doing
this</i> -" Harry's voice stopped.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes appeared to be the same color as
always, in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color
as Quirinus Quirrell's irises, those never-thawing chips of ice.
"Welcome, Mr. Potter, to your first encounter with the realities of
politics. What do the wretched creatures in Azkaban have to offer
any faction? Who would benefit from aiding them? A politician who
openly sided with them would associate themselves with criminals,
with weakness, with distasteful things that people would rather not
think about. Alternatively, the politician could demonstrate their
might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; to make a
display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, after
all. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back
the winner." A coldly amused laugh. "You see, Mr. Potter, no one
ever quite believes that <i>they</i> will go to Azkaban, so they
see no harm in it for themselves. As for what they inflict on
others... I suppose you were once told that people care about that
sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don't care in the
slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood you
would have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those
now prisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who
pledged to move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr.
Potter, that I see little hope for democracy as an effective form
of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims
complicit in their own destruction."</p>
<p>Harry's recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into
fragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his
consciousness, driving him back, step by step, over the precipice
where lurked some vast abyss; and he was trying to find something
to save himself, some clever retort that would refute the words,
but it did not come.</p>
<p>The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more
curiosity than command. "It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to
understand how Azkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men
care for what they, themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so
long as they do not expect it to redound upon themselves, their
cruelty and carelessness is without limit. All the other wizards of
this country are no different within than he who sought to rule
over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power and his...
frankness."</p>
<p>The boy's hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the
nails cut into his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was
pale you couldn't have seen that, for the dim blue light cast all
into ice or shadow. "You once offered to support me if my ambition
were to be the next Dark Lord. Is that why, Professor?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his
lips. "Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr. Potter, and you will
rule this country in time. Then you may tear down the prison that
democracy made, if you find that Azkaban still offends your
sensibilities. Like it or not, Mr. Potter, you have seen this day
that your own will conflicts with the will of this country's
populace, and that you do not bow your head and submit to their
decision when that occurs. So to them, whether or not they know it,
and whether or not you acknowledge it, you are their next Dark
Lord."</p>
<p>In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the Defense
Professor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of
their eyes reduced to similar colors, looking very much the same in
that light.</p>
<p>Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the
long-suppressed questions, the ones he'd told himself he was
putting on hold until the Ides of May. That had been a lie, Harry
now knew, a self-deception, he had kept silent for fear of what he
might hear. And now everything was coming forth from his lips, all
at once. "On our first day of class, you tried to convince my
classmates I was a killer."</p>
<p>"You are." Amusedly. "But if your question is why I <i>told</i>
them that, Mr. Potter, the answer is that you will find ambiguity a
great ally on your road to power. Give a sign of Slytherin on one
day, and contradict it with a sign of Gryffindor the next; and the
Slytherins will be enabled to believe what they wish, while the
Gryffindors argue themselves into supporting you as well. So long
as there is uncertainty, people can believe whatever seems to be to
their own advantage. And so long as you appear strong, so long as
you appear to be winning, their instincts will tell them that their
advantage lies with you. Walk always in the shadow, and light and
darkness both will follow."</p>
<p>"And," said the boy, his voice level, "just what do <i>you</i>
want out of all this?"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall from
where he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from
pale ice into dark pits like those of his snake form. "I wish for
Britain to grow strong under a strong leader; that <i>is</i> my
desire. As for my reasons why," Professor Quirrell smiled without
mirth, "I think they shall stay my own."</p>
<p>"The sense of doom that I feel around you." The words were
becoming harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and
closer to something terrible and forbidden. "You always knew what
it meant."</p>
<p>"I had several guesses," said Professor Quirrell, his expression
unreadable. "And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I
will tell you: it is <i>your</i> doom which flares when we come
near, not mine."</p>
<p>For once Harry's brain managed to mark this as a questionable
assertion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it
heard. "Why do you sometimes turn into a zombie?"</p>
<p>"Personal reasons," said Professor Quirrell with no humor at all
in his voice.</p>
<p>"What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?"</p>
<p>There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to
control his breathing, keep it steady.</p>
<p>Finally the Defense Professor shrugged, as though it were of no
account. "I all but spelled it out for you, Mr. Potter. I told you
everything you needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature
enough to consider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was
the Dark Lord's most powerful servant, her loyalty the most
assured; she was the single person most likely to be entrusted with
some part of the lost lore of Slytherin that should have been
yours."</p>
<p>Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something
terrible beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he
would say something that he really shouldn't say while the two of
them were alone in a deserted warehouse -</p>
<p>"But she <i>was</i> innocent," said the Defense Professor. He
was not smiling. "And the degree to which all her choices were
taken away from her, so that she never had a chance to suffer for
her <i>own</i> mistakes... it struck me as <i>excessive</i>, Mr.
Potter. If she tells you nothing of use -" The Defense Professor
gave another small shrug. "I shall not consider this day's work a
waste."</p>
<p>"How altruistic of you," Harry said coldly. "So if all wizards
are like You-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that,
then?"</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were still in shadow, dark pits
that could not be met. "Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has
sometimes amused me to play the part of a hero. Who knows but that
You-Know-Who would say the same."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth a final time -</p>
<p>And found that he couldn't say it, he couldn't ask the last
question, the last and most important question, he couldn't make
the words come out. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden
to a rationalist, for all that he'd ever recited the Litany of
Tarski or the Litany of Gendlin or sworn that whatever could be
destroyed by the truth should be, in that one moment, he could not
bring himself to say his last question out loud. Even though he
knew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew he was supposed
to be better than this, he still couldn't say it.</p>
<p>"Now it is my turn to inquire of you." Professor Quirrell's back
straightened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall
of painted concrete. "I was wondering, Mr. Potter, if you had
anything to say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual
endeavor. I am given to understand that an apology, in such cases,
is considered a sign of respect. But you have not offered me one.
Is it just that you have not yet gotten around to it, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it
would slice all the way through you before you realized you were
being murdered.</p>
<p>And Harry just looked at the Defense Professor with cool eyes
that would never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was
no longer in Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that
was fearless; and the solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to
meet the stress, turning smoothly from one facet to another, from
light to darkness, warm to cold.</p>
<p><i>A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put me
in a position where I must submit?</i></p>
<p><i>Genuine emotion on his part?</i></p>
<p>"I see," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose that answers -"</p>
<p>"No," said the boy in a cool, collected voice, "you do not get
to frame the conversation that easily, Professor. I went to
considerable lengths to protect you and get you out of Azkaban
safely, <i>after</i> I thought you had tried to kill a police
officer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a
Patronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when you demanded it,
would you have said thank-you in turn? Or am I correct in thinking
that it was my submission you demanded there, and not only my
respect?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell's voice came in
reply, openly icy with danger no longer veiled. "It seems you still
cannot bring yourself to lose, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>Darkness stared out of Harry's eyes without flinching, the
Defense Professor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them.
"Oh, and are <i>you</i> pondering now, whether <i>you</i> should
pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before my own
anger, in order to preserve your own plans? Did the thought of a
calculated false apology even <i>cross your mind?</i> Me neither,
Professor Quirrell."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor laughed, low and humorless, emptier than
the void between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with
hard radiation. "No, Mr. Potter, you have not learned your lesson,
not at all."</p>
<p>"I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban," said the boy, his
voice level. "That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over
to the Aurors. Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I
heard your voice saying it to me, in my mind; and I would have
<i>done</i> it, if I had been there by myself. But I could not
bring myself to lose <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defense
Professor could not quite think of what to say to that.</p>
<p>"I am curious," said Professor Quirrell at last. "What do you
think that I should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit
instructions in the event of a fight. You were to stay down, stay
out of the way, cast no magic. You violated those instructions and
brought down the mission."</p>
<p>"I made no decision," the boy said evenly, "there was no choice
in it, only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus
was there. For that wish to have never occurred, you should have
warned me that you might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I
assume that if you point your wand at someone and say Avada
Kedavra, it is because you want them dead. Shouldn't that be the
first rule of Unforgivable Curse Safety?"</p>
<p>"Rules are for duels," said the Defense Professor. Some of the
coldness had returned to his voice. "And dueling is a sport, not a
branch of Battle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be
blocked and <i>must</i> be dodged is an indispensable tactic. I
would have thought this obvious to you, but it seems I misjudged
your intellect."</p>
<p>"It also seems to me imprudent," said the boy, continuing as
though the other had not spoken, "to not <i>tell me</i> that my
casting any spell on you might kill us both. What if you had
suffered some mishap, and I had tried an Innervate, or a Hover
Charm? That ignorance, which you permitted for purposes I cannot
guess, played also some part in this catastrophe."</p>
<p>There was another silence. The Defense Professor's eyes had
narrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as
though he had encountered some completely unfamiliar situation; and
still the man spoke no word.</p>
<p>"Well," said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defense
Professor's. "I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do
not think the situation calls for me to submit to you. I never
really did understand the concept of apology, still less as it
applies to a situation like this; if you have my regrets, but not
my submission, does that count as saying sorry?"</p>
<p>Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the
stars.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't know," said the Defense Professor, "I, too, never
understood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile
between us, it seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us
speak no more of it, then. Debts will be settled between us in
time."</p>
<p>There was silence for a time.</p>
<p>"By the way," said the boy. "Hermione Granger would never have
built Azkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she'd
die before she hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you
said before that all wizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and
that's just false as a point of simple fact. Would've realized it
earlier if I hadn't been," the boy gave a brief grim smile,
"stressed out."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor's eyes were half-lidded, his expression
distant. "People's insides are not always like their outsides, Mr.
Potter. Perhaps she simply wishes others to think of her as a good
girl. She cannot use the Patronus Charm -"</p>
<p>"Hah," said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. "She's
having trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There's enough
light in her to destroy Dementors, I'm sure. She wouldn't be able
to <i>stop</i> herself from destroying Dementors, even at the cost
of her own life..." The boy trailed off, and then his voice
resumed. "<i>I</i> might not be such a good person, maybe; but they
do exist, and she's one of them."</p>
<p>Dryly. "She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her
little."</p>
<p>There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, "Professor, I have
to ask, when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn't it ever
occur to you to try and <i>improve</i> it somehow? Like, yes,
something goes terribly wrong in people's heads that makes them
think it's great to torture criminals, but that doesn't mean
they're truly evil inside; and maybe if you taught them the right
things, showed them what they were doing wrong, you could change
-"</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of
before. "Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you
are. Sooner you could change the color of the sky." Another
chuckle, this one colder. "And the reason it is easy for you to
forgive such fools and think well of them, Mr. Potter, is that you
yourself have not been sorely hurt. You will think less fondly of
commonplace idiots after the first time their folly costs you
something dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from your own pocket,
perhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred strangers."
The Defense Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocket-watch
out of his robes, looked at it. "Let us depart now, if there is
nothing more to say between us."</p>
<p>"You don't have any questions about the impossible things I did
to get us out of Azkaban?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Defense Professor. "I believe I have solved most
of them already. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a
person whom I cannot see through immediately, be they friend or
foe. I shall unravel the puzzles about you for myself, in due
time."</p>
<p>The Defense Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the
wall with both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too
slowly. The boy, less gracefully, did the same.</p>
<p>And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he
had earlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would
make it real, and as though it were not, already, vastly
obvious.</p>
<p>"Why am I not like the other children my own age?"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>In a deserted side-road of Diagon Alley, where scraps of
un-Vanished trash could be seen lodged into the edges of the brick
street and the blank brick building-sides that surrounded it, along
with scattered dirt and other signs of neglect, an ancient wizard
and his phoenix Apparated into existence.</p>
<p>The wizard was already reaching within his robes for his
hourglass when, in habit, his eyes jumped to a random spot between
the road and the wall, to memorize it -</p>
<p>And the old wizard blinked in surprise; there was a scrap of
parchment in that spot.</p>
<p>A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore's face as he took a step
forward and took the crumpled scrap, unfolding it.</p>
<p>On it was the single word "NO", and nothing more.</p>
<p>Slowly the wizard let it flutter from his fingers. Absently he
reached down to the pavement, and picked up the nearest scrap of
parchment, which looked remarkably similar to the one he had just
taken; he touched it with his wand, and a moment later it was
inscribed with the same word "NO", in the same handwriting, which
was his own.</p>
<p>The old wizard had planned to go back three hours to when Harry
Potter first arrived in Diagon Alley. He had already watched, upon
his instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be
undone (his one attempt to fool his own instruments, and so control
Time without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in
sufficient disaster to convince him to never again try such
trickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy at the first possible
moment after his arrival, and take him to another safe location, if
not Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy's return).
But now -</p>
<p>"A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in
Diagon Alley?" murmured the old wizard to himself. "Perhaps they
did not set in motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they
had confirmed his arrival here... or else... perhaps..."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures
facing off across from each other. One entity who wore the shape of
a man in his late thirties and already balding, and another mind
that wore the form of an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his
forehead. Ice and shadow, pale blue light.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said the man.</p>
<p>The boy just looked at him. And then said, "Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"Truly," said the man. "I know nothing, and of my guesses I will
not speak. Yet I will say this much -"</p>

11</h3>
<p>Through green flame they whirled, through the Floo network they
spun, Minerva's heart racing with a pounding horror that she hadn't
felt in ten years and three months, the corridors between space
coughed and spit them out into the lobby of Gringotts (the safest
Floo receiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most difficult to
intercept, the fastest way out of Hogwarts without a phoenix). A
goblin attendant turned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a
slightly respectful bow -</p>
<p><i>Determination, Destination, Deliberation!</i></p>
<p>And the two of them were in the alley just in back of Mary's
Place, wands already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back
and the words of an Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising to
Severus's lips.</p>
<p>The alley was empty.</p>
<p>When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already
cracking down on his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as
his lips chanted words of invisibility; he took on the colors of
his surroundings, became a blur of his surroundings, the blur moved
and matched what was behind him and then there was nothing
there.</p>
<p>She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her own
Disillusionment -</p>
<p>From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame.</p>
<p>She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn and
raised in his right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the
half-circles of his glasses, and Fawkes upon his shoulder had
spread his fire-colored wings in readiness for flight and
fight.</p>
<p>"Albus!" she said. "I thought -" She'd just seen him depart for
Azkaban, and she'd thought not even phoenixes could return from
there so easily.</p>
<p>Then she realized.</p>
<p>"She escaped," said Albus. "Did your Patronus reach him?"</p>
<p>The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins
solidified. "He said he was here, in the washroom -"</p>
<p>"Let us hope he spoke true," said Albus, the wand tapped her
head with a sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment
later the four of them (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible,
though sometimes you saw a flicker of something like fire in his
air) were racing to the front of the restaurant. They paused before
the door while Albus whispered something, and a moment later one of
the customers visible through the windows stood up with a vague
look on his face and opened the door as though taking a quick look
outside for some friend; and the three of them were through, racing
past the unwitting customers (Severus was marking their faces,
Minerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned) toward the
sign that pointed to the washroom -</p>
<p>An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open
with a slam, and four invisible rescuers stormed through it.</p>
<p>The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of
water showed in the sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a
sheet of paper left on the closed lid of the toilet.</p>
<p>She couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a
moment later was thrust in her own direction.</p>
<p><i>M: What did the hat tell me to tell you?</i></p>
<p><i>- H</i></p>
<p>"Ah," Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment
to place the question, it wasn't the sort of thing you'd forget but
she hadn't been thinking in that <i>mode,</i> really - "I'm an
impudent youngster and I should get off its lawn."</p>
<p>"<i>Eh?</i>" said the air in Albus's voice, as if even he could
be shocked.</p>
<p>And then Harry Potter's head appeared, suspended next to the air
beside the toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry
she'd seen sometimes, eyes darting back and forth and around.</p>
<p>"What's going on -" the boy began.</p>
<p>Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was
moving forward in an instant, his left hand reached forward and
plucked a hair from Harry's head (producing a startled yelp from
the boy), Minerva accepted the hair in her own hand, and a moment
later Albus swept up the mostly-invisible boy in his arms and there
was a flash of red-golden fire.</p>
<p>And Harry Potter was safe.</p>
<p>Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where
Albus and Harry had been, trying to recover her poise.</p>
<p>She'd... lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of
the Phoenix had disbanded.</p>
<p>Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand
was already drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand
already stretching forth in demand. She gave him Harry's hair, and
a moment later, it dropped into the flask of unfinished Polyjuice,
which at once began fizzing and bubbling as it settled into the
potency that would enable Severus to act his part as bait.</p>
<p>"That was unexpected," the Potions Master said slowly. "Why did
our Headmaster not retrieve Mr. Potter <i>earlier</i>, I wonder, if
he was going so far as to twist Time? There should have been
nothing preventing him from doing so... indeed, your Patronus
should have found Mr. Potter already safe..."</p>
<p>She hadn't thought of that, a different realization having
jumped to the forefront of her mind. It wasn't nearly as horrifying
as Bellatrix Black having escaped from Azkaban, but still -</p>
<p>"Harry has an <i>invisibility cloak?</i>" she said.</p>
<p>The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-ting-</p>
<p>It still annoyed her, though it faded past attention after a
while; and when and if she became Headmistress, she intended to
Silence the whole lot. Which Head of Hogwarts, she wondered, had
first been so inconsiderate as to create a device that made
<i>noise</i>, to pass on to their successors?</p>
<p>She was sitting in the Headmaster's office with a quickly
Transfigured desk of her own, doing some of the hundred little
pieces of necessary paperwork that kept Hogwarts from grinding to a
halt; she could lose herself in it easily, and it prevented her
from thinking about other things. Albus had once remarked, sounding
rather wry, that Hogwarts seemed to run even more smoothly when
there was an outside crisis for her to avoid thinking about...</p>
<p>...ten years ago, that was the last time Albus had said
that.</p>
<p>There was the chime that indicated an approaching visitor.</p>
<p>Minerva kept reading her current parchment.</p>
<p>The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, who took three
steps inward and demanded without the slightest pause, "Any word
from Mad-Eye?"</p>
<p>Albus was already rising from his chair, even as she tucked away
her parchments and dispelled the desk. "Moody's Patronus is
reporting to the me in Azkaban," Albus said. "His Eye saw nothing;
and if the Eye of Vance does not see a thing, then that thing does
not exist. Yourself?"</p>
<p>"No one has tried to forcibly take my blood," Severus said. He
gave a quick grimace of a smile. "Except the Defense
Professor."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Minerva.</p>
<p>"He saw me for an impostor before I could even open my lips, and
quite reasonably attacked me on the spot, demanding to know the
whereabouts of Mr. Potter." Another grimace of a smile. "Shouting
that I was Severus Snape did not seem to reassure him, for some
reason. I do believe that man would kill me for a Sickle and give
back five Knuts change. I had to stun our good Professor Quirrell,
which was not easy, and then he reacted poorly to the hex. 'Harry
Potter', naturally alarmed, ran out and told the owner, and the
Defense Professor was taken to St. Mungos -"</p>
<p>"<i>St. Mungos?</i>"</p>
<p>"- which said he had probably been overworking himself for weeks
before he collapsed, such was his state of exhaustion. Your
precious Defense Professor is fine, Minerva, the stunner may have
helped him by forcing him to take a few days off. Afterward I
declined the offer of a Floo to Hogwarts, and went back to Diagon
Alley and wandered; but no one seems to have wanted Mr. Potter's
blood today."</p>
<p>"Our Defense Professor is in the best of hands, I am sure," said
Albus. "Greater matters command our attention, Minerva."</p>
<p>It took considerable effort for her to wrench her attention
back, but she sat back down, and Severus gestured up a chair for
himself as well, and the three of them drew together to begin their
council.</p>
<p>She felt like a Polyjuiced impostor, sitting with those two. War
was not her art, nor plotting. She had to strain to keep one step
ahead of the Weasley twins, and sometimes she failed at that. She
was sitting here, ultimately, only because she had heard the
prophecy...</p>
<p>"We are faced," the Headmaster spoke first, "with a rather
alarming mystery. I can think of only two wizards who might have
engineered this escape."</p>
<p>Minerva drew in her breath sharply. "There is a chance it is
<i>not</i> You-Know-Who?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so," said the Headmaster.</p>
<p>She glanced to her side and saw that Severus looked as puzzled
as herself. <i>Afraid</i> the Dark Lord was not rising again? She
would have given almost anything for that to be true.</p>
<p>"So," Albus said heavily. "Our first suspect is Voldemort, risen
again and seeking to resurrect himself. I have studied many books I
wish I had not read, seeking his every possible avenue of return,
and I have found only three. His strongest road to life is the
Philosopher's Stone, which Flamel assures me that not even
Voldemort could create on his own; by that road he would rise
greater and more terrible than ever before. I would not have
thought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of the Stone, still
less because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. But
his second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant,
willingly given; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone
of his ancestor, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a
perfectionist -" Albus glanced at Severus, who nodded agreement, "-
and he would certainly seek the most powerful combination: the
flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood of Harry Potter, and the bone
of his father. Voldemort's final avenue is to seduce a victim and
drain the life from them over a long period; in which case
Voldemort would be weak compared to his former power. His motive to
spirit away Bellatrix is clear. And if he is keeping her in
reserve, to use only in case he cannot attain the Stone, that would
explain why no kidnap attempt was made on Harry this day."</p>
<p>Minerva glanced again at Severus, saw him listening attentively
but without surprise.</p>
<p>"What is <i>not</i> clear," the Headmaster continued, "is
<i>how</i> Voldemort could have engineered this escape. A death
doll was left in Bellatrix's place, her escape was meant to be
undetected; and even though that went wrong, the Dementors could
not find her after their first warning. Azkaban has stood
impenetrable for centuries, and I cannot imagine any means by which
Voldemort could have accomplished this."</p>
<p>"That may mean little," Severus said, expressionless. "For the
Dark Lord to do what we cannot imagine requires only that he has a
better imagination."</p>
<p>Albus nodded grimly. "Unfortunately there is now another wizard
who laughs at impossibilities. A wizard who, not long ago,
developed a new and powerful Charm which could have blinded the
Dementors to Bellatrix Black's escape. And he is implicated for
other reasons, as well."</p>
<p>Minerva's heart was skipping beats, she didn't know <i>how,</i>
or <i>why,</i> but a terrible apprehension was dawning on her as to
<i>who -</i></p>
<p>"Who would <i>that</i> be?" said Severus, sounding puzzled.</p>
<p>Albus leaned back and said the fatal words, even as she had
feared them: "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres."</p>
<p>"<i>Potter?</i>" demanded the Potions Master, as much shock in
that usually-silken voice as she had ever heard from him.
"Headmaster, is this one of your jokes? He is in his first year at
Hogwarts! A temper tantrum and a few childish pranks with an
invisibility cloak does not make him -"</p>
<p>"It is no joke," said Minerva, her voice barely above a whisper.
"Harry is already making original discoveries in Transfiguration,
Severus. Though I did not know he was researching Charms as
well."</p>
<p>"Harry is no ordinary first-year," the Headmaster said solemnly.
"He is marked as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark
Lord knows not."</p>
<p>Severus was looking at her, and you would have needed to know
him well to recognize that his glance was pleading. "Am I to take
this seriously?"</p>
<p>Minerva simply nodded.</p>
<p>"Does anyone <i>else</i> know of this... new and powerful
Charm?" Severus demanded.</p>
<p>The Headmaster glanced at her apologetically -</p>
<p>Somehow she knew, she knew before he even said it, and she
wanted to scream at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>- and said, "Quirinus Quirrell."</p>
<p>"<i>Why,</i>" she said, in a voice that should have melted half
the devices in the office, "<i>did Mr. Potter even TELL our Defense
Professor about his brilliant new Charm for breaking out of prisons
-</i>"</p>
<p>The Headmaster passed a weary wrinkled hand across his equally
wrinkled forehead. "Quirinus just happened to be there, Minerva.
Even I saw no harm in it at the time." The Headmaster hesitated.
"And Harry said his Charm was too dangerous to be explained to
either of us; and when I asked him again, this day, he insisted he
had still not explained it to Quirinus, nor had he ever dropped his
Occlumency barriers in the Defense Professor's presence -"</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter is an <i>Occlumens?</i> You gave him an invisibility
cloak and he is immune to Veritaserum <i>and he is friends with the
Weasley twins?</i> Albus, do you have any idea what you have
unleashed upon this school?" Her voice was nearly shrieking, now.
"By his seventh year there won't be anything left of Hogwarts but a
smoking hole in the ground!"</p>
<p>Albus leaned back in his great cushioned chair, and said,
smiling, "Don't forget the Time-Turner."</p>
<p>She did scream then, but quietly.</p>
<p>Severus drawled, "Should I teach him to brew Polyjuice,
Headmaster? I ask only for the sake of completeness, in case you
are not satisfied with the magnitude of your pet disaster."</p>
<p>"Perhaps next year," said Albus. "My dearest friends, the
question before us is whether Harry Potter has spirited Bellatrix
Black out of Azkaban, which is more than youthful high spirits even
by my tolerant standards."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Headmaster," Severus said with one of the dryer
smiles she had ever seen him deliver to Albus, "but I will register
my opinion that the answer is no. This is the Dark Lord's work,
pure and simple."</p>
<p>"Then why," Albus said, and now there was no humor at all in his
voice, "when I planned to retrieve Harry immediately after his
arrival in Diagon Alley, did I find that this would result in
paradox?"</p>
<p>Minerva sank further back into her chair, dropped her left elbow
onto the hard uncushioned armrest, leaned her head into her hand,
and shut her eyes in despair.</p>
<p>There was a narrowly circulated proverb to the effect that only
one Auror in thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving
Time-Turners; and that of those few, the half who weren't
<i>already</i> insane, soon would be.</p>
<p>"So you suspect," Severus's voice was saying, "that Potter went
from Diagon Alley to Azkaban, then looped back to Diagon Alley
afterward to be picked up by us -"</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Albus's voice. "Though it is also possible
that Voldemort or his servants watched to make sure Harry did
arrive in Diagon Alley, before they began their attempt on Azkaban.
And that they had someone with a Time-Turner who would send back
the message of their success, to trigger the abduction. Indeed, it
was my suspicion of this possibility that caused me to dispatch you
and Minerva on your own mission, before I myself went to Azkaban. I
thought then that their breakout would fail, but if retrieving
Harry Potter meant observing the fact of their eventual failure,
then I myself could not have gone to Azkaban after I had interacted
with him, for Azkaban's future cannot touch its past. When, in
Azkaban, I received no report from you or Minerva, nor from
Flitwick whom I told to try contacting you, I knew that your
interaction with Harry Potter had been an interaction with
Azkaban's future, meaning that someone was sending messages through
Time -"</p>
<p>Then Albus's voice stopped.</p>
<p>"But Headmaster," said Severus, "<i>you</i> came back from
Azkaban's future and interacted with us..."</p>
<p>The Potions Master's voice trailed off.</p>
<p>"But Severus, if I had <i>received</i> reports from you and
Minerva of Harry's safety, I would not, in the first place, have
gone backward in time to -"</p>
<p>"Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this."</p>
<p>"I agree, Severus."</p>
<p>There was the sound of parchment being spread on a table, and
then quills scratching, and more arguing.</p>
<p>Minerva sat in her chair, head resting in her hand, eyes
shut.</p>
<p>There was a story she'd once heard about a criminal who had
possessed a Time-Turner which the Department of Mysteries had
sealed to him, in a case of extremely bad judgment as to who needed
one; and there had been an Auror assigned to track down this
unknown time-criminal, who had also been given a Time-Turner; and
the story ended with both of them in St. Mungo's ward for Total
Unrecoverable Nutcases.</p>
<p>Minerva sat there with her eyes shut, trying not to listen,
trying not to think about it, and trying not to go insane.</p>
<p>After awhile, when the argument seemed to have wound down, she
said aloud, "Mr. Potter's Time-Turner is restricted to the hours of
nine PM through midnight. Was the shell tampered with, Albus?"</p>
<p>"Not to my most discerning Charms," said Albus. "But the shells
are new things; and to defeat the Unspeakables' precautions and
leave no trace of the defeat... might <i>not</i> be
impossible."</p>
<p>She opened her eyes, and saw Severus and the Headmaster staring
intently at a parchment covered with tangled squiggles that would
have no doubt driven her mad to comprehend.</p>
<p>"Have you come to any <i>conclusions?</i>" Minerva said. "And
please don't tell me how you arrived at them."</p>
<p>Severus and the Headmaster looked at each other, then turned to
look at her.</p>
<p>"We have concluded," the Headmaster said gravely, "that either
Harry was involved or he was not; that either Voldemort has access
to a Time-Turner or he does not; and that regardless of what could
have happened within Azkaban, nobody would have visited the Little
Hangleton graveyard during the period Moody has already watched
over it within my own past."</p>
<p>"In short," Severus drawled, "we know nothing, dear Minerva;
though it seems at least <i>likely</i> that another Time-Turner was
involved, somehow. My own suspicion is that Potter has been bribed,
tricked, or threatened into conveying messages backward in time,
perhaps even regarding this very prison break. I shall not make the
obvious suggestion as to who is pulling his strings. But I suggest
that at nine o' clock tonight, we test whether Potter is able to
travel the full six hours backward to three o' clock, to see if he
has yet used his Time-Turner."</p>
<p>"That seems wise to do in any case," said Dumbledore. "See that
done, Minerva, and tell Harry to stop in my office at his
convenience, afterward."</p>
<p>"But you still suspect Harry of direct involvement in the prison
break itself?" Minerva said.</p>
<p>"Possible but unlikely," said Severus, at the same time Albus
said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Minerva pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, let
it out. "Albus, Severus, what possible <i>reason</i> has Mr. Potter
to do such a thing!"</p>
<p>"None that I can think of," said Albus, "but it remains that
Harry's magics alone, of all the means known to me, might have
-"</p>
<p>"Hold," said Severus. All expression vanished from his face. "A
thought occurs to me, I must check -" The Potions Master seized a
pinch of Floo powder, strode across the room toward the fireplace -
Albus hastily waved his wand to light it - and then in a flare of
green flame, and the words "Slytherin Head of House office",
Severus was gone.</p>
<p>She and Albus looked at each other and both shrugged; and then
Albus turned back to studying the parchment.</p>
<p>It was only a few minutes later that Severus spun back out of
the Floo, brushing traces of ash from himself.</p>
<p>"Well," said the Potions Master. Again the expressionless face.
"I am afraid that Mr. Potter does have a motive."</p>
<p>"Speak!" said Albus.</p>
<p>"I found Lesath Lestrange in the Slytherin common room,
studying," Severus said. "He was not reluctant to meet my eyes. And
it seems that Mr. Lestrange did not like to think of his parents in
Azkaban, in the cold and the darkness, with the Dementors sucking
away their life, hurting every second of every day, and he told Mr.
Potter so in as many words, and begged him to get them out. Since,
you see, Mr. Lestrange had heard that the Boy-Who-Lived could do
anything."</p>
<p>She and Albus exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"Severus," Minerva said, "<i>surely...</i> even <i>Harry</i>...
has more common sense than <i>that...</i>"</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter thinks he is God," Severus said without expression,
"and Lesath Lestrange fell to his knees before him in a heartfelt
cry of prayer."</p>
<p>Minerva stared at Severus, feeling sick to her stomach. She had
studied Muggle religion - it was the most common reason for needing
to Memory-Charm the parents of Muggleborns - and she knew enough to
understand what Severus had just said.</p>
<p>"In any case," said the Potions Master. "I looked within Mr.
Lestrange to see if he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has
heard nothing. But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the
person responsible was Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That is good
news."</p>
<p>"<i>Good news?</i>" Minerva burst out.</p>
<p>Albus looked at her, his face as expressionless as Severus's,
now; and she remembered, with a shock, that Albus's own - "It is
the best reason I can possibly imagine for removing Bellatrix from
Azkaban," Albus said quietly. "And if it is <i>not</i> Harry, let
us recall, then it is certainly Voldemort himself making his first
moves. But let us not be hasty in judgment while there is much we
do not yet know, but soon will."</p>
<p>Albus once more stood up from behind his desk, strode to the
fireplace still alight, cast in another pinch of green powder, and
stuck his head into the flames. "Department of Magical Law
Enforcement," he said, "Director's office."</p>
<p>After a moment, the voice of Madam Bones came through clear and
sharp, "What is it, Albus? I am somewhat busy."</p>
<p>"Amelia," said Albus, "I beg of you to share any discoveries you
have made concerning this matter."</p>
<p>There was a pause. "Oh," said the cold voice of Madam Bones from
the blazing fire, "and is that a two-way road then, Albus?"</p>
<p>"It may be," the old wizard said calmly.</p>
<p>"If any Auror dies of your reticence, old meddler, I will hold
you responsible in full measure."</p>
<p>"I understand, Amelia," Albus said, "but I have no wish to spark
needless alarm and incredulity -"</p>
<p>"<i>Bellatrix Black</i> has escaped from <i>Azkaban!</i> What
alarm or incredulity do you think I will call <i>needless,</i> in
the face of that?"</p>
<p>"I may call on you to remember those words," said the old wizard
into the green flames. "For if I learn that my fears are not
needless, I <i>will</i> tell you. Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you
have learned anything whatsoever upon this matter, please share
it."</p>
<p>There was another pause, and then Madam Bones's voice said, "I
have information which I learned four hours into the future, Albus.
Do you still want it?"</p>
<p>Albus paused -</p>
<p>(weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to
go back more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn't
send information further back in time than six hours, not through
any chain of Time-Turners)</p>
<p>- and finally said, "Yes, please."</p>
<p>"We had a lucky break," said Madam Bones's voice, "one of the
Aurors who witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us
that the Flying-Fire spell, as we were calling it, might be no
spell at all, but a Muggle artifact."</p>
<p>Like a punch in the stomach, that was how it felt, and the
sickness in Minerva's belly redoubled. Anyone who'd watched a Chaos
Legion battle knew whose hand that showed...</p>
<p>Madam Bones's voice continued. "We brought in Arthur Weasley
from Misuse of Muggle Artifacts - he knows more about Muggle
artifacts than any wizard alive - and gave him the descriptions
from the Aurors on the scene, and he cracked it. It was a Muggle
artifact called a rocker, and they call it that because you'd have
to be off your rocker to ride one. Just six years ago one of their
rockers blew up, killed hundreds of Muggles in a flash and almost
set fire to the Moon. Weasley says that rockers use a special kind
of science called opposite reaction, so the plan is to develop a
jinx which will prevent that science from working around
Azkaban."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Amelia," Albus said gravely. "Is that
everything?"</p>
<p>"I'll check if we have anything from six hours forward," said
the voice of Madam Bones, "if so they wouldn't have told me, but
I'll have them tell you. Do <i>you</i> have anything you want to
tell me, Albus? Which of those two possibilities is it looking
like?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, Amelia," Albus said, "but I may have word for you
soon."</p>
<p>He straightened up from the fire, then, which faded back to
ordinary yellow flames. Every minute of the old wizard's years,
every natural second since his birth and every second which
Time-Turning had added, all of that plus a few extra decades for
stress, was visible on his lined face.</p>
<p>"Severus?" the old wizard said. "What was it actually?"</p>
<p>"A rocket," said the half-blood Potions Master, who had grown up
in the Muggle town of Spinner's End. "One of the most impressive
Muggle technologies."</p>
<p>"How likely is <i>Harry</i> to know such arts?" said
Minerva.</p>
<p>Severus drawled, "Oh, a boy like Mr. Potter knows <i>all</i>
about rockets; that, dear Minerva, is a certainty. You must
remember that things are done differently in the Muggle world."
Severus frowned. "But rockets <i>are</i> dangerous, and
expensive..."</p>
<p>"Harry has stolen and hidden an unknown amount of money from his
Gringotts vault, perhaps thousands of Galleons," said the
Headmaster, and then, to their twin stares, "That was <i>not</i> in
my plan, but I made the mistake of sending the Defense Professor to
supervise Harry's withdrawal of five Galleons for Christmas
presents..." The Headmaster shrugged. "Yes, I agree, sheer folly in
retrospect, let us continue."</p>
<p>Minerva quietly thudded her head a few times against the
headrest of her chair.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless, Headmaster," Severus said. "Just because the Death
Eaters never used Muggle artifacts in the first war, that does not
mean <i>he</i> is ignorant. Rockets fell on Britain as weapons, in
the Muggle side of Grindelwald's war. If he spent the summers of
those years in a Muggle orphanage, as you told us, Headmaster...
then he, too, has heard of rockets. And if he has been listening to
reports of Mr. Potter and his mock battles using Muggle artifacts,
he would certainly learn his enemy's strengths and try to redouble
them himself. That is <i>just</i> how he thinks; any power he sees
he will try to take for his own."</p>
<p>The old wizard was standing stock still, utterly motionless,
even the hairs of his beard frozen in place like solid wires; and
the thought came to Minerva, as frightening as any thought she'd
ever had, that Albus Dumbledore was rooted to the spot in
horror.</p>
<p>"Severus," Albus Dumbledore said, and his voice almost cracked,
"do you realize what you are saying? If Harry Potter and Voldemort
fight their war with Muggle weapons there will be nothing left of
the world but fire!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Minerva. She had heard of guns, of course,
but they weren't <i>that</i> dangerous to an experienced witch
-</p>
<p>Severus spoke as though she weren't in the room. "Then perhaps,
Headmaster, he is sending a deliberate warning to Harry Potter of
exactly that; saying that any attack with Muggle weapons will be
met with retaliation in kind. Command Mr. Potter to cease his use
of Muggle technology in his battles; that will show him the message
is received... and not give him any more ideas." Severus frowned.
"Though, come to think of it, Mr. Malfoy - and of course Miss
Granger - well, on second thought a blanket prohibition on
technology seems wiser -"</p>
<p>The old wizard pressed both his hands to his forehead, and from
his lips came an unsteady voice, "I begin to <i>hope</i> that it is
Harry behind this escape... oh, Merlin defend us all, what have I
done, what have I done, what will become of the world?"</p>
<p>Severus shrugged. "From the rumors I have heard, Headmaster,
Muggle weapons are only slightly worse than the more...
<i>recondite</i> aspects of wizardry -"</p>
<p>"<i>Worse?</i>" gasped Minerva, and then shut her mouth as
though by force.</p>
<p>"Worse than any peril left in these fading years," said Albus.
"Not worse than that which erased Atlantis from Time."</p>
<p>Minerva stared at him, feeling the sweat break out all along her
spine.</p>
<p>Severus continued, still addressing Albus. "All the Death Eaters
save Bellatrix would have betrayed him, all his supporters turned
against him, all the powers of the world converged to destroy him,
if he had been reckless with any truly dangerous potency. Is this
so different, then?"</p>
<p>Some motion, some color, had returned to the old wizard's face.
"Perhaps not..."</p>
<p>"And in any case," Severus said with a slightly condescending
smile, "Muggle weapons are not so easy to obtain, not for a
thousand Galleons or a thousand thousand."</p>
<p><i>Doesn't Harry just Transfigure the devices he uses in his
battles?</i> thought Minerva, but before she could open her mouth
to ask -</p>
<p>The fireplace erupted in green flames, then, and the face of
Pius Thicknesse, Madam Bones's assistant, appeared therein. "Chief
Warlock?" said Thicknesse. "I have a report for you, transmitted
from -" Thicknesse's eyes flickered over Minerva and Severus, "six
minutes ago."</p>
<p>"Six hours ahead, you mean," said Albus. "These two are meant to
hear it; deliver your report."</p>
<p>"We know how it was done," said Thicknesse. "In Bellatrix
Black's cell, hidden in one corner, was a potions vial; and testing
the traces of remaining fluid shows that it was an Animagus
potion."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>"I see..." Albus said heavily.</p>
<p>"Pardon me?" said Minerva. She didn't.</p>
<p>Thicknesse's head turned toward her. "Animagi, Madam McGonagall,
in their Animagus forms, are of less interest to Dementors. All
prisoners are tested before their arrival at Azkaban; and if they
are Animagi, their Animagus form is destroyed. But we had not
considered that someone protected by a Patronus Charm while taking
the potion and performing the meditation, might be able to become
an Animagus <i>after</i> they went to Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"I understood," Severus said, having by now put on his customary
sneer, "that the Animagus meditation required considerable
time."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Snape," Thicknesse barked, "records show that
Bellatrix Black was an Animagus <i>before</i> she was sentenced to
Azkaban and her form destroyed; so maybe her <i>second</i>
meditation didn't take as much time as her first!"</p>
<p>"I would not have thought it possible for any prisoner of
Azkaban to do such a thing..." Albus said. "But Bellatrix Black was
a most powerful sorceress before her incarceration, and she might
have done it if any witch could. Can Azkaban be secured against
this method?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the confident head of Pius Thicknesse. "Our expert
says that it is nigh-unimaginable that an Animagus meditation could
be performed in less than three hours, regardless of experience.
All visits to prisoners allowed to receive them will be limited to
two hours henceforth, and the Dementors will inform us if any
Patronus Charm is maintained in the prison areas for longer than
that."</p>
<p>Albus looked unhappy at that, but nodded. "I see. There will be
no further attempts of that sort, of course, but do not relax your
vigilance. And when Amelia has been told all this, tell her that I
have information for her."</p>
<p>The head of Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.</p>
<p>"No further attempts...?" said Minerva.</p>
<p>"Because, dear Minerva," Severus drawled, having not quite taken
off his habitual sneer, "if the Dark Lord had planned to free any
of his other servants from Azkaban, he would not have left behind
the vial of potion to tell us how it was done." Severus frowned. "I
confess... even so I do not see why that vial was left there."</p>
<p>"It is some kind of message..." Albus said slowly. "And I cannot
see what it means, not at all..." He drummed his fingers on his
desk.</p>
<p>For a long minute or three, the old wizard stared off into
nothingness, frowning; while Severus also sat in silence.</p>
<p>Then Albus shook his head in dismay, and said, "Severus, do
<i>you</i> comprehend this?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Potions Master, and with a sardonic smile, "which
is probably all the better for us; whatever we are <i>intended</i>
to conclude from it, that part of his plan has misfired."</p>
<p>"You are certain, now, that it <i>is</i> You-Know... that it is
Voldemort?" said Minerva. "It could not be that some other Death
Eater conceived this clever notion?"</p>
<p>"And they knew about rockets, too?" Severus said dryly. "I don't
believe the other Death Eaters were so fond of Muggle Studies. It
is he."</p>
<p>"Aye, it is he," Albus said. "Azkaban has endured impenetrable
for ages, only to fall to an ordinary Animagus potion. It is too
clever and too impossible, which was ever Voldemort's signature
since the days he was known as Tom Riddle. Anyone who wished to
forge that signature must needs be as cunning as Voldemort himself
to do so. And there is no one else in the world who would
accidentally overestimate my wit, and leave me a message I cannot
understand at all."</p>
<p>"Unless he has gauged you exactly," Severus said tonelessly, "in
which case all that is just what he intended you to think."</p>
<p>Albus sighed. "Indeed. But even if he has tricked me perfectly,
we may at least rely on the conclusion that it was not Harry
Potter."</p>
<p>It should have come as a relief, and yet Minerva felt the chill
spreading through her spine and her veins, her lungs and her
bones.</p>
<p>She remembered conversations like this.</p>
<p>She remembered conversations like this from ten years ago, from
a time when blood had run through Britain in wide rivers, when
wizards and witches she had once taught in class had been
slaughtered by the hundreds, she remembered burning homes and
screaming children and flashes of green light -</p>
<p>"What will you tell Madam Bones?" she whispered.</p>
<p>Albus stood from his desk and paced to the center of the room,
his hand lightly touching the devices, here an instrument of light,
there an instrument of sound; he adjusted his glasses with one
hand, used the other to center the long silver beard against his
robes, and then finally that ancient wizard turned back and faced
them.</p>
<p>"I will tell her what little I know of the Dark Art called
horcrux, by which a soul is deprived of death," said Albus
Dumbledore, in a soft voice that seemed to fill the whole room,
"and I will tell her what may be done with the flesh of the
servant."</p>
<p>"I will tell her that I am reconstituting the Order of the
Phoenix."</p>
<p>"I will tell her that Voldemort has returned."</p>
<p>"And that the Second Wizarding War is begun."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Some hours later...</i></p>
<p>The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress's
office had golden hands, and silver numerals to make the
clock-face; it ticked and jerked soundlessly through its motions,
for there was a Quieting enchantment on it.</p>
<p>The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, the
golden minute hand did the same, the two linked components of Time
nearing each other, soon to be in the same place and never to
collide.</p>
<p>It was 8:43 PM, and the time approached when Harry's Time-Turner
would open, to be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell
could fool, unless that spell could bypass the laws of Time itself.
No body or soul, no knowledge or substance, could stretch an extra
seven hours in a single day. She would make up a message on the
spot, and tell Harry to take that message back six hours to
Professor Flitwick at 3PM, and she would ask Professor Flitwick if
he had received it in that hour.</p>
<p>And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed
received it at 3PM.</p>
<p>And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a <i>little</i>
more faith in Harry next time.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her
shining cat, "Go to Mr. Potter, and tell him this: Mr. Potter,
please come to my office as soon as you hear this, without doing
anything else along the way."</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="62">Chapter 62</h2><h3>The Stanford Prison Experiment,
Final</h3>
<p>Minerva gazed up at the clock, the golden hands and silver
numerals, the jerking motion. Muggles had invented that, and until
they had, wizards had not bothered keeping time. Bells, timed by a
sanded hourglass, had served Hogwarts for its classes when it was
built. It was one of the things that blood purists wished not to be
true, and therefore Minerva knew it.</p>
<p>She had received an Outstanding on her Muggle Studies N.E.W.T.,
which now seemed to her a mark of shame, considering how little she
knew. Her younger self had realized, even then, that the class was
a sham, taught by a pureblood, supposedly because Muggleborns could
not appreciate what wizardborns needed to be told, and actually
because the Board of Governors did not approve of Muggles at all.
But when she was seventeen the Outstanding grade had been the main
thing that mattered to her, she was saddened to remember...</p>
<p><i>If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle
weapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire!</i></p>
<p>She couldn't imagine it, and the reason she couldn't imagine it
was that she couldn't imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>She had encountered the Dark Lord four times and survived each
one, three times with Albus to shield her and once with Moody at
her side. She remembered the damaged, snakelike face, the faint
green scales scattered over the skin, the glowing red eyes, the
voice that laughed in a high-pitched hiss and promised nothing but
cruelty and torment: the monster pure and complete.</p>
<p>And Harry Potter was easy to picture in her mind, the bright
expression on the face of a young boy who wavered between taking
the ludicrous seriously and taking the serious ludicrously.</p>
<p>And to think of the two of them facing off at wandpoint was too
painful to be imagined.</p>
<p>They had no right, no right at all to set this on an
eleven-year-old boy. She knew what the Headmaster had decided for
him this day, for she had been told to make the arrangements; and
if it had been her at the same age she would have raged and
screamed and cried and been inconsolable for weeks, and...</p>
<p><i>He is no ordinary first-year,</i> Albus had said. <i>He is
marked as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark Lord
knows not.</i></p>
<p>The terrible hollow voice booming from Sybill Trelawney's
throat, the true and original prophecy, echoed once more through
her mind. She had a feeling it didn't mean what the Headmaster
thought it did, but there was no way to put the difference into
words.</p>
<p>And even so it still seemed true, that if there were any
eleven-year-old within the Earth entire who could bear this burden,
that boy approached her office now. And if she said anything at all
like 'poor Harry' to his face... well, he wouldn't like it.</p>
<p><i>So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark
Wizard,</i> Harry had said on the day he had first learned. <i>I
really wish you had told me that before I started
shopping...</i></p>
<p>She'd been Head of House Gryffindor for long enough, she'd
watched enough friends die, to know that there were some people you
couldn't save from becoming heroes.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door, and Professor McGonagall said,
"Enter."</p>
<p>When Harry entered, his face had the same cold, alert look she'd
seen in Mary's Place; and she wondered for an instant if he'd been
wearing that same mask, that same self, this whole day.</p>
<p>The young boy seated himself on the chair before her desk, and
said, "So is it time for me to be told what's going on?" Neutral
the words, not the sharpness that should have gone with the
expression.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's eyes rose in surprise before she could
stop them, and she said, "The Headmaster told you nothing, Mr.
Potter?"</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. "Only that he'd received a warning that
I might be in danger, but I was safe now."</p>
<p>Minerva was having trouble meeting his gaze. How could they
<i>do</i> this to him, how could they lay this upon an
eleven-year-old boy, this war, this destiny, this prophecy... and
they didn't even <i>trust</i> him...</p>
<p>She forced herself to look at Harry directly, and saw that his
green eyes were calm as they rested on her.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall?" the boy said quietly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I'm afraid it is not
my place to explain, but if after this the Headmaster <i>still</i>
does not tell you anything, you may come back to me and I will go
yell at him for you."</p>
<p>The boy's eyes widened, something of the real Harry showing
through the crack before the cool mask was set back in place.</p>
<p>"In any case," Professor McGonagall said briskly. "I'm sorry for
the inconvenience, Mr. Potter, but I need to ask you to use your
Time-Turner to go back six hours to three o'clock, and give the
following message to Professor Flitwick: Silver on the tree. Ask
the Professor to note down the time at which you gave him that
message. Afterward the Headmaster wishes to meet with you at your
convenience."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Then the boy said, "I am suspected of misusing my Time-Turner,
then?"</p>
<p>"Not by <i>me!</i>" Professor McGonagall said hastily. "I
<i>am</i> sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>There was another pause, and then the young boy shrugged. "It'll
play hob with my sleep schedule but I suppose it can't be helped.
Please let the house elves know that if I ask for an early
breakfast at, say, three A.M. tomorrow morning, I'm to receive
it."</p>
<p>"Of course, Mr. Potter," she said. "Thank you for
understanding."</p>
<p>The boy rose up from his chair and gave her a formal nod, then
slipped out the door with his hand already going under his shirt to
where his Time-Turner waited; and she almost called out
<i>Harry!</i> only she wouldn't have known what to say after.</p>
<p>Instead she waited, her eyes on the clock.</p>
<p>How long did she need to wait for Harry Potter to go back in
time?</p>
<p>She didn't need to wait at all, actually; if he had done it,
then it had already happened...</p>
<p>Minerva knew, then, that she was delaying because she was
nervous, and the realization saddened her. Mischief, yes,
unspeakable unthinkable mischief with all the prudence and
foresight of a falling rock - she didn't know how the boy had
tricked the Hat into not Sorting him to Gryffindor where he
obviously belonged - but nothing dark or harmful, not ever. Beneath
that mischief his goodness ran as deep and as true as the Weasley
twins', though not even the Cruciatus Curse could have gotten her
to say that out loud.</p>
<p>"<i>Expecto Patronum</i>," she said, and then, "Go to Professor
Flitwick, and bear back his reply after you ask him this: 'Did Mr.
Potter give you a message from me, what was that message, and when
did you receive it?'"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>One hour earlier, having used the last remaining spin of his
Time-Turner after putting on the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry
tucked the hourglass back into his shirt.</p>
<p>And he set out toward the Slytherin dungeons, striding as
quickly as his invisible legs could manage, though not running.
Thankfully the Deputy Headmistress's office was already on a lower
floor of Hogwarts...</p>
<p>A few staircases later, taken two steps but not three steps at
once, Harry stopped at a corridor around whose final bend lay the
entrance to the Slytherin dorms.</p>
<p>Harry took a piece of parchment (not paper) out of his parch,
took a Quotes Quill (not pen) out of his pouch, and told the quill,
"Write these letters exactly as I say them: Z-P-G-B-S-Y, space,
F-V-Y-I-R-E-B-A-G-U-R-G-E-R-R."</p>
<p>There were two kinds of codes in cryptography, codes that
stopped your little brother from reading your message and codes
that stopped major governments from reading your message, and this
was the first kind of code, but it was better than nothing. In
theory, no one should read it anyway; but even if they did, they
wouldn't remember anything interesting unless they did cryptography
first.</p>
<p>Harry then put that parchment in a parchment envelope, and with
his wand melted a little green wax to seal it.</p>
<p>In principle, of course, Harry could've done all that hours
earlier, but somehow waiting until <i>after</i> he heard the
message from Professor McGonagall's own lips seemed less like
Messing With Time.</p>
<p>Harry then put that envelope inside another envelope, which
already contained another sheet of paper with other instructions,
and five silver Sickles.</p>
<p>He closed that envelope (which already had a name written on the
outside), sealed it with more green wax, and pressed a final Sickle
into that seal.</p>
<p>Then Harry put <i>that</i> envelope into the very last envelope
on which was written in large letters the name "Merry
Tavington".</p>
<p>And Harry peeked around the bend to where the scowling portrait
that served as the door to the Slytherin dorms waited; and as he
did not wish the portrait to recall not-seeing anyone invisible,
Harry used the Hover Charm to float the envelope to the scowling
man, and tap it against him.</p>
<p>The scowling man looked down at the envelope, peering at it
through a monocle, and sighed, and turned around to face toward the
inside of the Slytherin dorms, and called, "Message for Merry
Tavington!"</p>
<p>The envelope was then allowed to fall to the floor.</p>
<p>A few moments later the portrait door opened, and Merry snatched
up the envelope from the floor.</p>
<p>She would open it up and find a Sickle and an envelope addressed
to a fourth-year student named Margaret Bulstrode.</p>
<p>(Slytherins did this sort of thing all the time, and a Sickle
definitely constituted a rush order.)</p>
<p>Margaret would open <i>her</i> envelope, and find five Sickles
along with an envelope to be dropped off in an unused
classroom...</p>
<p>...<i>after</i> she used her Time-Turner to go back five
hours...</p>
<p>...whereupon she would find another five Sickles waiting for
her, if she got there quickly.</p>
<p>And an invisible Harry Potter would be waiting in that classroom
from three PM to three-thirty, just in case someone tried the
obvious test.</p>
<p>Well, it had been obvious to Professor Quirrell, anyway.</p>
<p>It had also been obvious to Professor Quirrell that (a) Margaret
Bulstrode had a Time-Turner and (b) she wasn't very strict about
how she used it, e.g. telling her younger sister really good pieces
of gossip "before" anyone else had heard.</p>
<p>Some of the tension leaked off Harry as he strode away from the
portrait door, still invisible. Somehow his mind had still managed
to worry about the plan, even <i>knowing</i> that it had already
succeeded. Now there remained only the confrontation with
Dumbledore, and then he was done for the day... he'd go to the
Headmaster's gargoyles at 9PM, since doing it at 8PM would seem
more suspicious. This way he could claim that he'd just
misunderstood what Professor McGonagall had meant by
"afterward"...</p>
<p>The obscure pain clutched at Harry's heart again as he thought
of Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>So Harry retreated a little further into his dark side, which
had worn the calm expression and kept the fatigue off his face, and
kept walking.</p>
<p>There would come a reckoning, but sometimes you had to borrow
everything you could today, and let the payments come due
tomorrow.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Even Harry's dark side was feeling the exhaustion by the time
the spiraling staircase had delivered him to the great oaken door
that was the final gate to Dumbledore's office; but since Harry was
now <i>legally</i> four hours past his natural bedtime, it was safe
to let some of the fatigue show, the physical if not the
emotional.</p>
<p>The oaken door swung open -</p>
<p>Harry's eyes had already been focused in the direction of the
great desk, the throne behind it; so it took a moment to register
that the throne was empty, the desk barren but for a single
leatherbound volume; and then Harry shifted his gaze to see the
wizard standing among his fiddly things, the mysterious unknown
devices in their scores. Fawkes and the Sorting Hat occupied their
respective perches, a bright cheerful blaze crackled in a nook that
Harry had not before realized was a fireplace, and there were the
two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. All things in
their place and in their customary appearance except the old wizard
himself, standing tall and dressed in robes of the most formal
black. It came as a shock to the eyes, those robes on that person,
it was as if Harry had seen his father wearing a business suit.</p>
<p>Very ancient was the appearance of Albus Dumbledore, and
sorrowful.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry," said the old wizard.</p>
<p>From within an alternate self maintained like an Occlumency
construct, an innocent-Harry who had absolutely no idea what was
happening inclined his head coldly, and said, "Headmaster. I expect
you've heard back from Deputy Headmistress McGonagall by now, so if
it's fine by you, I would <i>really</i> like to know what is going
on."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the old wizard, "it is time, Harry Potter." The back
straightened, only slightly for the wizard had already been
standing straight; but somehow even that small change made the
wizard seem a foot taller, and stronger if not younger, formidable
though not dangerous, his potency gathered about him like a cowl.
In a clear voice, then, he spoke: "This day your war against
Voldemort has begun."</p>
<p>"What?" said the outer Harry who knew nothing, while something
watching from inside thought much the same only with a lot more
profanity attached.</p>
<p>"Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped
from a prison inescapable," the old wizard said. "It is a feat that
bears Voldemort's signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his
most faithful servant, is one of three requisites he must obtain to
rise again in a new body. After ten years the enemy you once
defeated has returned, as was foretold."</p>
<p>Neither part of Harry could think of anything to say to that, at
least not for the few seconds before the old wizard continued.</p>
<p>"It need change little for you, for now," said the old wizard.
"I have begun reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix that will
serve you, I have alerted the few souls who can and should
understand: Amelia Bones, Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain
others. Of the prophecy - yes, there is a prophecy - I have not
told them, but they know that Voldemort is returned, and they know
that you are to play some vital role. They and I shall fight your
war in its lesser beginnings, while you grow stronger, and perhaps
wiser, here at Hogwarts." The old wizard's hand came up, as though
beseeching. "So to you, for now, there is but one change, and I
implore you to understand its necessity. Do you recognize the book
on my desk, Harry?"</p>
<p>The inner part of Harry was screaming and banging its head
against imaginary walls, while the outer Harry turned and stared at
what proved to be -</p>
<p>There was a rather long pause.</p>
<p>Then Harry said, "It is a copy of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
by J. R. R. Tolkien."</p>
<p>"You recognized a quote from that book," said Dumbledore, an
intent look in his eyes, "so I assume you remember it well. If I am
mistaken, let me be corrected."</p>
<p>Harry just stared at him.</p>
<p>"It is important to understand," said Dumbledore, "that this
book is not a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien
never fought Voldemort. Your war will not be like the books you
have read. Real life is not like stories. Do you understand,
Harry?"</p>
<p>Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head
no.</p>
<p>"In particular," said Dumbledore, "there is a certain very
foolish thing that Gandalf does in the first book. He makes many
mistakes, does Tolkien's wizard; but this one error is the most
unforgivable. That mistake is this: When Gandalf first suspected,
even for a moment, that Frodo held the One Ring, he should have
moved Frodo to Rivendell <i>at once.</i> He might have been
embarrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicions had proven false.
He might have found it awkward to so command Frodo, and Frodo would
have been greatly inconvenienced, needing to set aside many other
plans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment, and awkwardness,
and inconvenience, is as nothing compared to the loss of your whole
war, when the nine Nazgul swoop down on the Shire while you are
reading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and take the Ring at once. And
it is not Frodo alone who would have been hurt; all Middle-Earth
would have fallen into slavery. If it had <i>not</i> been only a
story, Harry, they would have lost their war. Do you understand
what I am saying?"</p>
<p>"Er..." said Harry, "not exactly..." There was something about
Dumbledore when he was like this, which made it hard to stay
properly cold; his dark side had trouble with weird.</p>
<p>"Then I will spell it out," said the old wizard. His voice was
stern, his eyes were sad. "Frodo should have been moved to
Rivendell at once by Gandalf himself - and Frodo should never have
left Rivendell without guard. There should have been no night of
terror in Bree, no Barrow-downs, no Weathertop where Frodo was
wounded, they could have lost their entire war any of those times,
for Gandalf's folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to you,
son of Michael and Petunia?"</p>
<p>And the Harry who knew nothing did understand.</p>
<p>And the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart, the
wise, the intelligent and sane, the <i>right</i> thing to do.</p>
<p>And the Harry who knew nothing said just what an innocent Harry
<i>would</i> have said, while the silent watcher screamed in
confusion and agony.</p>
<p>"You're saying," Harry said, his voice shaking as the emotions
inside burned through the outer calm, "that I'm not going home to
my parents for Easter."</p>
<p>"You <i>will</i> see them again," the old wizard said swiftly.
"I will beg them to come here to be with you, I will extend them
every courtesy during their visits. But you are not going home for
Easter, Harry. You are not going home for the summer. You are no
longer taking lunches in Diagon Alley, even with Professor Quirrell
to watch you. Your blood is the second requisite Voldemort needs to
rise as strong as before. So you are never again leaving the bounds
of Hogwarts's wards without a vital reason, and a guard strong
enough to fend off any attack for long enough to get you to safety.
"</p>
<p>Water was beginning at the corners of Harry's eyes. "Is that a
request?" said his quavering voice. "Or an order?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Harry," the old wizard said softly. "Your parents
will see the necessity, I hope; but if not... I am afraid they have
no recourse; the law, however wrongly, does not recognize them as
your guardians. I am sorry, Harry, and I will understand if you
despise me for it, but it must be done."</p>
<p>Harry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn't look at
Dumbledore any more, couldn't trust his own face.</p>
<p><i>This is the cost to yourself,</i> said Hufflepuff within his
mind, <i>even as you imposed costs on others. Will that change your
whole view of the matter, the way Professor Quirrell thinks it
will?</i></p>
<p>Automatically, the mask of the innocent Harry said exactly what
it would have said: "Are my parents in danger? Do <i>they</i> need
to be moved here?"</p>
<p>"No," said the old wizard's voice. "I do not think so. The Death
Eaters learned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the
Order's families. And if Voldemort is now acting without his former
companions, he still knows that it is I who make the decisions for
now, and he knows that I would give him nothing for any threat to
your family. I have taught him that I do not give in to blackmail,
and so he will not try."</p>
<p>Harry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wizard's
face to match the shift in his voice, Dumbledore's blue eyes grown
hard as steel behind the glasses, it didn't match the person but it
matched the formal black robes.</p>
<p>"Is that everything, then?" said Harry's trembling voice. Later
he would think about this, later he would think of some cunning
countermeasure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was
any way to convince the Headmaster he was mistaken. Right now,
maintaining the mask was taking all of Harry's attention.</p>
<p>"Voldemort used a Muggle artifact to escape Azkaban," the old
wizard said. "He is watching you and learning from you, Harry
Potter. Soon a man named Arthur Weasley at the Ministry will issue
an edict that all use of Muggle artifacts must cease in the Defense
Professor's battles. In the future, when you have a good idea, keep
it closer about yourself."</p>
<p>It didn't seem important by comparison. Harry just nodded, and
said again, "Is that everything?"</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"Please," said the old wizard in a whisper. "I have no right to
ask your forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, but please,
at least say that you understand why." There was water in the old
wizard's eyes.</p>
<p>"I understand," said the voice of the outer Harry who did
understand, "I mean... I was sort of thinking about it anyway...
wondering whether I could get you and my parents to let me stay
over at Hogwarts during the summer like the orphans, so I could
read the library here, it's just more interesting at Hogwarts
anyway..."</p>
<p>A choking sound came from Albus Dumbledore's throat.</p>
<p>Harry turned again toward the door. It wasn't escape unscathed,
but it was escape.</p>
<p>He took a step forward.</p>
<p>His hand reached to the door-handle.</p>
<p>A piercing cry split the air -</p>
<p>As though in slow motion, as Harry spun, he saw the phoenix
already launched through the air and winging toward him.</p>
<p>From the true Harry, the one who knew his own guilt, came a
flash of panic, he hadn't thought of that, hadn't anticipated it,
he'd prepared to face Dumbledore but he'd forgotten about <i>Fawkes
-</i></p>
<p>Flap, flap, and flap, three times the phoenix's wings flapped
like the flaring up and dying down of a fire, duration seemed to
pass too slowly as Fawkes soared over the mysterious devices toward
where Harry stood.</p>
<p>And the red-golden bird was hovering in front of him with gentle
wing-sweeps, bobbing in the air like a candle-flame.</p>
<p>"What is it, Fawkes?" said the false Harry in puzzlement,
looking the phoenix in the eyes, as he would if he were innocent.
The real Harry, feeling the same awful sickness inside as when
Professor McGonagall had expressed her trust in him, thought,
<i>Did I turn evil today, Fawkes? I didn't think I was evil... Do
you hate me now? If I've become something a phoenix hates, maybe I
should just give it up now, give up everything now and confess
-</i></p>
<p>Fawkes screamed, the most terrible cry Harry had ever heard, a
scream that set all the devices vibrating and made all the sleeping
figures start within their portraits.</p>
<p>It pierced through all of Harry's defenses like a white-hot
sword through butter, collapsed all his layers like a punctured
balloon popping, reshuffled his priorities in an instant as he
remembered the one most important thing; the tears began pouring
freely from Harry's eyes, down his cheeks, his voice choked as the
words came out of his throat like coughing up lava -</p>
<p>"Fawkes says," Harry's voice said, "he wants me, to do,
something, about, the prisoners, in Azkaban -"</p>
<p>"Fawkes, <i>no!</i>" said the old wizard. Dumbledore strode
forward, reaching out to the phoenix with a pleading hand. The old
wizard's voice was almost as desperate as the phoenix's scream had
been. "You cannot ask that of him, Fawkes, he's only a boy
still!"</p>
<p>"You went to Azkaban," Harry whispered, "you took Fawkes with
you, he saw - <i>you</i> saw - you were <i>there</i>, you saw -
<i>WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING? WHY DIDN'T YOU LET THEM
OUT?</i>"</p>
<p>When the instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized that
Fawkes had screamed at the same time as his own scream, that the
phoenix was now flying next to Harry and facing Dumbledore at his
side, the red-golden head level with his own.</p>
<p>"Can you," whispered the old wizard, "can you truly hear the
voice of the phoenix so clearly?"</p>
<p>Harry was sobbing almost too hard to speak, for all the metal
doors he'd passed, the voices he'd heard, the worst memories, the
desperate begging as he walked away, all of it had burst into his
mind like fire at the phoenix's scream, all the inner bulwarks
smashed. Harry didn't know whether he could truly hear the voice of
the phoenix so clearly, whether he would have understood Fawkes
without already knowing. All Harry knew was that he had a plausible
excuse to say the things Professor Quirrell had told him he must
<i>never</i> raise in conversation from this day forth; because
this was just what an innocent Harry would have said, would have
done, if he <i>had</i> heard so clearly. "They're hurting - we have
to help them -"</p>
<p>"I <i>can't!</i>" cried Albus Dumbledore. "Harry, Fawkes, I
<i>can't</i>, there's nothing I can do!"</p>
<p>Another piercing scream.</p>
<p>"<i>WHY NOT? JUST GO IN AND TAKE THEM OUT!"</i></p>
<p>The old wizard wrenched his gaze from the phoenix, his eyes
meeting Harry's instead. "Harry, tell Fawkes for me! Tell him it's
not that simple! Phoenixes aren't mere animals but they <i>are</i>
animals, Harry, they can't understand -"</p>
<p>"I don't understand either," Harry said, his voice trembling. "I
don't understand why you're <i>feeding people to Dementors! Azkaban
isn't a prison, it's a torture chamber and you're torturing those
people to DEATH!</i>"</p>
<p>"Percival," said the old wizard hoarsely, "Percival Dumbledore,
my own father, Harry, my own father died in Azkaban! I know, I know
it is a horror! <i>But what would you have of me?</i> To break
Azkaban by force? Would you have me declare open rebellion against
the Ministry?"</p>
<p>CAW!</p>
<p>There was a pause, and Harry's trembling voice said, "Fawkes
doesn't know anything about governments, he just wants you - to
take the prisoners out - of their cells - and he'll help you fight,
if anyone stands in your way - and - and so will I, Headmaster!
I'll go with you and destroy any Dementor that comes near! We'll
worry about the political fallout afterward, I bet that you and I
together could get away with it -"</p>
<p>"Harry," whispered the old wizard, "phoenixes do not understand
how winning a battle can lose a war." Tears were streaming down the
old wizard's cheeks, dripping into his silver beard. "The battle is
all they know. They are good, but not wise. That is why they choose
wizards to be their masters."</p>
<p>"Can you bring out the Dementors to where I can get at them?"
Harry's voice was begging, now. "Bring them out in groups of
fifteen - I think I could destroy that many at a time without
hurting myself -"</p>
<p>The old wizard shook his head. "It was hard enough to pass off
the loss of one - they might give me one more, but never two - they
are considered national possessions, Harry, weapons in case of war
-"</p>
<p>Fury blazed in Harry then, blazed up like fire, it might have
come from where a phoenix now rested on his own shoulder, and it
might have come from his own dark side, and the two angers mixed
within him, the cold and the hot, and it was a strange voice that
said from his throat, "Tell me something. What does a government
have to do, what do the voters have to do with their democracy,
what do the <i>people</i> of a <i>country</i> have to do, before I
ought to decide that I'm not on their side any more?"</p>
<p>The old wizard's eyes widened where he stared at the boy with a
phoenix upon his shoulder. "Harry... are those your words, or the
Defense Professor's -"</p>
<p>"Because there has to be <i>some</i> point, doesn't there? And
if it's not Azkaban, where is it, then?"</p>
<p>"Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could not live together
if they each declared rebellion against the whole, every time they
differed! Always there will be <i>something</i> -"</p>
<p>"<i>Azkaban is not just something! It's evil!</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes, even evil! Even some evils, Harry, for wizards are not
perfectly good! And yet it is better that we live in peace, than in
chaos; and for you and I to break Azkaban by force would be the
beginning of <i>chaos</i>, can you not see it?" The old wizard's
voice was pleading. "And it is possible to oppose the will of your
fellows openly or in secret, without <i>hating</i> them, without
declaring them evil and enemy! I do not think the people of this
country deserve that of you, Harry! And even if some of them did -
what of the children, what of the students in Hogwarts, what of the
many good people mixed in with the bad?"</p>
<p>Harry looked on his shoulder at where Fawkes had perched, saw
the phoenix's eyes gazing back at him, they did not glow and yet
they blazed, red flames in a sea of golden fire.</p>
<p><i>What do you think, Fawkes?</i></p>
<p>"Caw?" said the phoenix.</p>
<p>Fawkes didn't understand the conversation.</p>
<p>The young boy looked at the old wizard, and said in a thick
voice, "Or maybe the phoenixes are wiser than us, smarter than us,
maybe they follow us around hoping that someday we'll <i>listen</i>
to them, someday we'll <i>get</i> it, someday we'll just
<i>take</i>, the prisoners, <i>out,</i> of their <i>cells
-</i>"</p>
<p>Harry spun and pulled open the oaken door and stepped onto the
staircase and slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, and he put
his face in his hands, and began to weep.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he was halfway to the bottom that he noticed the
difference, noticed the warmth still spreading through him, and
realized that -</p>
<p>"Fawkes?" Harry whispered.</p>
<p>- the phoenix was still on his shoulder, perched there as he had
seen him a few times upon Dumbledore's.</p>
<p>Harry looked again into the eyes, red flames in golden fire.</p>
<p>"You're not my phoenix now... are you?"</p>
<p>Caw!</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said, his voice trembling a little, "I'm glad to
hear that, Fawkes, because I don't think - the Headmaster - I don't
think he deserves -"</p>
<p>Harry stopped, took a breath.</p>
<p>"I don't think he deserves that, Fawkes, he was trying to do the
right thing..."</p>
<p>Caw!</p>
<p>"But you're angry at him and trying to make a point. I
understand."</p>
<p>The phoenix nestled his head against Harry's shoulder, and the
stone gargoyle walked smoothly aside to let Harry pass back into
the corridors of Hogwarts.</p>
</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="63">Chapter 63</h2><h3>TSPE, Aftermaths</h3>
<p><i>Aftermath, Hermione Granger:</i></p>
<p>She was just starting to close up her books and put away her
homework in preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up
their own books across the table from her, when Harry Potter walked
into the Ravenclaw common room; and it was only then that she
realized, she hadn't seen him at all since breakfast.</p>
<p>That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling
one.</p>
<p>There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry's shoulder, a
bright bird of fire.</p>
<p>And Harry looked sad and worn and really <i>tired</i> like the
phoenix was the only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was
still a warmth about him, if you crossed your eyes you might have
thought you were looking at the Headmaster somehow, that was the
impression that went through Hermione's mind even though it didn't
make any sense.</p>
<p>Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past
sofas full of staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys,
heading for her.</p>
<p>In theory she wasn't talking to Harry Potter yet, his week
wasn't up until tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a
<i>whole</i> lot more important than that -</p>
<p>"Fawkes," Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, "that
girl over there is Hermione Granger, she's not talking to me right
now because I'm an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person's
shoulder she's better than me."</p>
<p>So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter's voice -</p>
<p>But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix
had glided off Harry's shoulder like a fire creeping up a
matchstick on fast-forward, flashing toward her; there was a
phoenix flying in front of her and staring at her with eyes of
light and flame.</p>
<p>"<i>Caw?</i>" asked the phoenix.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on
a test she'd forgotten to study for, the one most important
question and she'd gone her whole life without studying for it, she
couldn't find anything to say.</p>
<p>"I'm -" she said. "I'm only twelve, I haven't <i>done</i>
anything yet -"</p>
<p>The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one
wingtip like the being of light and air that it was, and soared
back to Harry Potter's shoulder, where it settled down quite
firmly.</p>
<p>"You silly boy," said Padma across from her, looking like she
was deciding whether to laugh or grimace, "phoenixes aren't for
smart girls who do their homework, they're for idiots who charge
straight at five older Slytherin bullies. There's a reason why the
Gryffindor colors are red and gold, you know."</p>
<p>There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common
room.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't one of the laughing ones.</p>
<p>Neither was Harry.</p>
<p>Harry had put a hand over his face. "Tell Hermione I'm sorry,"
he said to Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. "Tell her I
forgot that phoenixes are animals, they don't understand time and
planning, they don't understand people who are <i>going</i> to do
good things later - I'm not sure they understand really the notion
of there being something that a person <i>is</i>, all they see is
what people do. Fawkes doesn't know what twelve means. Tell
Hermione I'm sorry - I shouldn't have - it just all goes wrong,
doesn't it?"</p>
<p>Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began
slowly trudging toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.</p>
<p>And Hermione couldn't leave it at that, she just <i>couldn't</i>
leave it at that. She didn't know if it was her competition with
Harry or something else. She just couldn't leave it with the
phoenix turning away from her.</p>
<p>She <i>had</i> to -</p>
<p>Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her
excellent memory, found just one thing -</p>
<p>"I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save
Harry!" she shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. "I
mean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid
and courageous, right?"</p>
<p>With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry's
shoulder again, back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled
her three times like she was the center of an inferno, and for just
a moment its wing brushed against her cheek, before the phoenix
soared back to Harry.</p>
<p>There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.</p>
<p>"Told you so," Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing
the stairs up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like
he was very light on his feet for some reason, so that in just a
moment he and Fawkes were gone.</p>
<p>Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had
brushed her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like
that one small patch of skin had been very gently set on fire.</p>
<p>She'd answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it
felt to her like she'd just barely squeaked by on the test, like
she'd gotten a 62 and she could've gotten 104 if she'd tried
harder.</p>
<p>If she'd tried at <i>all</i>.</p>
<p>She hadn't really <i>been</i> trying, when she thought about
it.</p>
<p>Just doing her homework -</p>
<p><i>Who have you saved?</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Fawkes:</i></p>
<p>Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and
howling hurricanes of emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being
laid down into memory, and in that fashion, perhaps, becoming part
of the past.</p>
<p>And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.</p>
<p>The next night, they would come.</p>
<p>The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire,
Hogwarts was on fire, his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford
were on fire, all ablaze with golden flames that shone but did not
consume, and all the people walking through the blazing streets
were shining with white light brighter than the fire, like they
were flames themselves, or stars.</p>
<p>The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for
themselves, the wonder whose rumor they had already heard, that in
his bed Harry Potter lay silent and motionless, a gentle smile on
his face, while perched on his pillow a red-golden bird watched
over him, with bright wings swept above him like a blanket pulled
over his head.</p>
<p>The reckoning had been put off one more night.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:</i></p>
<p>Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was
straight. He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm that
Father had taught him while other children were still playing in
mud, a Charm which ensured that not a single speck of lint or dust
would dirty his wizard's robes.</p>
<p>Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled
him, and tucked it into his robes. He had already used
<i>Incendio</i> and <i>Everto</i> on the mysterious note.</p>
<p>And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly
the same tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could
manage it, so that it would seem like all others had been waiting
on his appearance to eat. Because when you were the scion of Malfoy
you were first in everything, including breakfast, that was
why.</p>
<p>Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his
private room, up even before he was - though not, of course,
dressed quite as sharply.</p>
<p>The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this
early was heading straight to breakfast anyway.</p>
<p>The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty
and echoing.</p>
<p>The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few
arrivals, some younger children crying, students running back and
forth between tables or standing in knots shouting at each other, a
red-robed prefect was standing in front of two green-trimmed
students and yelling at them and Snape was striding toward the mess
-</p>
<p>The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as
some of the faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.</p>
<p>The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.</p>
<p>And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed
straight toward Draco.</p>
<p>A knot of fear clutched at Draco's heart, had something happened
to Father - no, surely Father would have told him - whatever was
happening, why hadn't Father told him -</p>
<p>There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape's eyes, Draco saw as
their Head of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a
sharp dresser (that was an understatement) but his robes were even
dirtier and more disarrayed this morning, spotted with extra
grease.</p>
<p>"You haven't heard?" hissed their Head of House as he came
close. "For pity's sake, Malfoy, don't you have a newspaper
delivered?"</p>
<p>"What is it, Profe-"</p>
<p>"Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him said
something he really shouldn't have and Vincent just gasped.</p>
<p>Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded
abruptly. "Lucius told you nothing, then. I see." Snape gave a
snort, turned away -</p>
<p>"Professor!" said Draco. The implications were just starting to
dawn on him, his mind spinning frantically. "Professor, what should
I do - Father didn't instruct me -"</p>
<p>"Then I <i>suggest</i>," Snape said sneeringly, as he strode
away, "that you <i>tell</i> them that, Malfoy, as your father
intended!"</p>
<p>Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn't know
why he was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than
he did.</p>
<p>And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at
the far end, which was still empty of sitters.</p>
<p>Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with
automatic motions.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.</p>
<p>Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban...?</p>
<p>Draco didn't know what to make of that, it was as totally
unexpected as the Sun going out - well, the Sun would expectedly go
out in six billion years but this was as unexpected as the Sun
going out <i>tomorrow</i>. Father wouldn't have done it, Dumbledore
wouldn't have done it, <i>no one</i> should have been <i>able</i>
to do it - what did it <i>mean</i> - what <i>use</i> would
Bellatrix be to anyone after ten years in Azkaban - even if she got
strong again, what use was a powerful sorceress who was completely
evil and insane and fanatically devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn't
around anymore?</p>
<p>"Hey," said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, "I
don't understand, boss, why'd we do that?"</p>
<p>"<i>We</i> didn't do it, you dolt!" snapped Draco. "Oh, for
Merlin's sake, if even <i>you</i> think we - didn't your father
ever tell you any stories about Bellatrix Black? She tortured
Father once, she tortured <i>your</i> father, she's tortured
<i>everyone,</i> the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio
<i>herself</i> and she <i>did it!</i> She didn't do crazy things to
inspire fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy things
because she's crazy! She's a <i>bitch</i> is what she is!"</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" said an incensed voice from behind Draco.</p>
<p>Draco didn't look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching his
back.</p>
<p>"I would've thought you'd be happy -"</p>
<p>"- to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!"</p>
<p>Amycus Carrow had always been one of the <i>other</i> problem
people; Father had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone
in the same room with Amycus...</p>
<p>Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number
Three Sneer, the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most
Ancient House and they weren't and yes, that mattered. Draco said
in their general direction, certainly not deigning to address
<i>them</i> in particular, "There's Death Eaters and then there's
Death Eaters," and then turned back to his food.</p>
<p>There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of
shoes stormed off toward the other end of the Slytherin table.</p>
<p>It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to
them, visibly out of breath, and said, "Mr. Malfoy, did you
hear?"</p>
<p>"About Bellatrix Black?" said Draco. "Yeah -"</p>
<p>"No, about Potter!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Potter was going around with a <i>phoenix</i> on his shoulder
last night, looking like he'd been dragged through ten leagues of
mud, they say that the phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop
Bellatrix and he fought a duel with her and they blew up half the
fortress!"</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Draco. "Oh, there is just no <i>way</i>
that -"</p>
<p>Draco stopped.</p>
<p>He'd said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had
started to notice a trend.</p>
<p>Millicent ran off to tell someone else.</p>
<p>"You don't <i>really</i> think -" said Gregory.</p>
<p>"I honestly don't know anymore," said Draco.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across
from him and William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins,
Vincent nudged him and said, "There."</p>
<p>Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Draco watched him closely.</p>
<p>There was no alarm on Harry's face as he saw, no surprise or
shock, he just looked...</p>
<p>It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he
was trying to figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn't
understand yet.</p>
<p>Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin
table, saying "Stay behind," and walked with all decorous speed
toward Harry.</p>
<p>Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was
turning toward the Ravenclaw table, and Draco -</p>
<p>- gave Harry one quick look -</p>
<p>- and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great
Hall.</p>
<p>It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the
small stony nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone
but it would create plausible deniability.</p>
<p>"<i>Quietus</i>," said Harry. "Draco, what -"</p>
<p>Draco took the envelope out of his robes. "I have a message for
you from Father."</p>
<p>"<i>Huh?</i>" said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco, and
tore it open in a rather un-neat manner, and drew forth a sheet of
parchment and unfolded it and -</p>
<p>Harry gave a sharp intake of breath.</p>
<p>Then Harry looked at Draco.</p>
<p>Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Harry said, "Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to
this?"</p>
<p>Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth
-</p>
<p>"I see he did," said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he
should've known better, only it <i>had</i> been hard to decide.
"What are you going to tell him?"</p>
<p>"That you were surprised," said Draco.</p>
<p>"Surprised," Harry said flatly. "Yeah. Good. Tell him that."</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> it?" said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry
looking conflicted, "If you're dealing with Father behind my back
-"</p>
<p>And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper.</p>
<p>It said:</p>
<p><i>I know it was you.</i></p>
<p>"<i>WHAT THE -</i>"</p>
<p>"I was going to ask <i>you</i> that," said Harry. "Have you got
<i>any</i> idea what's up with your Dad?"</p>
<p>Draco stared at Harry.</p>
<p>Then Draco said, "<i>Did</i> you do it?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Harry. "What <i>possible</i> reason would I -
<i>how</i> would I -"</p>
<p>"Did you do it, Harry?"</p>
<p>"No!" Harry said. "Of course not!"</p>
<p>Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn't detected any
hesitation or tremor.</p>
<p>So Draco nodded, and said, "I've got no idea what Father's
thinking but it <i>can't</i>, I mean it <i>can't possibly</i> be
good. And, um... people are also saying..."</p>
<p>"What," said Harry warily, "are they saying, Draco?"</p>
<p>"Did a phoenix <i>really</i> take you to Azkaban to try to stop
Bellatrix Black from escaping -"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Neville Longbottom</i></p>
<p>Harry had only just sat down at the Ravenclaw table for the
first time, hoping to grab a quick bite of food. He knew he needed
to go off and think about things, but there was a tiny remaining
bit of phoenix's peace (even after the encounter with Draco) that
he still wanted to cling to, some beautiful dream of which he
remembered nothing but the beauty; and the part of him that
<i>wasn't</i> feeling peaceful was waiting for all the anvils to
finish dropping on him, so that when he went off to think and be by
himself for a while, he could batch-process all the disasters at
once.</p>
<p>Harry's hand grasped a fork, lifted a bite of mashed potatoes
toward his mouth -</p>
<p>And there was a shriek.</p>
<p>Every now and then someone would shout when they heard the news,
but Harry's ears <i>recognized</i> this one -</p>
<p>Harry was up from the bench in an instant, heading toward the
Hufflepuff table, a horrible sick feeling dawning in the pit of his
stomach. It was one of those things he hadn't considered when he'd
decided to commit the crime, because Professor Quirrell had planned
for no one to know; and now, afterward, Harry just - hadn't
<i>thought</i> of it -</p>
<p><i>This,</i> Hufflepuff said with bitter intensity, <i>is also
your fault.</i></p>
<p>But by the time Harry got there, Neville was sitting down and
eating fried sausage patties with Snippyfig Sauce.</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff boy's hands were trembling, but he cut the food,
and ate it, without dropping it.</p>
<p>"Hello, General," Neville said, his voice wavering only
slightly. "Did you fight a duel with Bellatrix Black last
night?"</p>
<p>"No," Harry said. His own voice was also wavery, for some
reason.</p>
<p>"Didn't think so," said Neville. There was a scraping sound as
his knife cut the sausage again. "I'm going to hunt her down and
kill her, can I count on you to help?"</p>
<p>There were startled gasps from the mass of Hufflepuffs who had
gathered around Neville.</p>
<p>"If she comes after you," Harry said hoarsely, <i>if it was all
a terrible mistake, if it was all a lie,</i> "I'll defend you even
with my life," <i>won't let you get hurt for what I did, no matter
what,</i> "but I won't help you go after her, Neville, friends
don't help friends commit suicide."</p>
<p>Neville's fork paused on the way to his mouth.</p>
<p>Then Neville put the bite of food in his mouth, chewed
again.</p>
<p>And Neville swallowed it.</p>
<p>And Neville said, "I didn't mean <i>right now</i>, I mean after
I graduate Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Neville," Harry said, keeping his voice under very careful
control, "I think, even after you graduate, that might still be a
<i>just plain</i> <i>stupid idea.</i> There's got to be much more
experienced Aurors tracking her -" <i>oh, wait, that's not good</i>
-</p>
<p>"Listen to him!" said Ernie Macmillan, and then an older-looking
Hufflepuff girl standing close to Neville said, "Nevvy, please,
think about it, he's right!"</p>
<p>Neville stood up.</p>
<p>Neville said, "Please don't follow me."</p>
<p>Neville walked away from all of them; Harry and Ernie reaching
out involuntarily toward him, and some of the other Hufflepuffs as
well.</p>
<p>And Neville sat down at the Gryffindor table, and distantly
(though they had to strain to hear) they heard Neville say, "I'm
going to hunt her down and kill her after I graduate, anyone want
to help?" and at least five voices said "Yes" and then Ron Weasley
said loudly, "Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum this
morning, she says to tell everyone she's called dibs" and someone
said "<i>Molly Weasley</i> against <i>Bellatrix Black?</i> Who does
she even think she's kidding -" and Ron reached over to a plate and
hefted a muffin -</p>
<p>Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder, and he turned around and
saw an unfamiliar green-trimmed older girl, who handed him a
parchment envelope and then quickly strode away.</p>
<p>Harry stared at the envelope for a moment, then started walking
toward the nearest wall. That wasn't very private, but it should be
private enough, and Harry didn't want to give the impression of
having much to hide.</p>
<p>That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if you
wanted to communicate with someone without anyone else knowing that
the two of you had talked. The sender gave an envelope to someone
who had a reputation for being a reliable messenger, along with ten
Knuts; that first person would take five Knuts and pass the
envelope to another messenger along with the other five Knuts, and
the second messenger would open up that envelope and find another
envelope with a name written on it and deliver that envelope to
that person. That way neither of the two people passing the message
knew both the sender <i>and</i> the recipient, so no one else knew
that those two parties had been in contact...</p>
<p>When Harry reached the wall, he put the envelope inside his
robes, opened it beneath the folds of cloth, and carefully snuck a
peek at the parchment he drew forth.</p>
<p>It said,</p>
<p><i>Classroom to the left of Transfiguration, 8 in the
morning.</i></p>
<p><i>- LL.</i></p>
<p>Harry stared at it, trying to remember if he knew anyone with
the initials LL.</p>
<p>His mind searched...</p>
<p>Searched...</p>
<p>Retrieved -</p>
<p>"The <i>Quibbler</i> girl?" Harry whispered incredulously, and
then shut his mouth. She was only ten years old, she shouldn't be
in Hogwarts at all!</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.</i></p>
<p>Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to
Transfiguration at 8AM, waiting, he'd at least managed to get some
food into himself before facing the next disaster, Luna
Lovegood...</p>
<p>The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave
himself a really <i>hard</i> mental kick.</p>
<p>One more thing he hadn't thought of, one more thing he <i>really
should have.</i></p>
<p>The older boy's green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there
were red spots on them looking very much like small dots of fresh
blood, and one corner of his mouth had the look of a place that had
been cut and healed, by <i>Episkey</i> or some other minor medical
Charm that didn't quite erase all the damage.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange's face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and
half-dried tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of
still more on the way. "<i>Quietus,</i>" said the older boy, and
then "<i>Homenum Revelio</i>" and some other things, while Harry
thought frantically and without much luck.</p>
<p>And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes,
and slowly this time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees
on the dusty classroom floor.</p>
<p>Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched
the dust, and Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless.</p>
<p>Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, "My life is yours,
my Lord, and my death as well."</p>
<p>"I," Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was
having trouble speaking, "I -" <i>didn't have anything to do with
it,</i> he should have been saying, should be saying <i>right
now,</i> but then again the innocent Harry would have had trouble
speaking too -</p>
<p>"Thank you," whispered Lesath, "thank you, my Lord, oh, thank
you," the sound of a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all
Harry could see of him was the hair on the back of his head,
nothing of his face. "I'm a fool, my Lord, an ungrateful bastard,
unworthy to serve you, I cannot abase myself enough, for I - I
shouted at you after you helped me, because I thought you were
refusing me, and I didn't even realize until this morning that I'd
been such a fool as to ask you in front of Longbottom -"</p>
<p>"I didn't have anything to do with it," Harry said.</p>
<p>(It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.)</p>
<p>Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at
Harry.</p>
<p>"I understand, my Lord," said the older boy, his voice wavering
a little, "you do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown
myself a fool... I only wanted to say to you, that I am not
ungrateful, that I know it must have been hard enough to save only
one person, that they're alerted now, that you can't - get Father -
but I am not ungrateful, I will never be ungrateful to you again.
If ever you have a use for this unworthy servant, call me wherever
I am, and I will answer, my Lord -"</p>
<p>"I was not involved in any way."</p>
<p>(But it got easier each time.)</p>
<p>Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, "Am I dismissed from
your presence, my Lord...?"</p>
<p>"I am not your Lord."</p>
<p>Lesath said, "Yes, my Lord, I understand," and pushed himself
back up from the floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then
backed away from Harry until he turned to open the classroom
door.</p>
<p>As Lesath's hand touched the doorknob, he paused.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't see Lesath's face, as the older boy's voice said,
"Did you send her to someone who would take care of her? Did she
ask about me at all?"</p>
<p>And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, "Please stop that. I
was not involved in any way."</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord, I'm sorry, my Lord," said Lesath's voice; and the
Slytherin boy opened the door and went out and shut the door behind
him. His feet sped up as he ran away, but not fast enough that
Harry couldn't hear him start sobbing.</p>
<p><i>Would I cry?</i> wondered Harry. <i>If I knew nothing, if I
was innocent, would I cry right now?</i></p>
<p>Harry didn't know, so he just kept looking at the door.</p>
<p>And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, <i>Yay, we
completed a quest and got a minion -</i></p>
<p><i>Shut up. If you ever want to vote on anything ever again...
shut up.</i></p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Amelia Bones:</i></p>
<p>"Then his life isn't in danger, I take it," said Amelia.</p>
<p>The healer, a stern-eyed old man who wore his robes white (he
was a Muggleborn and honoring some strange tradition of Muggles, of
which Amelia had never asked, although privately she thought it
made him look too much like a ghost), shook his head and said,
"Definitely not."</p>
<p>Amelia looked at the human form resting unconscious on the
healer's bed, the burned and blasted flesh, the thin sheet that
covered him for modesty's sake having been peeled back at her
command.</p>
<p>He might make a full recovery.</p>
<p>He might not.</p>
<p>The healer had said it was too early to say.</p>
<p>Then Amelia looked at the other witch in the room, the
detective.</p>
<p>"And you say," Amelia said, "that the burning matter was
Transfigured from <i>water</i>, presumably in the form of ice."</p>
<p>The detective nodded her head, and said, sounding puzzled, "It
could have been much worse, if not for -"</p>
<p>"How <i>very nice</i> of them," she spat, and then pressed a
weary hand to her forehead. No... no, it <i>had</i> been intended
as a kindness. By the final stage of the escape there would be no
point in trying to fool anyone. Whoever had done this, then,
<i>had</i> been trying to mitigate the damage - and they'd been
thinking in terms of Aurors breathing the smoke, not of anyone
being attacked with the fire. If it had been them still in control,
no doubt, they would have steered the rocker more mercifully.</p>
<p>But Bellatrix Black had ridden the rocker out of Azkaban alone,
all the watching Aurors had agreed on that, they'd had their
Anti-Disillusionment Charms active and there had been only one
woman on that rocker, though the rocker had sported two sets of
stirrups.</p>
<p>Some good and innocent person, capable of casting the Patronus
Charm, had been tricked into rescuing Bellatrix Black.</p>
<p>Some innocent had fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing an
experienced Auror without significantly injuring him.</p>
<p>Some innocent had Transfigured the fuel for the Muggle artifact
on which the two of them had been to ride out of Azkaban, making it
from frozen water for the benefit of her Aurors.</p>
<p>And then their usefulness to Bellatrix Black had ended.</p>
<p>You would have expected anyone capable of subduing Bahry
One-Hand to have foreseen that part. But then you wouldn't have
expected anyone who could cast the Patronus Charm to try rescuing
Bellatrix Black in the first place.</p>
<p>Amelia passed her hand down over her eyes, closing them for a
moment in silent mourning. <i>I wonder who it was, and how
You-Know-Who manipulated them... what story they could</i> possibly
<i>have been told...</i></p>
<p>She didn't even realize until a moment later that the thought
meant she was starting to believe. Perhaps because, no matter how
difficult it was to believe Dumbledore, it was becoming more
difficult <i>not</i> to recognize the hand of that cold, dark
intelligence.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:</i></p>
<p>It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast
ended and he might have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but
in the end, Albus Dumbledore did make it.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius
Flitwick, as the old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat.
"Mr. Potter left a message for you."</p>
<p>The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms
Professor.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair
had been the things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr.
Potter said that he wasn't saying anything about anything else,
just apologizing for that one part."</p>
<p>The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still
did not speak.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" squeaked Filius.</p>
<p>"Tell him I said thank you," said Albus Dumbledore, "but that it
is wiser to listen to phoenixes than to wise old wizards," and sat
down at his place three seconds before all the food vanished.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Professor Quirrell:</i></p>
<p>"No," Madam Pomfrey snapped at the child, "you may <i>not</i>
see him! You may not <i>pester</i> him! You may not ask him <i>one
little question!</i> He is to rest <i>in bed</i> and do
<i>nothing</i> for at least <i>three days!</i>"</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:</i></p>
<p>She was heading toward the infirmary, and Harry Potter was
leaving it, when they passed each other.</p>
<p>The look he gave her wasn't angry.</p>
<p>It wasn't sad.</p>
<p>It didn't say much at all.</p>
<p>It was like... like he was looking at her just long enough to
make it clear that he <i>wasn't</i> deliberately avoiding looking
at her.</p>
<p>And then he looked away before she could figure out what look to
give him in return; as though he wanted to spare her that, as
well.</p>
<p>He didn't say anything as he walked past her.</p>
<p>Neither did she.</p>
<p>What could there possibly be to say?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Fred and George Weasley:</i></p>
<p>They actually yelped out loud, when they turned the corner and
saw Dumbledore.</p>
<p>It wasn't that the Headmaster had popped up out of nowhere and
was staring at them with a stern expression. Dumbledore was always
doing <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>But the wizard was dressed in formal black robes and looking
<i>very</i> ancient and <i>very</i> powerful and he was giving the
two of them a SHARP LOOK.</p>
<p>"Fred and George Weasley!" spake Dumbledore in a Voice of
Power.</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster!" they said, snapping upright and giving him a
crisp military salute they'd seen in some old pictures.</p>
<p>"Hear me well! You are the friends of Harry Potter, is this
so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster!"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is in danger. He <i>must not</i> go beyond the
wards of Hogwarts. Listen to me, sons of Weasley, I beg you listen:
you know that I am as Gryffindor as yourselves, that I too know
there are higher rules than rules. But this, Fred and George, this
one thing is of the most terrible importance, there must be no
exception this time, small or great! If you help Harry to leave
Hogwarts he may <i>die!</i> Does he send you on a mission, you may
go, does he ask you to bring him items, you may help, but if he
asks you to smuggle his own person out of Hogwarts, you <i>must
refuse!</i> Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster!" They said it without even thinking, really,
and then exchanged uncertain looks with each other -</p>
<p>The bright blue eyes of the Headmaster were intent upon them.
"No. Not without thinking. If Harry asks you to bring him out, you
must refuse, if he asks you to tell him the way, you must refuse. I
will not ask you to report him to me, for that I know you would
never do. But beg him on my behalf to go to <i>me,</i> if it is of
such importance, and <i>I</i> will guard him as he walks. Fred,
George, I am sorry to strain your friendship so, but it is his
<i>life.</i>"</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other for a long while, not
communicating, only thinking the same things at the same time.</p>
<p>They looked back at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>They said, with a chill running through them as they spoke the
name, "Bellatrix Black."</p>
<p>"You may safely assume," said the Headmaster, "that it is at
least that bad."</p>
<p>"Okay -"</p>
<p>"- got it."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:</i></p>
<p>When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the
services of a most erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody
mistrusted slightly less than average because Moody had refrained
from reporting him as an unregistered werewolf; and he had paid
Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye, and every known
hint to their location.</p>
<p>When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn't bothered reading
most of it; because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance,
dating back to an era before Hogwarts, and currently in the
possession of a powerful Dark Wizard ruling over some tiny
forgotten hellhole that wasn't in Britain or anywhere else he'd
have to worry about silly rules.</p>
<p>That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired
the Eye of Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been
liberated for a period of around two weeks before another Dark
Wizard moved in on the power vacuum.</p>
<p>He'd considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had
decided against it after he realized that would be <i>just what
they were expecting.</i></p>
<p>Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying
the graveyard of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot
gloomier, that place, but in the broad daylight it seemed like
nothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary tombstones,
demarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal
that Muggles used instead of wards. (Moody could not comprehend
what the Muggles were thinking on that score, if they were
<i>pretending</i> to have wards, or what, and he had decided not to
ask whether Muggle criminals respected the pretense.)</p>
<p>Moody didn't actually <i>need</i> to turn to survey the
graveyard.</p>
<p>The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every
direction around him, no matter where it was pointing.</p>
<p>But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater
like Severus Snape know that.</p>
<p>Sometimes people called Moody 'paranoid'.</p>
<p>Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting
Dark Wizards and then get back to him about that.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, in
retrospect, to achieve what he now considered a decent level of
caution - weighed up how much experience it had taken him to get
<i>good</i> instead of <i>lucky</i> - and had begun to suspect that
most people died before they got there. Moody had once expressed
this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering and figuring,
and told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die, on
average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming
'paranoid'. This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn't
lying.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the Dark
Lord had used unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his
body, and was now awake and abroad, seeking to regain his power and
begin the Wizarding War anew.</p>
<p>Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you lot never told me about this resurrection
thing," Mad-Eye Moody said with considerable acerbity. "D'you
realize how long it'll take me to do the grave of every ancestor of
every Dark Wizard I've ever killed who could've been smart enough
to make a horcrux? You're not just <i>now</i> doing this one, are
you?"</p>
<p>"I redose this one every year," Severus Snape said calmly,
uncapping the third flask of what the man had <i>claimed</i> would
be seventeen bottles, and beginning to wave his wand over it. "The
other ancestral graves we've been able to locate were poisoned with
only the long-lasting substances, since some of us have less free
time than yourself."</p>
<p>Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing,
to appear within the bones where marrow had once been. "But you
think it's worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing
the bones."</p>
<p>"He <i>does</i> have other avenues to life, should he perceive
this one blocked," Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle.
"And before you ask, it must be the original grave, the place of
first burial, the bone removed during the ritual and not before.
Thus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also there is no
point in substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor. He would
notice it had lost all potency."</p>
<p>"Who else knows about this trap?" Moody demanded.</p>
<p>"You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else."</p>
<p>Moody snorted. "Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that
McGonagall woman about the resurrection ritual?"</p>
<p>"Yes -"</p>
<p>"If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection
ritual and that Albus told <i>them</i>, Voldie'll figure that Albus
told <i>me,</i> and Voldie <i>knows</i> I'd think of this." Moody
shook his head in disgust. "What're these other ways Voldie could
come back to life?"</p>
<p>Snape's hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all
Disillusioned, of course, the whole operation was Disillusioned,
but that meant less than nothing to Moody, it just marked you in
his Eye's sight as trying-to-hide), and the former Death Eater
said, "You don't need to know."</p>
<p>"You're learning, son," said Moody with mild approval. "What's
in the bottles?"</p>
<p>Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin
the substance flowing toward the grave, and said, "This one? A
Muggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put me in mind
of Muggle things, and LSD seemed the most interesting option, so I
hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the resurrection
potion, I suspect its effects will be permanent."</p>
<p>"What does it do?" said Moody.</p>
<p>"It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to
anyone who has not used it," drawled Snape, "and I have not used
it."</p>
<p>Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. "What
about that one?"</p>
<p>"Love potion."</p>
<p><i>"Love potion?</i>" said Moody.</p>
<p>"Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond
with an unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the
Headmaster hopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly
loved each other."</p>
<p>"<i>Gah!</i>" said Moody. "That bloody sentimental fool -"</p>
<p>"Agreed," Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on
his work.</p>
<p>"Tell me you've at least got some Malaclaw venom in there."</p>
<p>"Second flask."</p>
<p>"Iocane powder."</p>
<p>"Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle."</p>
<p>"Bahl's Stupefaction," Moody said, naming an extremely addictive
narcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin
tendencies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to
ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact
portkey, instead of just having someone toss the target a trapped
Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work,
the addict had gone to the <i>further</i> effort to lay a <i>second
Portus,</i> on the <i>same portkey,</i> which had, on a second
touch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even
taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine what could
have possibly been going through the man's mind at the time he had
cast the second Portus.</p>
<p>"Tenth vial," said Snape.</p>
<p>"Basilisk venom," offered Moody.</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" spat Snape. "Snake venom is a positive component
of the resurrection potion! Not to mention that it would dissolve
the bone and all the other substances! And where would <i>we</i>
even get -"</p>
<p>"Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be
trusted."</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning,
surveying the graveyard, and the Potions Master continued
pouring.</p>
<p>"Hold on," Moody said suddenly. "How do you know <i>this</i> is
really where -"</p>
<p>"Because it says 'Tom Riddle' on the easily moved headstone,"
Snape said dryly. "And I have just won ten Sickles from the
Headmaster, who bet you would think of that before the fifth
bottle. So much for constant vigilance."</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>"How long did it take Albus to reali-"</p>
<p>"Three years after we learned of the ritual," said Snape, in a
tone not quite like his usual sardonic drawl. "In retrospect, we
should have consulted you earlier."</p>
<p>Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.</p>
<p>"We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting
substances," remarked the former Death Eater. "It <i>is</i>
possible that we are in the correct graveyard. He may not have
planned this far ahead back when he was slaughtering his family,
and he cannot move the grave itself -"</p>
<p>"The true location doesn't look like a graveyard any more,"
Moody said flatly. "He moved all the <i>other</i> graves here and
Memory-Charmed the Muggles. Not even Bellatrix Black would be told
anything about that until just before the ritual started. <i>No
one</i> knows the true location now except him."</p>
<p>They continued their futile work.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:</i></p>
<p>The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely
described as a remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through
the portrait hole you would see that the left half of the room was
Definitely Not Talking to the right half and vice versa. It was
very clear, it did not need to be explained to anyone, that you did
<i>not</i> have the option of <i>not taking sides</i>.</p>
<p>At a table in the exact middle of the room, Blaise Zabini sat by
himself, smirking as he did his homework. He had a reputation now,
and meant to keep it.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis:</i></p>
<p>"You doing anything interesting today?" said Tracey.</p>
<p>"Nope," said Daphne.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Aftermath, Harry Potter:</i></p>
<p>If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other
people around, just corridors and windows and staircases and the
occasional portrait, and now and then some interesting sight, such
as a bronze statue of a furry creature like a small child, holding
a peculiar flat spear...</p>
<p>If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other
people around, which suited Harry.</p>
<p>There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. In
fact you probably couldn't think of anywhere <i>better</i> to be
trapped than an ancient castle with a fractal ever-changing
structure that meant you couldn't ever run out of places to
explore, full of interesting people and interesting books and
incredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.</p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been told that he <i>couldn't</i> leave, he
probably would've <i>jumped</i> at the chance to spend more time in
Hogwarts, he would've plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts was
literally <i>optimal,</i> not in all the realms of possibility
maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it was the Maximum
Fun Location.</p>
<p>How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so
much more confining, how could the rest of the world become so much
more interesting and important, the instant Harry had been told
that he wasn't allowed to leave? He'd spent <i>months</i> here and
hadn't felt claustrophobic <i>then.</i></p>
<p><i>You</i> know <i>the research on this,</i> observed some part
of himself, <i>it's just standard scarcity effects, like that time
where as soon as a county outlawed phosphate detergents, people
who'd never cared before drove to the next county in order to buy
huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys showed that they
rated phosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and even
easier-pouring... and if you give two-year-olds a choice between a
toy in the open and one protected by a barrier they can go around,
they'll ignore the toy in the open and go for the one behind the
barrier... salespeople know that they can sell things just by
telling the customer it might not be available... it was all in
Cialdini's book</i> Influence, <i>everything you're feeling right
now, the grass is always greener on the side that's not
allowed.</i></p>
<p>If Harry hadn't been told that he couldn't leave, he probably
would've <i>jumped</i> at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the
summer...</p>
<p>...but not the rest of his life.</p>
<p>That was sort of the problem, really.</p>
<p>Who knew whether there <i>was</i> still a Dark Lord Voldemort
for him to defeat?</p>
<p>Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside
of the imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy
old wizard?</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort's body had been found burned to a crisp, there
couldn't really be such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort
still be alive? How did Dumbledore <i>know</i> that he was
alive?</p>
<p>And if there wasn't a Dark Lord, Harry couldn't defeat him, and
he would be trapped in Hogwarts forever.</p>
<p>...maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he
graduated his seventh year, six years and four months and three
weeks from now. It wasn't <i>that</i> long as lengths of time went,
it only <i>seemed</i> like long enough for protons to decay.</p>
<p>Only it wasn't <i>just</i> that.</p>
<p>It wasn't <i>just</i> Harry's freedom that was at stake.</p>
<p>The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot,
the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards,
was quietly sounding the alarm.</p>
<p>A <i>false</i> alarm.</p>
<p>A false alarm which <i>Harry</i> had triggered.</p>
<p><i>You know,</i> said the part of him that refined his skills,
<i>didn't you sort of ponder, once, how every different profession
has a different way to be excellent, how an excellent teacher isn't
like an excellent plumber; but they all have in common certain
methods of not being stupid; and that one of the most important
such techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they
turn into BIG mistakes?</i></p>
<p>...although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake,
actually...</p>
<p><i>The point being,</i> said his inner monitor, <i>it's getting
worse literally by the minute. The way spies turn people is, they
get them to commit a little sin, and then they use the little sin
to blackmail them into a bigger sin, and then they use THAT sin to
make them do even bigger things and then the blackmailer owns their
soul.</i></p>
<p><i>Didn't you once think about how the person being blackmailed,
if they could foresee the whole path, would just decide to take the
punch on the first step, take the hit of exposing that first sin?
Didn't you decide that you would do that, if anyone ever tried to
blackmail you into doing something major in order to conceal
something little? Do you see the similarity here, Harry James
Potter-Evans-Verres?</i></p>
<p>Only it wasn't little, it already wasn't little, there would be
a lot of very powerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just
for the false alarm but for <i>freeing Bellatrix from Azkaban,</i>
if the Dark Lord <i>did</i> exist and did come after him later,
that war might already be lost -</p>
<p><i>You don't think they'll be impressed by your honesty and
rationality and foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even
further?</i></p>
<p>Harry did <i>not</i>, in fact, think this; and after a moment's
reflection, whichever part of himself he was talking to, had to
agree that this was absurdly optimistic.</p>
<p>His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry went
over, and leaned his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the
grounds of Hogwarts from high above.</p>
<p>Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass,
ice-colored ice that was frozen creeks and frozen streams...
whichever school official had dubbed it 'The Forbidden Forest'
really hadn't understood marketing, the name just made you want to
go there even more. The sun was sinking in the sky, for Harry had
been thinking for some hours now, thinking mostly the same thoughts
over and over, but with key differences each time, like his
thoughts were not going in circles, but climbing a spiral, or
descending it.</p>
<p>He still couldn't believe that he'd gone through the
<i>entire</i> thing with Azkaban - he'd switched off his Patronus
before it took all his life, he'd stunned an Auror, he'd figured
out how to hide Bella from the Dementors, he'd faced down twelve
Dementors and scared them away, he'd invented the rocket-assisted
broomstick, and ridden it - he'd gone through the <i>entire</i>
thing without ever <i>once</i> rallying himself by thinking, <i>I
have to do this... because... I promised Hermione I'd come back
from lunch!</i> It felt like an irrevocably missed opportunity;
like, having done it wrong <i>that</i> time, he would never be able
to get it <i>right</i> no matter what sort of challenge he faced
next time, or what promise he made. Because then he would just be
doing it awkwardly and deliberately to make up for having missed it
the <i>first</i> time around, instead of making the heroic
declarations he could've made if he'd remembered his promise to
Hermione. Like that one wrong turn was irrevocable, you only got
one chance, had to do it right on the first try...</p>
<p>He should've remembered that promise to Hermione <i>before</i>
going to Azkaban.</p>
<p>Why had he decided to do that, again?</p>
<p><i>My working hypothesis is that you're stupid,</i> said
Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><i>That is not a useful fault analysis,</i> thought Harry.</p>
<p><i>If you want a little more detail,</i> said Hufflepuff, <i>the
Defense Professor of Hogwarts was all like 'Let's get Bellatrix
Black out of Azkaban!' and you were like 'Okay!'</i></p>
<p><i>Hold on, THAT'S not fair -</i></p>
<p><i>Hey,</i> said Hufflepuff, <i>notice how, once you're all the
way up here, and the individual trees sort of blur together, you
can actually see the shape of the forest?</i></p>
<p>Why <i>had</i> he done it...?</p>
<p>Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure.
He'd been too embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start
calculating expected utilities, he'd worried that Professor
Quirrell would stop respecting him if he said no or even hesitated
too much to help a maiden in distress.</p>
<p>He'd thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysterious
teacher offered you the first mission, the first chance, the call
to adventure, and you said <i>no</i>, then your mysterious teacher
walked away from you in disgust, and you never got another chance
to be a hero...</p>
<p>...yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He'd
gone and started thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot
twist, as opposed to, oh, say, here was a proposal to <i>break
Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban.</i> That had been the true and
original reason for the decision in the split second where it had
been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where
he said 'no' as dissonant. And when you thought about it, that
wasn't a rational way to make decisions. Professor Quirrell's
ulterior motive to obtain the last remains of Slytherin's lost
lore, before Bellatrix died and it was irrevocably forgotten,
seemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with
what had appeared at the time as a small risk.</p>
<p>It didn't seem fair, it didn't seem <i>fair</i>, that
<i>this</i> was what happened if he lost his grip on his
rationality for just a tiny fraction of a second, the tiny fraction
of a second required for his brain to decide to be more comfortable
with 'yes' arguments than 'no' arguments during the discussion that
had followed.</p>
<p>From high above, far enough above that the individual trees
blurred together, Harry stared out at the forest.</p>
<p>Harry <i>didn't</i> want to confess and ruin his reputation
forever and get everyone angry at him and maybe end up killed by
the Dark Lord later. He'd rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six
years than face that. That was how he felt. And so it was in fact
helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single decisive factor,
which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell would go to
Azkaban and die there.</p>
<p>(A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry's breathing.)</p>
<p>If you phrased it <i>that</i> way... why, you could even pretend
to be a hero, instead of a coward.</p>
<p>Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at
the clear blue forbidden sky.</p>
<p>Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the
fluffy things, the mysterious endless blue in which they were
embedded, that strange new unknown place.</p>
<p>It... actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that
his own troubles were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That
there were people in the world who were <i>really</i> in trouble
and Harry Potter was not one of them.</p>
<p>What was he going to do about Azkaban?</p>
<p>What was he going to do about magical Britain?</p>
<p>...which side was he on, now?</p>
<p>In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had
said certainly <i>sounded</i> a lot wiser than Professor Quirrell.
Better and brighter, more moral, more <i>convenient,</i> wouldn't
it be nice if it were true. And the thing to remember was that
Dumbledore believed things <i>because</i> they sounded nice, but
Professor Quirrell was the one who was <i>sane</i>.</p>
<p>(Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he
thought of Professor Quirrell.)</p>
<p>But just because something sounded nice, didn't make it
<i>wrong,</i> either.</p>
<p>And if the Defense Professor <i>did</i> have a flaw in his
sanity, it was that his outlook on life was <i>too
negative.</i></p>
<p><i>Really?</i> inquired the part of Harry that had read eighteen
million experimental results about people being too optimistic and
overconfident. <i>Professor Quirrell is too pessimistic? So
pessimistic that his expectations routinely</i> undershoot
<i>reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he's unique. Which
one of you two planned the perfect crime, and</i> then <i>put in
all the error margin and fallbacks that ended up saving your
butt,</i> just in case <i>the perfect crime went wrong? Hint hint,
his name wasn't Harry Potter.</i></p>
<p>But "pessimistic" wasn't the correct word to describe Professor
Quirrell's problem - if a problem it truly was, and not the
superior wisdom of experience. But to Harry it looked like
Professor Quirrell was constantly interpreting everything in the
worst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass that
was 90% full, he'd tell you that the 10% empty part proved that no
one <i>really</i> cared about water.</p>
<p>That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it.
Not all of magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well
over half full...</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.</p>
<p>...although, <i>following</i> the analogy, if Azkaban existed,
then maybe it <i>did</i> prove that the 90% good part was there for
other reasons, people trying to <i>make a show of kindness</i> as
Professor Quirrell had put it. For if they were truly kind they
would not have made Azkaban, they would storm the fortress to tear
it down... wouldn't they?</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a
rationalist you had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in
human nature, and some of those flaws were innocent logical
failures, and some of them looked a lot darker.</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the
Milgram experiment.</p>
<p>Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World
War II, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed
Hitler.</p>
<p>So he had designed an experiment to investigate
<i>obedience,</i> to see if Germans were, for some reason, more
liable to obey harmful orders from authority figures.</p>
<p>First he'd run a pilot version of his experiment on American
subjects, as a control.</p>
<p>And afterward he hadn't bothered trying it in Germany.</p>
<p>Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a
horizontal line, with labels starting at '15 volts' and going up to
'450 volts', with labels for each group of four switches. The first
group of four labeled 'Slight Shock', the sixth group labeled
'Extreme Intensity Shock', the seventh group labeled 'Danger:
Severe Shock', and the two last switches left over labeled just
'XXX'.</p>
<p>And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had
appeared to the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone
who had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on
learning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped
into a chair, along with the electrodes. The true experimental
subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just so
that they could see that it worked.</p>
<p>The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the
effects of punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the
test was to see if it made a difference what sort of person
administered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the
chair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that each time
the 'learner' got one wrong, the 'teacher' was to administer a
successively stronger shock.</p>
<p>At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out
answers and begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter
would instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers
and continue.</p>
<p>At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be
repeated.</p>
<p>After that nothing would be heard.</p>
<p>If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the
experimenter, maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a
gray lab coat, would say 'Please continue', then 'The experiment
requires that you continue', then 'It is absolutely essential that
you continue', then 'You have no other choice, you <i>must</i> go
on'. If the fourth prod still didn't work, the experiment halted
there.</p>
<p>Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the
experimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what
percentage of subjects <i>they</i> thought would go all the way up
to the 450-volt level, what percentage of subjects would press the
last of the two switches marked XXX, after the victim had stopped
responding.</p>
<p>The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.</p>
<p>The actual number had been 26 out of 40.</p>
<p>The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously,
bitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at
the experimenter's prompting, they had, most of them, gone on
administering what they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly
lethal electrical shocks. All the way to the end.</p>
<p>Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the
Defense Professor's voice saying something along the lines of:
<i>Why, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men
would betray their most cherished principles for money and power,
but I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.</i></p>
<p>It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if
you weren't a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when
Harry had read about the Milgram experiment, the thought had
occurred to him that situations like this had probably arisen many
times in the ancestral environment, and that most potential
ancestors who'd tried to disobey Authority were dead. Or that they
had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient.
People <i>thought</i> themselves good and moral, but when push came
to shove, some switch flipped in their brain, and it was suddenly a
lot harder to heroically defy Authority than they thought. Even if
you could do it, it wouldn't be easy, it wouldn't be some
effortless display of heroism. You would tremble, your voice would
break, you would be afraid; would you be able to defy Authority
even then?</p>
<p>Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the
connection between Milgram's experiment and what Hermione had done
on her first day of Defense class, she'd refused to shoot a fellow
student, even when Authority had told her that she must, she had
trembled and been afraid but she had still refused. Harry had seen
that happen right in front of his own eyes and he still hadn't made
the connection until now...</p>
<p>Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinking
lower, the sky fading, darkening, even if most of it was still
blue, soon it would turn to night. The gold and red colors of Sun
and sunset reminded him of Fawkes; and Harry wondered, for a
moment, if it must be a sad thing to be a phoenix, and call and cry
and scream without being heeded.</p>
<p>But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he
would always be reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire,
and despairing over Azkaban belonged to the darkness just as much
as did Azkaban itself.</p>
<p>If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that
was the way reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you
still had a choice of how to <i>feel</i> about it, whether you
would despair over the empty half or rejoice in the water that was
there.</p>
<p>Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only
needed to call out the test words to the victim strapped into the
chair, and record the answers, while someone <i>else</i> pressed
the switches. It was the same apparent suffering, the same frantic
pounding followed by silence; but it wasn't <i>you</i> pressing the
switch. <i>You</i> just watched it happen, and read the questions
to the person being tortured.</p>
<p>37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that
experiment to the end, the 450-volt end marked 'XXX'.</p>
<p>And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to
feel cynical about that.</p>
<p>But 3 out of 40 subjects had <i>refused</i> to participate all
the way to the end.</p>
<p>The Hermiones.</p>
<p>They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn't fire a
Simple Strike Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor
ordered them to do it. The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews
and homosexuals in their attics during the Holocaust, and sometimes
lost their lives for it.</p>
<p>And were those people from some other species than humanity? Did
they have some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of
neural circuitry, which lesser mortals did not possess? But that
was not likely, given the logic of sexual reproduction which said
that the genes for complex machinery would be scrambled beyond
repair, if they were not universal.</p>
<p>Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same
parts inside them somewhere...</p>
<p>...well, that was a nice thought but it wasn't <i>strictly</i>
true, there was such a thing as literal brain damage, people could
<i>lose</i> genes and the complex machine could stop working, there
were sociopaths and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear to
care. Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like that, or maybe he had
known good and yet still chosen evil; at this point it didn't
matter in the slightest. But a <i>supermajority</i> of the
population ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and
Holocaust resisters did.</p>
<p>The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who
had trembled and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the
way to pressing the switches marked 'XXX', many of them had written
to thank Milgram, afterward, for what they had learned about
themselves. That, too, was part of the story, the legend of that
legendary experiment.</p>
<p>The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tip
peeking above the faraway tops of trees.</p>
<p>Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed
to be proof against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at
it without damaging his eyes.</p>
<p>Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light
that was not obscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3
parts out of 40, the other 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5%
of the glass that was full, which proved that people really did
care about water, even if that force of caring within themselves
was too often defeated. If people truly didn't care, the glass
would have been truly empty. If everyone had been like You-Know-Who
inside, secretly cleverly selfish, there would have been no
resisters to the Holocaust at all.</p>
<p>Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his
life, and knew that he had switched sides.</p>
<p>Because he couldn't believe in it any more, he couldn't really,
not after going to Azkaban. He couldn't do what 37 out of 40 people
would vote for him to do. Everyone might have inside them what it
took to be Hermione, and someday they might learn; but
<i>someday</i> wasn't <i>now</i>, not here, not today, not in the
real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then you
weren't a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had been
right, Harry would not bow his head in submission when that
happened.</p>
<p>There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn't
go to Azkaban and come back having not changed your mind about
anything important.</p>
<p><i>So is Professor Quirrell right, then?</i> asked Slytherin.
<i>Leaving out whether he's good or evil, is he</i> right? <i>Are
you, to them, whether they know it or not, their next Lord? We'll
just leave out the Dark part, that's him being cynical again. But
is it your intention now to rule? I've got to say, that makes
even</i> me <i>nervous.</i></p>
<p><i>Do you think you can be trusted with power?</i> said
Gryffindor. <i>Isn't there some sort of rule that people who want
power shouldn't have it? Maybe we should make Hermione the ruler
instead.<br /></i></p>
<p><i>Do you think you're fit to run a society and not have it
collapse into total chaos inside of three weeks flat?</i> said
Hufflepuff. <i>Imagine how loudly Mum would scream if she'd heard
you'd been elected Prime Minister, now ask yourself, are you sure
she's wrong about that?</i></p>
<p><i>Actually,</i> said Ravenclaw, <i>I have to point out that all
this political stuff sounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if we
leave all the electioneering to Draco and stick to science? It's
what we're actually good at, and that's been known to improve the
human condition too, y'know.</i></p>
<p><i>Slow down,</i> thought Harry at his components, <i>we don't
have to decide everything right now. We're allowed to ponder the
problem as fully as possible before coming to a solution.</i></p>
<p>The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.</p>
<p>It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were,
which side you were on, of having <i>not already made up your
mind</i> about something as major as that, there was an unfamiliar
sensation of freedom in it...</p>
<p>And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his
last question, which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made
it hard once more to breathe, started that burning sensation in
Harry's throat, sent his thoughts around that loop of the climbing
spiral once again.</p>
<p>Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor
Quirrell? Harry was used to knowing himself, and he didn't know why
he felt so sad...</p>
<p>It felt like he'd lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in
Azkaban, that was how it felt. As surely as if the Defense
Professor had been eaten by Dementors, consumed in the empty
voids.</p>
<p><i>Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra
and there was in fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn't
see it for a couple of hours? Why can't things go back to the way
they were?</i></p>
<p>But then it hadn't <i>been</i> the Avada Kedavra. That might
have played a part in irreversibly collapsing a structure of
rationalizations and flinches and carefully not thinking about
certain things. But it hadn't been the Avada Kedavra, that hadn't
been the disturbing thing that Harry had seen.</p>
<p><i>What did I see...?</i></p>
<p>Harry looked at the fading sky.</p>
<p>He'd seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while
facing the Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been
effortless, and complete.</p>
<p>Another woman had known the Defense Professor as 'Jeremy
Jaffe'.</p>
<p><i>How many different people are you, anyway?</i></p>
<p><i>I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.</i></p>
<p>You couldn't help but wonder...</p>
<p>...whether 'Professor Quirrell' was just one more name on the
list, just one more person that had been <i>turned into</i>, made
up in the service of some unguessable goal.</p>
<p>Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to
Professor Quirrell, if it was a mask, and what motive was behind
that mask. With every dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what
was pulling the levers on the lips.</p>
<p><i>Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get
too Slytherin? If I pull off too many plots, will I never be able
to smile at anyone again, without them wondering what I really mean
by it?</i></p>
<p>Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface
appearances and make a normal human relationship possible again,
but Harry couldn't think of what it might be.</p>
<p>That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person,
but the... connection...</p>
<p>Why did that hurt so much?</p>
<p>Why did it feel so lonely, now?</p>
<p>Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust
and befriend? Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione,
Draco, not to mention Mum and Dad, it wasn't like Harry was
<i>alone...</i></p>
<p>Only...</p>
<p>A choking sensation grew in Harry's throat as he understood.</p>
<p>Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco,
they all of them sometimes knew things that Harry didn't,
but...</p>
<p>They did not excel above Harry <i>within</i> his own sphere of
power; such genius as they possessed was not like his genius, and
his genius was not like theirs; he might look upon them as peers,
but not look <i>up</i> to them as his <i>superiors.</i></p>
<p>None of them had been, none of them could ever be...</p>
<p>Harry's mentor...</p>
<p>That was who Professor Quirrell had been.</p>
<p>That was who Harry had lost.</p>
<p>And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or
might not allow Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would
know all Professor Quirrell's hidden purposes and the doubts
between them would go away; but even if that seemed possible, it
didn't seem very probable.</p>
<p>There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty
trees, rippled the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a
whispering sound as it slid past the window that looked upon the
half-twilit world, and Harry's thoughts wandered outward for a
time.</p>
<p>Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.</p>
<p><i>Why am I different from the other children my age?</i></p>
<p>If Professor Quirrell's answer to that had been an evasion, then
it was a very well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough,
sufficiently full of suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a
trap for a Ravenclaw who couldn't be diverted by less. Or maybe
Professor Quirrell had meant his answer honestly. Who knew what
motive might have pulled that lever on those lips?</p>
<p><i>I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an
Occlumens, and I think you will become a perfect Occlumens before
long. Identity does not mean, to such as us, what it means to other
people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and the true difference
about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good
imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be
larger than them in order to enact them within his mind. To an
actor or spy or politician, the limit of his own diameter is the
limit of who he can pretend to be, the limit of which face he may
wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine,
we can</i> be, <i>in reality and not pretense.</i> <i>While you
imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter, you</i> were <i>a child. Yet
there are other existences you could support, larger existences, if
you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in your
circumference, when other children your age are small and
constrained? Why can you imagine and</i> become <i>selves more
adult than a mere child of a playwright should be able to compose?
That I do not know, and I must not say what I guess. But what you
have, Mr. Potter, is freedom.</i></p>
<p>If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.</p>
<p>And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrell
hadn't <i>realized</i> how disturbed Harry would be, how
<i>wrong</i> that speech would sound to him, how much damage it
would do to his trust in Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>There ought to always be one real person who you <i>truly</i>
were, at the center of everything...</p>
<p>Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering
darkness.</p>
<p>...right?</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes
of breath and looked up from her copy of <i>Beauxbatons: A
History</i> to see the missing boy, the boy who had been misplaced
at lunch that Sunday, whose dinner nonappearance had been
accompanied by rumors - and she hadn't believed them because they
were <i>completely ridiculous</i>, but she'd felt a little
queasiness inside - that he'd withdrawn from Hogwarts in order to
hunt down Bellatrix Black.</p>
<p>"<i>Harry!</i>" she shrieked, she didn't even realize that she
was talking directly to him for the first time in a week, or notice
how some other students started at the sound of her yelling all the
way across the Ravenclaw common room.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking
toward her, so she stopped halfway out of her chair -</p>
<p>A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he
was putting away his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around
them.</p>
<p>(And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like
they were watching.)</p>
<p>"Hey," Harry said. His voice wavered. "I missed you. You're...
going to talk to me again, now?"</p>
<p>Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn't think of what to
say. She'd missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty
sort of feeling, that it might've been a lot worse for him. She had
other friends, Harry... it didn't feel <i>fair</i>, sometimes, that
Harry talked to only her like that, so that she <i>had</i> to talk
to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair things had been
happening to <i>him</i>, too.</p>
<p>"What's been going <i>on?</i>" she said. "There's all sorts of
rumors. There were people saying you'd run off to fight Bellatrix
Black, there were people saying you'd run off to <i>join</i>
Bellatrix Black -" and <i>those</i> rumors had said that Hermione
had just made up the thing about the phoenix, and she'd yelled that
the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so then the next rumor
had claimed she'd made up <i>that</i> part too, which was stupidity
of such an inconceivable level that it left her <i>completely
flabbergasted.</i></p>
<p>"I can't talk about it," Harry said in a bare whisper. "Can't
talk about a lot of it. I wish I could tell you everything," his
voice wavered, "but I can't... I guess, if it helps or anything,
I'm not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell any more..."</p>
<p>Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.</p>
<p>Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.</p>
<p>"Are you crying?" said Hermione.</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. "I
don't want anyone else to see."</p>
<p>There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she
didn't know what to do about a boy crying, and she didn't know what
was happening; she felt like huge things were happening around her
- no, around Harry - and if she knew what they were she would
probably be scared, or alarmed, or something, but she didn't know
anything.</p>
<p>"Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?" she said at
last.</p>
<p>"That's not why I can't go to lunch with him any more," Harry
said, still in that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his
eyes. "That was the Headmaster's decision. But yeah, Professor
Quirrell said some things to me that made me trust him less, I
guess..." Harry's voice sounded very shaky. "I'm feeling kind of
alone right now."</p>
<p>Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched her
yesterday. She'd kept thinking about that touch, over and over,
maybe because she <i>wanted</i> it to be important, to mean
something to her...</p>
<p>"Is there any way I can help?" she said.</p>
<p>"I want to do something normal," Harry said from behind his
hands. "Something very normal for first-year Hogwarts students.
Something eleven-year-olds and twelve-year-olds like us are
<i>supposed</i> to do. Like play a game of Exploding Snap or
something... I don't suppose you have the cards or know the rules
or anything like that?"</p>
<p>"Um... I <i>don't</i> know the rules, actually..." said
Hermione. "I know they <i>explode</i>."</p>
<p>"I don't suppose Gobstones?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"Don't know the rules and they <i>spit</i> at you. Those are
<i>boy</i> games, Harry!"</p>
<p>There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to
wipe it, and then took his hands away; and then he was looking at
her, looking a little helpless. "Well," Harry said, "what <i>do</i>
wizards and witches our age do, when they play, you know, the kind
of pointless silly games we're <i>supposed</i> to play at this
age?"</p>
<p>"Hopscotch?" said Hermione. "Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? <i>I</i>
don't know, <i>I</i> read books!"</p>
<p>Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along with
him even though she didn't know quite why, but it <i>was</i>
funny.</p>
<p>"I guess that helped a little," said Harry. "Actually I think it
helped more than playing Gobstones for an hour could've possibly
helped, so thanks for being you. And no matter what, I'm <i>not</i>
having anyone Obliviate everything I know about calculus. I'd
sooner die."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>" said Hermione. "Why - why would you <i>ever</i>
want to do <i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored
background noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. "I'm a tad
sleepy so I'm going off to bed," Harry said, now his voice was
ordinary and wry, "I've got some lost time to make up for, but I'll
see you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if that's all right.
Not to mention it wouldn't be fair to dump all my depression on
you. G'night, Hermione."</p>
<p>"Good night, Harry," she said, feeling very confused and
alarmed. "Pleasant dreams."</p>
<p>Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued
on toward the stairs that led to the first-year-boys' dorms.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>Harry turned the Quieting Charm all the way up, on the head of
his bedboard, so that he wouldn't wake anyone else up if he
screamed.</p>
<p>Set his alarm to wake him up for breakfast (if he wasn't up
already by that hour, if indeed he slept at all).</p>
<p>Got into bed, laid down -</p>
<p>- felt the lump beneath his pillow.</p>
<p>Harry stared up at the canopy above his bed.</p>
<p>Hissed under his breath, "Oh, you've got to be kidding
me..."</p>
<p>It took a few seconds before Harry could muster the heart to sit
up in bed, pull the blanket over himself and his pillow to obscure
the deed from the other boys, cast a low-intensity <i>Lumos</i> and
see what was under his pillow.</p>
<p>There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.</p>
<p>The parchment read,</p>
<p><i>A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of
your cage.</i></p>
<p><i>I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a
point. Bellatrix Black is loosed upon the world once more, and that
is not good news for any good person. If I stood in Dumbledore's
place, I might well do the same.</i></p>
<p><i>But just in case... The Salem Witches' Institute in America
accepts boys as well, despite the name. They are good people and
would protect you even from Dumbledore, if you needed it. Britain
holds that you need Dumbledore's permission to emigrate to magical
America, but magical America disagrees. So in the final extremity,
get outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in half the King of
Hearts from this deck of cards.</i></p>
<p><i>That you should resort to it only in the final extremity goes
without saying.</i></p>
<p><i>Be well, Harry Potter.</i></p>
<p><i>- Santa Claus</i></p>
<p>Harry stared down at the pack of cards.</p>
<p>It <i>couldn't</i> take him anywhere else, not right now,
portkeys didn't work here.</p>
<p>But he still felt unnerved about the prospect of picking it up,
even to hide it inside his trunk...</p>
<p>Well, he'd <i>already</i> picked up the parchment, which could
just as easily have been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was
involved.</p>
<p>But still.</p>
<p>"Wingardium Leviosa," Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet of
cards to lie next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of
the headboard. He'd deal with it tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream
without any phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p>He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he'd yet to
scream this night, but his blanket was all tangled around him from
where his sleeping form had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying
to get away from the gaps in space that were pursuing him through a
corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, an endlessly long corridor
of metal lit by dim gaslight, and he hadn't <i>known</i>, in the
dream, that touching those voids meant he would die horribly and
leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he'd known was
that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in the world
sliding after him -</p>
<p>Harry started to cry again, it wasn't for the horror of the
chase, it was that he'd run away while someone behind him was
screaming for help, screaming for him to come back and save her,
help her, she was being eaten, she was going to die, and in the
dream Harry had run away instead of helping her.</p>
<p><i>"DON'T GO!" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal
door. "No, no, no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't
-"</i></p>
<p>Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He'd walked away.
Fawkes should hate him.</p>
<p>Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. <i>He'd</i> walked away.</p>
<p>Fawkes should hate everyone -</p>
<p>The boy wasn't awake, wasn't dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled
and confused in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking,
unprotected by the safety rails that his aware mind imposed on
itself, the careful rules and censors. In that shadowland his brain
had woken up enough to think, but something else was too sleepy to
act; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained by his
self-concept, his waking self's ideals of what he shouldn't think.
That was the freedom of his brain's dreams, as his self-concept
slept. Free to repeat, over and over, Harry's new worst
nightmare:</p>
<p><i>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</i></p>
<p><i>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</i></p>
<p><i>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</i></p>
<p>A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot
wrath / icy cold hatred, for the world which had done that to her /
for himself, and in his half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes,
fantasized ways out of the moral dilemma, he imagined himself
hovering above the vast triangular horror of Azkaban, and
whispering an incantation unlike any syllables that had ever been
heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across the
sky and were heard on the other side of the world, and there was a
blast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore
apart all the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal
walls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim
orange lights, and then a moment later his brain remembered that
there were people in there, and rewrote the half-dream fantasy to
show all the prisoners laughing as they flew away in flocks from
the burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver light restoring the flesh
to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started crying harder into
his pillow, because he couldn't do it, because he wasn't God -</p>
<p>He'd sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist,
he'd sworn by all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he'd
given his oath so now he had to do something, <i>had to do
something, had to DO SOMETHING -</i></p>
<p>Maybe it was pointless.</p>
<p>Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.</p>
<p>Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.</p>
<p>And in fact he'd sworn he'd do it, so now that was what he had
to do.</p>
<p>He'd just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was
all. If that meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a
spell to whisper that would echo all across the sky, whatever, the
important thing was to destroy Azkaban.</p>
<p>That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it
was done.</p>
<p>His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details before
accepting that as an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt
like enough of a resolution to let his tired mind fall truly asleep
again, and dream the next nightmare.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><i>Final Aftermath:</i></p>
<p>She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her
breathing that left her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs
didn't move, she woke up with an unvoiced scream on her lips and no
words, no words came forth, for she could not understand what she
had seen, <i>she could not understand what she had seen</i>, it was
too large for her to encompass and still taking shape, she could
not put words to that formless shape and so she could not discharge
it, could not discharge it and become innocent and unknowing once
more.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" she whispered.</p>
<p>Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and
expensive alarm clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift
upon her employment at Hogwarts, whispered back, "Around two in the
morning. Go back to sleep."</p>
<p>Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in
sweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself
up before she tried to go back to sleep, she tried to go back to
sleep and eventually succeeded.</p>
<p>Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">LORD OF THE RATIONALITY</p>
<p>Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him.
All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A
great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of
some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after
all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at
peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last
with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if
some other will was using his small voice.</p>
<p>"We cannot," said Frodo. "We must not. Do you not see? It is
exactly what the Enemy desires. All of this he has foreseen."</p>
<p>The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the
Elves; sternness in the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of
Elrond and of Gandalf that Frodo almost could not withstand it. It
was very hard, then, not to grasp the Ring in his hand, and harder
still not to put it on, to face them as only Frodo.</p>
<p>"Do you not question it?" Frodo said, thin like the wind his
voice, and wavering like a breeze. "You have chosen, of all things,
to send the Ring into Mordor; should you not wonder? How did it
come to this? That we might, of all our choices, do that single
thing our Enemy most desires? Perhaps the Cracks of Doom are
already guarded, strongly enough to hold off Gandalf and Elrond and
Glorfindel all together; or perhaps the Master of that place has
cooled the lava there, set it to trap the Ring so that he may
simply bring it out after it is thrown in..." A memory of awful
clarity came over Frodo then, and a flash of black laughter, and
the thought came to him that it was <i>just</i> what the Enemy
would do. Only the thought came to him so: <i>thus it would amuse
me to do, if I meant to rule...</i></p>
<p>There were doubtful glances exchanged within the council; Glóin
and Gimli and Boromir were now looking at the Elves more
skeptically than before, like they had awoken out of a dream of
words.</p>
<p>"The Enemy is very wise," said Gandalf, "and weighs all things
to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure that
he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts.
Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it,
that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it -"</p>
<p>"He <i>will</i> think of it!" cried Frodo. He struggled for
words, trying to convey things that had once seemed perfect in his
comprehension, and then faded like melting snow. "If the Enemy
thought that all his foes were moved by desire for power alone - he
would guess wrongly, over and over, and the Maker of this Ring
would <i>see</i> that, he would <i>know</i> that somewhere he had
made a mistake!" Frodo's hands stretched forth pleadingly.</p>
<p>Boromir stirred, and his voice was doubtful. "You speak fair of
the Enemy," said Boromir, "for one of his foes."</p>
<p>Frodo's mouth opened and shut in desperate bewilderment; for
Frodo knew, he knew the Man was mad, but he could think of nothing
to say.</p>
<p>Then Bilbo spoke, and his withered voice silenced the whole
room, even Elrond who had been about to speak. "Frodo is right, I
fear," whispered the old hobbit. "I remember, I remember what it
was like. To see with the Black Sight. I remember. The Enemy will
think that we might not trust one another, that the weaker among us
will propose to destroy the Ring so that the stronger may not have
it. He knows that even one not truly good might still cry to
destroy the Ring, to make a show of pretended goodness. And the
Enemy will <i>not</i> think it impossible that such a decision be
made by this council, for you see, he does not trust us to be
wise." A whispering chuckle rose from the ancient hobbit's throat.
"And if he did - why, he would <i>still</i> guard the Cracks of
Doom. It would cost him little."</p>
<p>Now foreboding was on the faces even of the Elves, and the Wise;
Elrond had frowned, and the sharp eyebrows of Gandalf furrowed.</p>
<p>Frodo gazed at them all, feeling a wildness come over him, a
despair; and as his heart weakened a shadow came over his vision, a
darkness and a wavering. From within the shadow Frodo saw Gandalf,
and the wizard's strength was revealed as weakness, and his wisdom
folly. For Frodo knew, as the Ring seemed to drag and weigh on his
breast, that Gandalf had not thought at all of history and lore,
when the wizard spoke of how the Enemy would not understand any
desire save power; that Gandalf had not remembered how Sauron had
cast down and corrupted the Men of Númenor in the days of their
glory. Just as it had not occurred to Gandalf that the Enemy might
learn to comprehend foes of goodwill by <i>looking...</i></p>
<p>Frodo's gaze swung to Elrond, but there was no hope there, no
answer and no rescue in the shadowy vision; for Elrond had let
Isildur go, carrying the Ring from the Cracks of Doom where it
should have been destroyed, to the cost of all this war. Not for
Isildur's own sake, not for friendship had it been done, for the
Ring had killed Isildur in the end, and far worse fates could have
followed him. But the Doom that had stemmed from Isildur's deed
would have seemed unsure to Elrond then, unsure and distant in
time; and yet the cost to Elrond himself of taking his sword's
pommel to the back of Isildur's head would have been surer, and
nearer...</p>
<p>As though in desperation, Frodo turned to look at Aragorn, the
weathered man who had donned his travel-worn clothes for this
council, the heir of kings who spoke softly to hobbits. But Frodo's
vision seemed to double, and in the shadowy second image Frodo saw
a Man who had spent too much of his youth among Elves, who had
learned to wear humble and stained clothes amid the gold and
jewels, knowing he could not match them wisdom for wisdom, and
hoping to outplay them in a fashion they would not emulate...</p>
<p>In the sight of the Ring, which was the sight of the Ring's own
Maker, all noble things faded into stratagems and lies, a world of
grey and darkness without any light. They had not made their
choices knowingly, Gandalf or Elrond or Aragorn; the impulses had
come from the dark hidden parts of themselves, the black secret
depths which the Ring had rendered plain in Frodo's vision. Would
they outthink the Shadow, when they could not comprehend even their
own selves, or the forces that moved them?</p>
<p>"Frodo!" came the sharp whisper of Bilbo's voice, and Frodo came
to himself, and halted his hand reaching up toward where the Ring
lay on his breast, on its chain, dragging like a vast stone around
his neck.</p>
<p>Reaching up to grasp the Ring wherein all answers lay.</p>
<p>"How did you bear this thing?" Frodo whispered to Bilbo, as if
the two of them were the only souls in the room, though all the
Council watched them. "For years? I cannot imagine it."</p>
<p>"I kept it locked in a room to which only Gandalf had the key,"
said his uncle, "and when I began to imagine ways to open it, I
remembered Gollum."</p>
<p>A shudder went through Frodo, remembering the tales. The horror
of the Misty Mountains, thinking, always thinking in the dark;
ruling the goblins from the shadows and filling the tunnels with
traps; but for Bilbo wearing the ring that first time not a single
dwarf would have lived. And now, Legolas the Elf had told them,
Gollum had given up on sending his agents against the Shire, had at
last found the courage to leave his mountains and seek the Ring
himself. That was Gollum, the fate which Frodo would share himself,
if the Ring were not destroyed.</p>
<p>Only they had no way to destroy the Ring.</p>
<p>The Shadow had foreseen every move they could make. Had
<i>almost</i> - Frodo still could not imagine how it had been done,
how the Shadow had arranged such a thing - had <i>almost</i>
maneuvered the Council into sending the Ring straight into Mordor
with only a tiny guard set on it, as they would have done if Frodo
and Bilbo had not been there.</p>
<p>And having foregone that swiftest of all possible defeats, the
only question remaining was how long it would take to lose. Gandalf
had delayed too long, delayed far too long to set this march in
motion. It could have been so easy, if only Bilbo had set out
eighty years earlier, if only Bilbo had been told what Gandalf had
already suspected, if only Gandalf's heart had not silently
flinched away from the prospect of being embarrassingly
wrong...</p>
<p>Frodo's hand spasmed on his breast; without thought, his fingers
began to rise again toward the vast weight of the chain on which
the Ring hung.</p>
<p>All he had to do was put on the Ring.</p>
<p>Just that, and all would become clear to him, once more the
slowness and mud would leave his thoughts, all possibilities and
futures transparent to him, he would see through the Shadow's plans
and devise an irresistible counterstroke -</p>
<p>- and he would never be able to take off the Ring, not again,
not by any will that would be left to him. All Frodo had of those
moments were fading memories, but he knew that it had felt like
dying, to let all his towers of thought collapse and become only
Frodo once more. It had felt like dying, he remembered that much of
Weathertop even if he remembered little else. And if he did wear
the Ring again, it would be better to die with it on his finger, to
end his life while he was still himself; for Frodo knew that he
could not withstand the effects of wearing the Ring a second time,
not afterward when the limitless clarity was lost to him...</p>
<p>Frodo looked around the Council, at the poor lost leaderless
Wise, and he knew they could not defeat the Shadow by their own
strength.</p>
<p>"I will wear it one last time," Frodo said, his voice broken and
failing, as he had known from the beginning that he would say in
the end, "one last time to find the answer for this Council, and
then there will be other hobbits."</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" screamed the voice of Sam, as the other hobbit
began to rush forward from where he had hidden; even as Frodo, with
movement as swift and precise as a Nazgûl, took out the Ring from
beneath his shirt; and somehow Bilbo was already standing there and
had already thrust his finger through.</p>
<p>It all happened before even Gandalf's staff could point, before
Aragorn could level the hilt-shard of his sword; the Dwarves
shouted in shock, and the Elves were dismayed.</p>
<p>"Of course," said Bilbo's voice, as Frodo began to weep, "I see
it now, I understand everything at last. Listen, listen and
swiftly, here is what you must do -"</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE</p>
<p>With a critical eye, Peter looked over the encamped Centaurs
with their bows, Beavers with their long daggers, and talking Bears
with their chain-mail draped over them. He was in charge, because
he was one of the mythical Sons of Adam and had declared himself
High King of Narnia; but the truth was he didn't really know much
about encampments, weapons, and guard patrols. In the end all he
could see was that they all looked proud and confident, and Peter
had to hope they were right about that; because if you couldn't
believe in your own people, you couldn't believe in anyone.</p>
<p>"They'd scare <i>me</i>, if I had to fight 'em," Peter said
finally, "but I don't know if it's enough to beat...
<i>her.</i>"</p>
<p>"You don't suppose this mysterious lion will actually show up
and help us, d'you?" said Lucy. Her voice was very quiet, so that
none of the creatures around them would hear. "Only it'd be nice to
really have him, don't you think, instead of just letting people
think that he put us in charge?"</p>
<p>Susan shook her head, shaking the magical arrows in the quiver
on her back. "If there was really someone like that," Susan said,
"he wouldn't have let the White Witch cover the land in winter for
a hundred years, would he?"</p>
<p>"I had the strangest dream," Lucy said, her voice even quieter,
"where we didn't have to organize any creatures or convince them to
fight, we just walked into this place and the lion was already
here, with all the armies already mustered, and he went and rescued
Edmund, and then we rode alongside him into this tremendous battle
where he killed the White Witch..."</p>
<p>"Did the dream have a moral?" said Peter.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Lucy, blinking and looking a little
puzzled. "In the dream it all seemed pointless somehow."</p>
<p>"I think maybe the land of Narnia was trying to tell you," said
Susan, "or maybe it was just your own dreams trying to tell you,
that if there was really such a person as that lion, there'd be no
use for <i>us</i>."</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">MY LITTLE PONY: FRIENDSHIP IS
SCIENCE</p>
<p>"Applejack, who told me outright that I was mistaken, represents
the spirit of... <i>honesty!</i>" The dusky pony raised her head
even higher, her mane blowing like a wind about the night sky of
her long neck, her eyes blazing like stars. "Fluttershy, who
approached the manticore to find out about the thorn in its paw,
represents the spirit of... <i>investigation!</i> Pinkie Pie, who
realized that the awful faces were just trees, represents the
spirit of... <i>formulating alternative hypotheses!</i> Rarity, who
solved the serpent's problem represents the spirit of...
<i>creativity!</i> Rainbow Dash, who saw through the false offer of
her heart's desire, represents the spirit of... <i>analysis!</i>
Marie-Susan, who made us convince her of our theories before she
funded our expedition, represents the spirit of... <i>peer
review!</i> And when those Elements are ignited by the spark of
curiosity that resides in the heart of all of us, it creates the
seventh element - the Element of Sci-"</p>
<p>The blast of power that came forth was like a wind of brilliant
lava, it caught Marie-Susan before the pony could even flinch, and
stripped her flesh from her bones and crumbled her bones to ash
before any of them had the chance to rear in shock.</p>
<p>From the dark thing that stood in the center of the dais where
the Elements had shattered, from the seething madness and despair
surrounding the scarce-recognizable void-black outline of a horse,
came a voice that seemed to bypass all ears and burn like cold
fire, sounding directly in the brain of every pony who heard:</p>
<p><i>Did you expect me to just stand there and let you
finish?</i></p>
<p>The screams began, then, echoing around that ancient and
abandoned throne room; and Applejack fell to her forelocks beside
the still-glowing ash that was all that remained of Marie-Susan's
bones, looking too shattered even to sob.</p>
<p>Twilight Sparkle stared at the horror that had once been
Nightmare Moon, racking her brains with frantic desperation and
realizing that it was over, they were doomed, it was hopeless
without Marie-Susan; everyone knew that no matter how honest,
investigating, skeptical, creative, analytic, or curious you were,
what <i>really</i> made your work Science was when you published
your results in a prestigious journal. Everyone knew that...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">THE VILLAGE HIDDEN IN THE CLARITY</p>
<p>"Consider the computational power required to manifest over a
hundred shadow clones," the Uchiha genius said in his dispassionate
tones. "It is an error of rationality, Sakura, to say 'fluke' and
think you have explained anything. 'Fluke' is simply the name one
gives to data that one is ignoring."</p>
<p>"But it <i>has</i> to be a fluke!" Sakura yelled. With effort,
she calmed her voice into the careful precision expected of a
rationality ninja; it wouldn't do to have her crush think she was
stupid. "Like you said, the computational power required to use
over a hundred Kage Bunshin is simply absurd. We're talking the
level of a major superintelligence. Naruto's the dead last of our
class. He's not even jounin-level smart, let alone a
superintelligence!"</p>
<p>The Uchiha's eyes gleamed, almost as though he had activated his
Smartingan. "Naruto can manifest a hundred independently acting
clones. He <i>must</i> have the raw brainpower. But, under ordinary
circumstances, something prevents him from using this computational
power efficiently... like a mind at war within itself, perhaps? We
now have cause to believe that Naruto is in some way connected to a
superintelligence, and as a recently graduated genin, he, like us,
is fifteen years old. What happened fifteen years ago, Sakura?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for Sakura to comprehend, to remember, and then
she understood.</p>
<p>The attack of the Nine-Brains Demon Fox.</p>
<p>Just a small bone-white creature with big ears and bigger tail
and beady red eyes. It was no stronger than an ordinary fox, it
didn't breathe fire or flash laser eyes, it possessed no chakra and
no magic of any kind, but its intelligence was over nine thousand
times that of a human being.</p>
<p>Hundreds had been killed, half the buildings wrecked, almost the
whole village of Beisugakure had been destroyed.</p>
<p>"You think the Kyubey is hiding inside Naruto?" Sakura said. A
moment later, her brain automatically went on to fill in the
obvious implications of the theory. "And the software conflict
between their existences is why he acts like a gibbering idiot half
the time, but can control a hundred Kage Bunshin. Huh. That
makes... a lot of sense... actually..."</p>
<p>Sasuke gave her the brief, contemptuous nod of someone who had
figured all this out on his own, without anyone else needing to
prompt <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>"Ano..." said Sakura. Only years of sanity exercises channeled
her complete screaming panic into pragmatically useful policy
options. "Shouldn't we... <i>tell</i> someone about this? Like,
sometime in the next five seconds?"</p>
<p>"The adults already know," Sasuke said emotionlessly. "It is the
obvious explanation for their treatment of Naruto. No, the real
question is how this fits into the outwitting of the Uchiha..."</p>
<p>"I don't see how it fits at all -" began Sakura.</p>
<p>"It <i>must</i> fit!" A tinge of frantic emotion flickered in
Sasuke's voice. "I asked that man <i>why</i> he did it, and he told
me that when I knew the answer to that, it would explain
<i>everything!</i> Surely <i>this</i> must also be part of what is
to be explained!"</p>
<p>Sakura sighed to herself. Her personal hypothesis was that
Itachi had just been trying to drive his brother into clinical
paranoia.</p>
<p>"Yo, kids," said the voice of their rationality sensei from
their radio earpieces. "There's a village in Wave trying to build a
bridge, and it keeps falling down for no reason anyone can figure
out. Meet up at the gates at noon. It's time for your first
C-ranked analysis mission."</p>

<p>"How could you do it, Anita?" said Richard, his voice very
tight. "How could you coauthor a paper with Jean-Claude? You
<i>study</i> the undead, you don't collaborate with them on
papers!"</p>
<p>"And what about you?" I spat. "You coauthored a paper with
Sylvie! It's all right for <i>you</i> to be prolific but not
<i>me?</i>"</p>
<p>"I'm the <i>head of her institute</i>," Richard growled. I could
feel the waves of science radiating off him; he was angry. "I
<i>have</i> to work with Sylvie, it doesn't mean anything! I
thought our own research was special, Anita!"</p>
<p>"It <i>is,</i>" I said, feeling helpless about my inability to
explain things to Richard. He didn't understand the thrill of being
a polymath, the new worlds that were opening up to me. "I didn't
share <i>our</i> research with anyone -"</p>
<p>"But you wanted to," said Richard.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, but I knew that the look on my face said
it all.</p>
<p>"God, Anita, you've changed," said Richard. He seemed to slump
in on himself. "Do you realize that the monsters are joking about
Blake numbers, now? I used to be your partner in everything, and
now - I'm just another werewolf with a Blake number of 1."</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">THE NAME OF THE RATIONALITY</p>
<p>The eleven-year-old boy who would someday become legend - slayer
of dragons, killer of kings - had but one thought upon his mind, as
he approached the Sorting Hat to enter into the study of
mysteries.</p>
<p><i>Anywhere but Ravenclaw anywhere but Ravenclaw oh please
anywhere but Ravenclaw...</i></p>
<p>But no sooner the brim of the ancient felted device slipped over
his forehead -</p>
<p>"RAVENCLAW!"</p>
<p>As the table decked in blue began to applaud him, as he
approached the dread table where he would spend the next seven
years, Kvothe was already wincing inside, waiting for the
inevitable; and the inevitable happened almost at once, exactly as
he had feared it, before he'd even had a chance to sit down
properly.</p>
<p>"So!" an older boy said with the happy expression of someone
who's thought of something terribly clever. "Kvothe the Raven,
huh?"</p>

<p>"Edward," said Isabella tenderly. She reached up a hand and
stroked his cold, sparkling cheek. "You don't have to protect me
from anything. I've listed out all the upsides and all the
downsides, assigned them consistent relative weights, and it's just
really obvious that the benefits of becoming a vampire outweigh the
drawbacks."</p>
<p>"Bella," Edward said, and swallowed desperately. "Bella -"</p>
<p>"Immortality. Perfect health. Awakening psychic powers. Easy
enough to survive on animal blood once you do it. Even the beauty,
Edward, there are people who would give their lives to be pretty,
and don't you dare call them shallow until you've tried being ugly.
Do you think I'm scared of the word 'vampire'? I'm tired of your
arbitrary deontological constraints, Edward. The whole human
species ought to be in on your fun, and people are dying by the
thousands even as you hesitate."</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(<b>contributed by Histocrat</b> on
LiveJournal, post 13389, aka <b>HonoreDB</b> on LessWrong)<br />
(reposted with permission)</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Interloper, abandon this strange prank,<br />
which makes cruel use of the blindness of my grief,<br />
and the good heart of my good friend Horatio.<br />
Or else, if thou hast true title to this belov'd form,<br />
tell me:<br />
What drawing did I present to Hamlet King,<br />
when six years old and scarce out of my sling?</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
'twas a unicorn clad all in mail.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
What.</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
Mark me.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Father, I will.</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
My hour is almost come,<br />
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames<br />
Must render up myself.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Thou art in torment?</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
Ay, as are all who die unshriven.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Like every Dane this is what I've been taught.<br />
Yet I did figure such caprice ill-suited to almighty God.<br />
For all who suffer unlook'd for deaths, unattended by God's chosen
priests,<br />
to be then punish'd for the ill-ordering of the world...</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
'twas not the world that killed me, nor accident of any kind.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
What?</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
If thou didst ever thy dear father love,<br />
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Oh God.</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
My time grows ever shorter. Wilt thou hear the tale?</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
No.</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
What?</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
My love for you does call me to avenge your death,<br />
but greater crimes have I heard told this night.<br />
If all those murdered go to Hell, and others as well,<br />
who would have confess'd had they the time,<br />
If people who are, in balance, good, suffer grisly<br />
at the hands of God, then I defy God's plan.</p>
<p>Good Ghost, as one who dwells beyond the veil,<br />
you know things that we mortals scarce conceive.<br />
Tell me: is there some philter or device,<br />
outside nature's ken but not outside her means,<br />
by which death itself may be escap'd?</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
You seek to evade Hell?</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
I seek to deny Hell to everyone!<br />
and Heaven too, for I suspect the Heaven of our mad God<br />
might be a paltry thing, next to the Heaven I will make of
Earth,<br />
when I am its immortal king.</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
I care not for these things.<br />
Death and hell have stripp'd away all of my desires,<br />
save for revenge upon my murderer.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Thou shalt not be avenged, save that thou swear:<br />
an I slay thine killer, so wilt thou vouchsafe to me the
means<br />
by which I might slay death.</p>
<p>He who killed you will join you in the Pit,<br />
and then that's it. No further swelling of Hell's ranks will I
permit.</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
Done. When my brother is slain, he who poured the poison in my
ear,<br />
then will I pour in yours the precious truth:<br />
the making of the Philosopher's Stone. With this Stone, thou may'st
procure<br />
a philter to render any man immune to death, and more
transmute<br />
base metal to gold, to fund the provision of this philter to all
mankind.</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Truly there is nothing beyond the dreaming of philosophy.<br />
Wait.<br />
The man whom I must kill-my uncle the king?</p>
<p>Ghost<br />
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br />
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-</p>
<p>HAMLET<br />
Indeed, he has such gifts I near despair,<br />
of killing him and yet succeeding to his throne.<br />
'twill be an awesome fight for awesome stakes.<br />
Hast thou advice?</p>
<p><i>A cock crows. Exit Ghost.</i></p>

<p>MORPHEUS: For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it. But then
I saw the fields with my own eyes, watched them liquefy the dead so
they could be fed intravenously to the living -</p>
<p>NEO <i>(politely)</i>: Excuse me, please.</p>
<p>MORPHEUS: Yes, Neo?</p>
<p>NEO: I've kept quiet for as long as I could, but I feel a
certain need to speak up at this point. The human body is the most
inefficient source of energy you could possibly imagine. The
efficiency of a power plant at converting thermal energy into
electricity <i>decreases</i> as you run the turbines at lower
temperatures. If you had any sort of food humans could eat, it
would be more efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to
humans. And now you're telling me that their food is <i>the bodies
of the dead, fed to the living?</i> Haven't you ever heard of the
laws of thermodynamics?</p>
<p>MORPHEUS: Where did <i>you</i> hear about the laws of
thermodynamics, Neo?</p>
<p>NEO: Anyone who's made it past one science class in high school
ought to know about the laws of thermodynamics!</p>
<p>MORPHEUS: Where did you go to high school, Neo?</p>
<p>(Pause.)</p>
<p>NEO: ...in the Matrix.</p>
<p>MORPHEUS: The machines tell elegant lies.</p>
<p>(Pause.)</p>
<p>NEO <i>(in a small voice)</i>: Could I please have a real
physics textbook?</p>
<p>MORPHEUS: There is no such thing, Neo. The universe doesn't run
on math.</p>
