      "Yes, sir.  [Lane goes out.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  I\n",
      "wish to goodness you had let me know.  I have been writing frantic letters to\n",
      "Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a large reward.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than\n",
      "usually hard up.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Opens case\n",
      "and examines it.]  However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\n",
      "inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Of course it’s mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a\n",
      "hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\n",
      "inside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\n",
      "read and what one shouldn’t.  More than half of modern culture depends on\n",
      "what one shouldn’t read.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern\n",
      "culture.  It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private.  I simply want\n",
      "my cigarette case back.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes; but this isn’t your cigarette case.  This cigarette case is a\n",
      "present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know\n",
      "any one of that name.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Your aunt!\n",

      "Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.  Just\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herself little\n",
      "Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?  [Reading.]  ‘From\n",
      "little Cecily with her fondest love.’\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what on earth\n",
      "is there in that?  Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.  That is a matter\n",
      "that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.  You seem to think\n",
      "that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!  That is absurd!  For\n",
      "Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case.  [Follows Algernon round the\n",
      "room.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  ‘From little\n",
      "Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’  There is no objection, I\n",
      "admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size\n",
      "may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can’t quite make out.\n",
      "Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you to\n",
      "every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look as if your\n",
      "name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my\n",
      "life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest.  It’s on\n",
      "your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from case.]  ‘Mr. Ernest Worthing,\n",
      "B. 4, The Albany.’  I’ll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever\n",
      "you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the\n",

      "Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\n",
      "cigarette case was given to me in the country.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\n",
      "Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.  Come, old boy,\n",
      "you had much better have the thing out at once.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is very\n",
      "vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist.  It produces a false\n",
      "impression.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on!  Tell\n",
      "me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected you of being\n",
      "a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as\n",
      "soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and\n",
      "Jack in the country.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, produce my cigarette case first.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your explanation,\n",
      "and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\n",
      "all.  In fact it’s perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me\n",
      "when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter,\n",
      "Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of\n",
      "respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country\n",
      "under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Where is that place in the country, by the way?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited . . . I\n",
      "may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over\n",
      "Shropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest in\n",
      "town and Jack in the country?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my\n",
      "real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in the\n",
      "position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.\n",
      "It’s one’s duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to\n",
      "conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness, in order to get up\n",
      "to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of\n",
      "Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.  That,\n",
      "my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would be\n",
      "very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don’t try it.\n",
      "You should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University.  They do it\n",
      "so well in the daily papers.  What you really are is a Bunburyist.  I was quite\n",
      "right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  You are one of the most advanced\n",
      "Bunburyists I know.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "What on earth do you mean?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in\n",
      "order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  I have\n",
      "invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may\n",
      "be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury is perfectly\n",
      "invaluable.  If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I\n",
      "wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s to-night, for I have been really\n",
      "engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.\n",
      "It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\n",
      "invitations.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.  To\n",
      "begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine\n",
      "with one’s own relations.  In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am\n",
      "always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no\n",
      "woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will\n",
      "place me next to, to-night.  She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always\n",
      "flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.\n",
      "Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the\n",
      "increase.  The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands\n",
      "is perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one’s clean linen\n",
      "in public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\n",
      "naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the rules.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I’m not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\n",
      "kill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case.  Cecily is a little too\n",
      "much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am going to get rid of Ernest.\n",
      "And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend\n",
      "who has the absurd name.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\n",
      "married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to\n",
      "know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\n",
      "tedious time of it.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\n",
      "the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won’t want to\n",
      "know Bunbury.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Then your wife will.  You don’t seem to realise, that in married life\n",
      "three is company and two is none.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\n",
      "corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "For heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical.  It’s perfectly easy to be\n",
      "cynical.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "My dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays.  There’s\n",
      "such a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell is\n",
      "heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring\n",
      "in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so\n",
      "that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with\n",
      "you to-night at Willis’s?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I suppose so, if you want to.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are not\n",
      "serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.\n",
      "[Enter Lane.]\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "[Algernon goes forward to meet them.  Enter Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen.]\n",

      "Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving\n",
      "very well.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "That’s not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things rarely\n",
      "go together.  [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room for\n",
      "developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.  [Gwendolen and\n",
      "Jack sit down together in the corner.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I’m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged\n",
      "to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s\n",
      "death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.\n",
      "And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches\n",
      "you promised me.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Won’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n",

      "[Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why\n",
      "are there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "[Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  I\n",
      "went down twice.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "No cucumbers!\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "No, sir.  Not even for ready money.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "That will do, Lane, thank you.\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]\n",

      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I, of\n",
      "course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you.  I’ve quite\n",
      "a treat for you to-night,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I am going to send you down with Mary\n",
      "Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.  It’s\n",
      "delightful to watch them.\n",

      "[Frowning.]  I hope not,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It would put my table\n",
      "completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.  Fortunately he is\n",
      "accustomed to that.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\n",
      "to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend\n",
      "Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances with Jack.]  They seem to think\n",
      "I should be with him.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from\n",
      "curiously bad health.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that\n",
      "Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.  This\n",
      "shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of\n",
      "the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid.  Illness of any kind\n",
      "is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health is the primary duty of\n",
      "life.  I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take\n",
      "much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.  I should be\n",
      "much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not\n",
      "to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It\n",
      "is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage\n",
      "conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has\n",
      "practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably\n",
      "not much.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\n",
      "think I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday.  Of course the music is a\n",
      "great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if\n",
      "one plays bad music people don’t talk.  But I’ll run over the programme I’ve\n",
      "drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Thank you,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is very thoughtful of you.\n",
      "[Rising, and following Algernon.]  I’m sure the programme will be delightful,\n",
      "after a few expurgations.  French songs I cannot possibly allow.  People\n",
      "always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\n",
      "vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  But German sounds a thoroughly respectable\n",
      "language, and indeed, I believe is so.  Gwendolen, you will accompany me.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Certainly, mamma.\n",
      "[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\n",

      "Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "I do mean something else.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell’s\n",
      "temporary absence . . .\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way of\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "[Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you\n",
      "more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wish that in\n",
      "public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.  For me you have\n",
      "always had an irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I was far from\n",
      "indifferent to you.  [Jack looks at her in amazement.]  We live, as I hope you\n",
      "know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.  The fact is constantly mentioned in\n",
      "the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial\n",
      "pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name\n",
      "of Ernest.  There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.\n",
      "The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest,\n",
      "I knew I was destined to love you.\n",

      "own.  It produces vibrations.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other\n",
      "much nicer names.  I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any\n",
      "at all, indeed.  It does not thrill.  It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have\n",
      "known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually\n",
      "plain.  Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!  And I pity any\n",
      "woman who is married to a man called John.  She would probably never be\n",
      "allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s solitude.  The\n",
      "only really safe name is Ernest.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Gwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married\n",
      "at once.  There is no time to be lost.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Married, Mr. Worthing?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and you led\n",
      "me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I adore you.  But you haven’t proposed to me yet.  Nothing has\n",
      "been said at all about marriage.  The subject has not even been touched on.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well . . . may I propose to you now?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spare you\n",
      "any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite\n",
      "frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Gwendolen!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You know what I have got to say to you.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, but you don’t say it.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it!  I\n",
      "am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brother\n",
      "Gerald does.  All my girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyes you\n",
      "have, Ernest!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you will always look at me\n",
      "just like that, especially when there are other people present.  [Enter Lady\n",
      "Bracknell.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.\n",
      "It is most indecorous.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must beg you to\n",
      "retire.  This is no place for you.  Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\n",
      "yet.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Finished what, may I ask?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you do\n",
      "become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him,\n",
      "will inform you of the fact.  An engagement should come on a young girl as a\n",
      "surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It is hardly a matter that\n",
      "she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I have a few\n",
      "questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.  While I am making these inquiries,\n",
      "you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Reproachfully.]  Mamma!\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to the door.\n",
      "She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell’s back.  Lady\n",
      "Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise\n",
      "was.  Finally turns round.]  Gwendolen, the carriage!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\n",
      "[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tell you that\n",
      "you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\n",
      "list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together, in fact.  However, I\n",
      "am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really\n",
      "affectionate mother requires.  Do you smoke?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have an\n",
      "occupation of some kind.  There are far too many idle men in London as it is.\n",
      "How old are you?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Twenty-nine.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "A very good age to be married at.  I have always been of\n",
      "opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything\n",
      "or nothing.  Which do you know?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anything that\n",
      "tampers with natural ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch\n",
      "it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern education is radically\n",
      "unsound.  Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect\n",
      "whatsoever.  If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and\n",
      "probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.  What is your income?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Between seven and eight thousand a year.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "In investments, chiefly.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expected of\n",
      "one during one’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death,\n",
      "land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives one position, and\n",
      "prevents one from keeping it up.  That’s all that can be said about land.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\n",
      "fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don’t depend on that for my real\n",
      "income.  In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who\n",
      "make anything out of it.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that point\n",
      "can be cleared up afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girl with a\n",
      "simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside\n",
      "in the country.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady\n",
      "Bloxham.  Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months’ notice.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Lady Bloxham?  I don’t know her.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerably advanced in\n",
      "years.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of\n",
      "character.  What number in Belgrave Square?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "149.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thought\n",
      "there was something.  However, that could easily be altered.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Do you mean the fashion, or the side?\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are your\n",
      "politics?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or come in\n",
      "the evening, at any rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parents living?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I have lost both my parents.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a\n",
      "misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  Who was your father?  He\n",
      "was evidently a man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radical papers\n",
      "call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I am afraid I really don’t know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\n",
      "had lost my parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem\n",
      "to have lost me . . . I don’t actually know who I am by birth.  I was . . . well, I\n",
      "was found.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Found!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\n",
      "kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he\n",
      "happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.\n",
      "Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seaside resort.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class\n",
      "ticket for this seaside resort find you?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "A hand-bag?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Very seriously.]  Yes,\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I was in a hand-bag—a\n",
      "somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-\n",
      "bag in fact.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew\n",
      "come across this ordinary hand-bag?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him in mistake\n",
      "for his own.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "The cloak-room at Victoria Station?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes.  The Brighton line.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel\n",
      "somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  To be born, or at any\n",
      "rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display\n",
      "a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the\n",
      "worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I presume you know what that\n",
      "unfortunate movement led to?  As for the particular locality in which the hand-\n",
      "bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a\n",
      "social indiscretion—has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before\n",
      "now—but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised\n",
      "position in good society.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardly say\n",
      "I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and\n",
      "acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to\n",
      "produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that.  I can produce\n",
      "the hand-bag at any moment.  It is in my dressing-room at home.  I really think\n",
      "that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Me, sir!  What has it to do with me?  You can hardly\n",
      "imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter\n",
      "—a girl brought up with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and\n",
      "form an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\n",
      "[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Good morning!  [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the\n",
      "Wedding March.  Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.]  For\n",
      "goodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune, Algy.  How idiotic you are!\n",
      "[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Didn’t it go off all right, old boy?  You don’t mean to say\n",
      "Gwendolen refused you?  I know it is a way she has.  She is always refusing\n",
      "people.  I think it is most ill-natured of her.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.  As far as she is concerned, we\n",
      "are engaged.  Her mother is perfectly unbearable.  Never met such a Gorgon . .\n",
      ". I don’t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite sure that Lady\n",
      "Bracknell is one.  In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is\n",
      "rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn’t talk about your\n",
      "own aunt in that way before you.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.  It is the only\n",
      "thing that makes me put up with them at all.  Relations are simply a tedious\n",
      "pack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor\n",
      "the smallest instinct about when to die.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, that is nonsense!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It isn’t!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, I won’t argue about the matter.  You always want to argue about\n",
      "things.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "That is exactly what things were originally made for.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Upon my word, if I thought that, I’d shoot myself . . . [A pause.]  You\n",
      "don’t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother in\n",
      "about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.  No\n",
      "man does.  That’s his.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Is that clever?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\n",
      "civilised life should be.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays.  You\n",
      "can’t go anywhere without meeting clever people.  The thing has become an\n",
      "absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "We have.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I should extremely like to meet them.  What do they talk about?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "The fools?  Oh! about the clever people, of course.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "What fools!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being\n",
      "Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[In a very patronising manner.]  My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite the\n",
      "sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  What extraordinary ideas\n",
      "you have about the way to behave to a woman!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she\n",
      "is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, that is nonsense.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "What about your brother?  What about the profligate Ernest?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.  I’ll say he\n",
      "died in Paris of apoplexy.  Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly,\n",
      "don’t they?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, but it’s hereditary, my dear fellow.  It’s a sort of thing that\n",
      "runs in families.  You had much better say a severe chill.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You are sure a severe chill isn’t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Of course it isn’t!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Very well, then.  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly, in\n",
      "Paris, by a severe chill.  That gets rid of him.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\n",
      "interested in your poor brother Ernest?  Won’t she feel his loss a good deal?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.\n",
      "She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to\n",
      "her lessons.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I would rather like to see Cecily.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I will take very good care you never do.  She is excessively pretty, and\n",
      "she is only just eighteen.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty\n",
      "ward who is only just eighteen?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh! one doesn’t blurt these things out to people.  Cecily and\n",
      "Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.  I’ll bet you\n",
      "anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling\n",
      "each other sister.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of\n",
      "other things first.  Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis’s,\n",
      "we really must go and dress.  Do you know it is nearly seven?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is nearly seven.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I’m hungry.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I never knew you when you weren’t . . .\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "What shall we do after dinner?  Go to a theatre?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh no!  I loathe listening.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, let us go to the Club?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, no!  I hate talking.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, no!  I can’t bear looking at things.  It is so silly.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, what shall we do?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Nothing!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don’t mind\n",
      "hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.\n",
      "[Enter Lane.]\n",
      "Lane.\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Algy, kindly turn your back.  I have something very particular to\n",
      "say to Mr. Worthing.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Really, Gwendolen, I don’t think I can allow this at all.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.\n",
      "You are not quite old enough to do that.  [Algernon retires to the fireplace.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My own darling!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Ernest, we may never be married.  From the expression on\n",
      "mamma’s face I fear we never shall.  Few parents nowadays pay any regard to\n",
      "what their children say to them.  The old-fashioned respect for the young is\n",
      "fast dying out.  Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of\n",
      "three.  But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife, and I\n",
      "may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can possibly do\n",
      "can alter my eternal devotion to you.\n",

      "Dear Gwendolen!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma,\n",
      "with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\n",

      "No.  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "In Paris!  [Shakes his head.]  I fear that hardly points to any very\n",
      "serious state of mind at the last.  You would no doubt wish me to make some\n",
      "slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.  [Jack presses his\n",

      "wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful, or, as in the present\n",
      "case, distressing.  [All sigh.]  I have preached it at harvest celebrations,\n",
      "christenings, confirmations, on days of humiliation and festal days.  The last\n",
      "time I delivered it was in the Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the\n",

      "Bishop, who was present, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr.\n",
      "Chasuble?  I suppose you know how to christen all right?  [Dr. Chasuble looks\n",
      "astounded.]  I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren’t you?\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector’s most constant duties in\n",
      "this parish.  I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.  But they\n",
      "don’t seem to know what thrift is.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr.\n",
      "Worthing?  Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh yes.\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "[Bitterly.]  People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.  I am very fond of children.  No!\n",
      "the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon, if you have\n",
      "nothing better to do.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I don’t remember anything about it.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "But have you any grave doubts on the subject?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don’t know if the thing would\n",
      "bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is\n",
      "a perfectly canonical practice.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Immersion!\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that is\n",
      "necessary, or indeed I think advisable.  Our weather is so changeable.  At what\n",
      "hour would you wish the ceremony performed?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremonies to\n",
      "perform at that time.  A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\n",
      "outlying cottages on your own estate.  Poor Jenkins the carter, a most hard-\n",
      "working man.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh!  I don’t see much fun in being christened along with other babies.\n",
      "It would be childish.  Would half-past five do?\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr.\n",
      "Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I would merely\n",
      "beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem to us bitter\n",
      "trials are often blessings in disguise.\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.\n",
      "[Enter Cecily from the house.]\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Uncle Jack!  Oh, I am pleased to see you back.  But what horrid\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "What is the matter, Uncle Jack?  Do look happy!  You look as if you\n",
      "had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you.  Who do you think is in\n",
      "the dining-room?  Your brother!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Who?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Your brother Ernest.  He arrived about half an hour ago.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "What nonsense!  I haven’t got a brother.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, don’t say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you in the\n",
      "past he is still your brother.  You couldn’t be so heartless as to disown him.\n",
      "I’ll tell him to come out.  And you will shake hands with him, won’t you,\n",
      "Uncle Jack?  [Runs back into the house.]\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "These are very joyful tidings.\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return\n",
      "seems to me peculiarly distressing.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My brother is in the dining-room?  I don’t know what it all means.  I\n",
      "think it is perfectly absurd.\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am\n",
      "very sorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a better\n",
      "life in the future.  [Jack glares at him and does not take his hand.]\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother’s hand?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming down here\n",
      "disgraceful.  He knows perfectly well why.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernest has\n",
      "just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he goes\n",
      "to visit so often.  And surely there must be much good in one who is kind to an\n",
      "invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed of pain.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\n",
      "of health.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Bunbury!  Well, I won’t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\n",
      "anything else.  It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But I must\n",
      "say that I think that Brother John’s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.  I\n",
      "expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is the first\n",
      "time I have come here.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Uncle Jack, if you don’t shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive\n",
      "you.\n",

      "Never forgive me?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Never, never, never!\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as\n",
      "possible.  I don’t allow any Bunburying here.\n",

      "What?\n",
      "Merriman.\n",
      "Mr. Ernest’s luggage, sir.  I have unpacked it and put it in the\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "His luggage?\n",
      "Merriman.\n",

      "I am afraid I can’t stay more than a week this time.\n",

      "Yes, you have.\n",

      "My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in\n",
      "the smallest degree.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I can quite understand that.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, Cecily is a darling.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that.  I don’t like it.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I don’t like your clothes.  You look perfectly ridiculous in\n",
      "them.  Why on earth don’t you go up and change?  It is perfectly childish to be\n",
      "in deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week with you\n",
      "in your house as a guest.  I call it grotesque.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or\n",
      "anything else.  You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I certainly won’t leave you so long as you are in mourning.  It\n",
      "would be most unfriendly.  If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I\n",
      "suppose.  I should think it very unkind if you didn’t.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, if you are not too long.  I never saw anybody take so long to\n",
      "dress, and with such little result.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you\n",
      "are.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being\n",
      "always immensely over-educated.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence\n",
      "in my garden utterly absurd.  However, you have got to catch the four-five,\n",
      "and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.  This Bunburying,\n",
      "as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\n",
      "[Goes into the house.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I think it has been a great success.  I’m in love with Cecily, and\n",
      "that is everything.\n",

      "Then have we got to part?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I am afraid so.  It’s a very painful parting.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a\n",
      "very brief space of time.  The absence of old friends one can endure with\n",
      "equanimity.  But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\n",
      "just been introduced is almost unbearable.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",

      "Yes, Miss.  [Exit Merriman.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and\n",
      "openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of\n",
      "absolute perfection.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest.  If you will allow\n",
      "me, I will copy your remarks into my diary.  [Goes over to table and begins\n",
      "writing in diary.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Do you really keep a diary?  I’d give anything to look at it.  May\n",
      "I?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh no.  [Puts her hand over it.]  You see, it is simply a very young\n",
      "girl’s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for\n",
      "publication.  When it appears in volume form I hope you will order a copy.\n",
      "But pray, Ernest, don’t stop.  I delight in taking down from dictation.  I have\n",
      "reached ‘absolute perfection’.  You can go on.  I am quite ready for more.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Somewhat taken aback.]  Ahem!  Ahem!\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, don’t cough, Ernest.  When one is dictating one should speak\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "But how did we become engaged?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\n",
      "younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed the\n",
      "chief topic of conversation between myself and\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "And of course a\n",
      "man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  One feels there must\n",
      "be something in him, after all.  I daresay it was foolish of me, but I fell in love\n",
      "with you, Ernest.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Darling!  And when was the engagement actually settled?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "On the 14th of February last.  Worn out by your entire ignorance of\n",
      "my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and after a\n",
      "long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old tree here.  The\n",
      "next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the little bangle with\n",
      "the true lover’s knot I promised you always to wear.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Did I give you this?  It’s very pretty, isn’t it?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, you’ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest.  It’s the excuse I’ve\n",
      "always given for your leading such a bad life.  And this is the box in which I\n",
      "keep all your dear letters.  [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces letters\n",
      "tied up with blue ribbon.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "My letters!  But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you\n",
      "any letters.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.  I remember only too well\n",
      "that I was forced to write your letters for you.  I wrote always three times a\n",
      "week, and sometimes oftener.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, I couldn’t possibly.  They would make you far too conceited.\n",
      "[Replaces box.]  The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\n",
      "engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can hardly\n",
      "read them without crying a little.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But was our engagement ever broken off?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Of course it was.  On the 22nd of last March.  You can see the entry if\n",
      "you like. [Shows diary.]  ‘To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.  I\n",
      "feel it is better to do so.  The weather still continues charming.’\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But why on earth did you break it off?  What had I done?  I had\n",
      "done nothing at all.  Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\n",
      "off.  Particularly when the weather was so charming.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn’t\n",
      "been broken off at least once.  But I forgave you before the week was out.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Crossing to her, and kneeling.]  What a perfect angel you are,\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through\n",
      "his hair.]  I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\n",

      "You’ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I don’t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\n",
      "Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\n",
      "dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernon rises,\n",
      "Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute\n",
      "confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called\n",
      "Ernest.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I\n",
      "had some other name?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "But what name?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Oh, any name you like—Algernon—for instance . . .\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "But I don’t like the name of Algernon.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can’t see\n",
      "why you should object to the name of\n",

      "Cecily.\n",

      "that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard that you\n",

      "Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a\n",
      "very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I\n",
      "like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people are never\n",
      "wrong.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "I don’t think so.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely\n",
      "unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seems to me to be\n",
      "the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a man begins to neglect his\n",
      "domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?  And I don’t\n",
      "like that.  It makes men so very attractive.  Cecily, mamma, whose views on\n",
      "education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-\n",
      "sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you through my\n",
      "glasses?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh no!  I live here.\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\n",

      "Indeed?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Your guardian?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward.\n",
      "How secretive of him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am not sure,\n",
      "however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.  [Rising\n",
      "and going to her.]  I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I\n",
      "met you!  But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr.\n",
      "Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were—well, just a little\n",
      "older than you seem to be—and not quite so very alluring in appearance.  In\n",
      "fact, if I may speak candidly—\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say,\n",
      "one should always be quite candid.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were\n",
      "fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.  Ernest has a strong\n",
      "upright nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour.  Disloyalty would be\n",
      "as impossible to him as deception.  But even men of the noblest possible moral\n",
      "character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of\n",
      "others.  Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us with many most\n",
      "painful examples of what I refer to.  If it were not so, indeed, History would be\n",
      "quite unreadable.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It is his\n",
      "brother—his elder brother.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that he had\n",
      "a brother.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I have never\n",
      "heard any man mention his brother.  The subject seems distasteful to most\n",
      "men.  Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growing almost\n",
      "anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship\n",
      "like ours, would it not?  Of course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr.\n",
      "Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason\n",
      "why I should make a secret of it to you.  Our little county newspaper is sure to\n",
      "chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to be\n",
      "married.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think there must be\n",
      "some slight error.  Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.  The announcement\n",
      "will appear in the Morning Post on Saturday at the latest.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under some\n",
      "misconception.  Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows\n",
      "diary.]\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It is certainly\n",
      "very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30.  If\n",
      "you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.  [Produces diary of her\n",
      "own.]  I never travel without my diary.  One should always have something\n",
      "sensational to read in the train.  I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any\n",
      "disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\n",
      "caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that\n",
      "since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any\n",
      "foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\n",
      "firm hand.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my\n",
      "dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\n",
      "married.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  You\n",
      "are presumptuous.  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\n",
      "duty to speak one’s mind.  It becomes a pleasure.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\n",
      "engagement?  How dare you?  This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of\n",
      "manners.  When I see a spade I call it a spade.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade.  It\n",
      "is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\n",
      "[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman.  He carries a salver, table cloth,\n",
      "and plate stand.  Cecily is about to retort.  The presence of the servants\n",
      "exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls chafe.]\n",
      "Merriman.\n",
      "Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quite close\n",
      "one can see five counties.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Five counties!  I don’t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Sweetly.]  I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen bites\n",
      "her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Looking round.]  Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in\n",
      "London.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in\n",
      "the country, if anybody who is anybody does.  The country always bores me to\n",
      "death.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Ah!  This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it\n",
      "not?  I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at present.\n",
      "It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told.  May I offer you\n",
      "some tea, Miss Fairfax?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[With elaborate politeness.]  Thank you.  [Aside.]  Detestable\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Sweetly.]  Sugar?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Superciliously.]  No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable any\n",
      "more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of\n",
      "sugar into the cup.]\n",

      "Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman.  Gwendolen drinks the tea and\n",
      "makes a grimace.  Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the bread\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked\n",
      "most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  I am known for\n",
      "the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\n",
      "nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\n",

      "machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that you\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I\n",
      "would like to be permitted to put to you.  Where is your brother Ernest?  We\n",
      "are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a matter of some\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "[Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for\n",

      "ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite\n",
      "inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  However, I will tell you quite\n",
      "frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at all.  I never had a\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, you’ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\n",

      "horrible trouble, I can’t make out.  You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butter would\n",

      "the only way to eat them.\n",

      "and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.  Gwendolen would wish it.  We\n",
      "can’t both be christened Ernest.  It’s absurd.  Besides, I have a perfect right to\n",
      "be christened if I like.  There is no evidence at all that I have ever been\n",
      "christened by anybody.  I should think it extremely probable I never was, and\n",
      "so does Dr.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "It is entirely different in your case.  You have been\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes, but you have been christened.  That is the important thing.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Quite so.  So I know my constitution can stand it.  If you are not\n",
      "quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it rather\n",
      "dangerous your venturing on it now.  It might make you very unwell.  You can\n",

      "Lane.\n",
      "I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir.  I have had very little experience\n",

      "proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then the\n",
      "excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty.  If ever I\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat\n",

      "to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Why on earth do you say that?\n",

      "Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\n",
      "Girls don’t think it right.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, that is nonsense!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It isn’t.  It is a great truth.  It accounts for the extraordinary\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  I\n",
      "wish to goodness you had let me know.  I have been writing frantic letters to\n",
      "Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a large reward.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than\n",
      "usually hard up.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\n",
      "[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver.  Algernon takes it at once.\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Opens case\n",
      "and examines it.]  However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\n",
      "inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Of course it’s mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a\n",
      "hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\n",
      "inside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\n",
      "read and what one shouldn’t.  More than half of modern culture depends on\n",
      "what one shouldn’t read.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern\n",
      "culture.  It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private.  I simply want\n",
      "my cigarette case back.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes; but this isn’t your cigarette case.  This cigarette case is a\n",
      "present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know\n",
      "any one of that name.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Your aunt!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.  Just\n",
      "give it back to me, Algy.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herself little\n",
      "Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?  [Reading.]  ‘From\n",
      "little Cecily with her fondest love.’\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what on earth\n",
      "is there in that?  Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.  That is a matter\n",
      "that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.  You seem to think\n",
      "that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!  That is absurd!  For\n",
      "Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case.  [Follows Algernon round the\n",
      "room.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  ‘From little\n",
      "Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’  There is no objection, I\n",
      "admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size\n",
      "may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can’t quite make out.\n",
      "Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you to\n",
      "every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look as if your\n",
      "name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my\n",
      "life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest.  It’s on\n",
      "your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from case.]  ‘Mr. Ernest Worthing,\n",
      "B. 4, The Albany.’  I’ll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever\n",
      "you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the\n",
      "card in his pocket.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\n",
      "cigarette case was given to me in the country.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\n",
      "Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.  Come, old boy,\n",
      "you had much better have the thing out at once.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is very\n",
      "vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist.  It produces a false\n",
      "impression.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on!  Tell\n",
      "me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected you of being\n",
      "a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as\n",
      "soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and\n",
      "Jack in the country.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, produce my cigarette case first.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your explanation,\n",
      "and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\n",
      "all.  In fact it’s perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me\n",
      "when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter,\n",
      "Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of\n",
      "respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country\n",
      "under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Where is that place in the country, by the way?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited . . . I\n",
      "may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over\n",
      "Shropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest in\n",
      "town and Jack in the country?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my\n",
      "real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in the\n",
      "position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.\n",
      "It’s one’s duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to\n",
      "conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness, in order to get up\n",
      "to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of\n",
      "Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.  That,\n",
      "my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would be\n",
      "very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don’t try it.\n",
      "You should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University.  They do it\n",
      "so well in the daily papers.  What you really are is a Bunburyist.  I was quite\n",
      "right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  You are one of the most advanced\n",
      "Bunburyists I know.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "What on earth do you mean?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in\n",
      "order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  I have\n",
      "invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may\n",
      "be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury is perfectly\n",
      "invaluable.  If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I\n",
      "wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s to-night, for I have been really\n",
      "engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.\n",
      "It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\n",
      "invitations.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.  To\n",
      "begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine\n",
      "with one’s own relations.  In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am\n",
      "always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no\n",
      "woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will\n",
      "place me next to, to-night.  She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always\n",
      "flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.\n",
      "Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the\n",
      "increase.  The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands\n",
      "is perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one’s clean linen\n",
      "in public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\n",
      "naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the rules.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I’m not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\n",
      "kill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case.  Cecily is a little too\n",
      "much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am going to get rid of Ernest.\n",
      "And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend\n",
      "who has the absurd name.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\n",
      "married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to\n",
      "know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\n",
      "tedious time of it.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\n",
      "the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won’t want to\n",
      "know Bunbury.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Then your wife will.  You don’t seem to realise, that in married life\n",
      "three is company and two is none.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\n",
      "corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "For heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical.  It’s perfectly easy to be\n",
      "cynical.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "My dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays.  There’s\n",
      "such a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell is\n",
      "heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring\n",
      "in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so\n",
      "that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with\n",
      "you to-night at Willis’s?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I suppose so, if you want to.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are not\n",

      "Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "[Algernon goes forward to meet them.  Enter Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving\n",
      "very well.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "That’s not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things rarely\n",
      "go together.  [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room for\n",
      "developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.  [Gwendolen and\n",
      "Jack sit down together in the corner.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I’m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged\n",
      "to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s\n",
      "death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.\n",
      "And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches\n",
      "you promised me.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Won’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Thanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why\n",
      "are there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "[Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  I\n",
      "went down twice.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "No cucumbers!\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "No, sir.  Not even for ready money.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "That will do, Lane, thank you.\n",
      "Lane.\n",
      "Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no\n",
      "cucumbers, not even for ready money.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "It really makes no matter,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I had some crumpets\n",
      "with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I, of\n",
      "course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you.  I’ve quite\n",
      "a treat for you to-night,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I am going to send you down with Mary\n",
      "Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.  It’s\n",
      "delightful to watch them.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\n",
      "dining with you to-night after all.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Frowning.]  I hope not,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It would put my table\n",
      "completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.  Fortunately he is\n",
      "accustomed to that.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\n",
      "to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend\n",
      "Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances with Jack.]  They seem to think\n",
      "I should be with him.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from\n",
      "curiously bad health.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that\n",
      "Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.  This\n",
      "shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of\n",
      "the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid.  Illness of any kind\n",
      "is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health is the primary duty of\n",
      "life.  I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take\n",
      "much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.  I should be\n",
      "much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not\n",
      "to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It\n",
      "is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage\n",
      "conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has\n",
      "practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably\n",
      "not much.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\n",
      "think I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday.  Of course the music is a\n",
      "great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if\n",
      "one plays bad music people don’t talk.  But I’ll run over the programme I’ve\n",
      "drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Thank you,\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is very thoughtful of you.\n",
      "[Rising, and following Algernon.]  I’m sure the programme will be delightful,\n",
      "after a few expurgations.  French songs I cannot possibly allow.  People\n",
      "always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\n",
      "vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  But German sounds a thoroughly respectable\n",
      "language, and indeed, I believe is so.  Gwendolen, you will accompany me.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Certainly, mamma.\n",
      "[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\n",
      "behind.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Pray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.\n",
      "Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that\n",
      "they mean something else.  And that makes me so nervous.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I do mean something else.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell’s\n",
      "temporary absence . . .\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way of\n",
      "coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you\n",
      "more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wish that in\n",
      "public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.  For me you have\n",
      "always had an irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I was far from\n",
      "indifferent to you.  [Jack looks at her in amazement.]  We live, as I hope you\n",
      "know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.  The fact is constantly mentioned in\n",
      "the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial\n",
      "pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name\n",
      "of Ernest.  There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.\n",
      "The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest,\n",
      "I knew I was destined to love you.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You really love me, Gwendolen?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Passionately!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Darling!  You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "My own Ernest!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "But you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name\n",
      "wasn’t Ernest?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "But your name is Ernest.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it was something else?  Do you mean\n",
      "to say you couldn’t love me then?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like\n",
      "most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual\n",
      "facts of real life, as we know them.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don’t much care about the\n",
      "name of Ernest . . . I don’t think the name suits me at all.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "It suits you perfectly.  It is a divine name.  It has a music of its\n",
      "own.  It produces vibrations.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other\n",
      "much nicer names.  I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any\n",
      "at all, indeed.  It does not thrill.  It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have\n",
      "known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually\n",
      "plain.  Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!  And I pity any\n",
      "woman who is married to a man called John.  She would probably never be\n",
      "allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s solitude.  The\n",
      "only really safe name is Ernest.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Gwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married\n",
      "at once.  There is no time to be lost.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Married, Mr. Worthing?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and you led\n",
      "me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I adore you.  But you haven’t proposed to me yet.  Nothing has\n",
      "been said at all about marriage.  The subject has not even been touched on.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well . . . may I propose to you now?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spare you\n",
      "any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite\n",
      "frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Gwendolen!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "You know what I have got to say to you.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, but you don’t say it.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it!  I\n",
      "am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brother\n",
      "Gerald does.  All my girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyes you\n",
      "have, Ernest!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you will always look at me\n",
      "just like that, especially when there are other people present.  [Enter Lady\n",
      "Bracknell.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.\n",
      "It is most indecorous.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must beg you to\n",
      "retire.  This is no place for you.  Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\n",
      "yet.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Finished what, may I ask?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you do\n",
      "become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him,\n",
      "will inform you of the fact.  An engagement should come on a young girl as a\n",
      "surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It is hardly a matter that\n",
      "she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I have a few\n",
      "questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.  While I am making these inquiries,\n",
      "you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Reproachfully.]  Mamma!\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to the door.\n",
      "She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell’s back.  Lady\n",
      "Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise\n",
      "was.  Finally turns round.]  Gwendolen, the carriage!\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\n",
      "[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tell you that\n",
      "you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\n",
      "list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together, in fact.  However, I\n",
      "am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really\n",
      "affectionate mother requires.  Do you smoke?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have an\n",
      "occupation of some kind.  There are far too many idle men in London as it is.\n",
      "How old are you?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Twenty-nine.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "A very good age to be married at.  I have always been of\n",
      "opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything\n",
      "or nothing.  Which do you know?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anything that\n",
      "tampers with natural ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch\n",
      "it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern education is radically\n",
      "unsound.  Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect\n",
      "whatsoever.  If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and\n",
      "probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.  What is your income?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Between seven and eight thousand a year.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "In investments, chiefly.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expected of\n",
      "one during one’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death,\n",
      "land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives one position, and\n",
      "prevents one from keeping it up.  That’s all that can be said about land.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\n",
      "fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don’t depend on that for my real\n",
      "income.  In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who\n",
      "make anything out of it.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that point\n",
      "can be cleared up afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girl with a\n",
      "simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside\n",
      "in the country.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady\n",
      "Bloxham.  Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months’ notice.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Lady Bloxham?  I don’t know her.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerably advanced in\n",
      "years.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of\n",
      "character.  What number in Belgrave Square?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "149.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thought\n",
      "there was something.  However, that could easily be altered.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Do you mean the fashion, or the side?\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "[Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are your\n",
      "politics?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or come in\n",
      "the evening, at any rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parents living?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I have lost both my parents.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a\n",
      "misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  Who was your father?  He\n",
      "was evidently a man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radical papers\n",
      "call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I am afraid I really don’t know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\n",
      "had lost my parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem\n",
      "to have lost me . . . I don’t actually know who I am by birth.  I was . . . well, I\n",
      "was found.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Found!\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\n",
      "kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he\n",
      "happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.\n",
      "Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seaside resort.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class\n",
      "ticket for this seaside resort find you?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "A hand-bag?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "[Very seriously.]  Yes,\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I was in a hand-bag—a\n",
      "somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-\n",
      "bag in fact.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew\n",
      "come across this ordinary hand-bag?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him in mistake\n",
      "for his own.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "The cloak-room at Victoria Station?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes.  The Brighton line.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel\n",
      "somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  To be born, or at any\n",
      "rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display\n",
      "a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the\n",
      "worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I presume you know what that\n",
      "unfortunate movement led to?  As for the particular locality in which the hand-\n",
      "bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a\n",
      "social indiscretion—has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before\n",
      "now—but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised\n",
      "position in good society.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardly say\n",
      "I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.\n",
      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and\n",
      "acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to\n",
      "produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, but are you good enough for it?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",

      "Very sad indeed.  Were you with him at the end?\n",

      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector’s most constant duties in\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don’t know if the thing would\n",
      "bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is\n",

      "Immersion!\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that is\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremonies to\n",
      "perform at that time.  A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\n",

      "Jack.\n",

      "It would be childish.  Would half-past five do?\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr.\n",
      "Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I would merely\n",
      "beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem to us bitter\n",
      "trials are often blessings in disguise.\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",

      "What nonsense!  I haven’t got a brother.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, don’t say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you in the\n",
      "past he is still your brother.  You couldn’t be so heartless as to disown him.\n",
      "I’ll tell him to come out.  And you will shake hands with him, won’t you,\n",

      "These are very joyful tidings.\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return\n",

      "Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother’s hand?\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming down here\n",
      "disgraceful.  He knows perfectly well why.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernest has\n",
      "just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he goes\n",
      "to visit so often.  And surely there must be much good in one who is kind to an\n",
      "invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed of pain.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Bunbury!  Well, I won’t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But I must\n",
      "say that I think that Brother John’s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.  I\n",
      "expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is the first\n",

      "another Bunbury.  Ah, there she is.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, I merely came back to water the roses.  I thought you were with\n",

      "It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a\n",
      "very brief space of time.  The absence of old friends one can endure with\n",
      "equanimity.  But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",

      "Merriman.\n",
      "The dog-cart is at the door, sir.  [Algernon looks appealingly at\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "Do you really keep a diary?  I’d give anything to look at it.  May\n",
      "I?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh no.  [Puts her hand over it.]  You see, it is simply a very young\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Somewhat taken aback.]  Ahem!  Ahem!\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, don’t cough, Ernest.  When one is dictating one should speak\n",

      "Algernon.\n",
      "For the last three months?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But how did we become engaged?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\n",
      "younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed the\n",
      "chief topic of conversation between myself and\n",
      "Miss Prism.\n",
      "And of course a\n",
      "man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  One feels there must\n",
      "be something in him, after all.  I daresay it was foolish of me, but I fell in love\n",
      "with you, Ernest.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Darling!  And when was the engagement actually settled?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "On the 14th of February last.  Worn out by your entire ignorance of\n",
      "my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and after a\n",
      "long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old tree here.  The\n",
      "next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the little bangle with\n",
      "the true lover’s knot I promised you always to wear.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Did I give you this?  It’s very pretty, isn’t it?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, you’ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest.  It’s the excuse I’ve\n",
      "always given for your leading such a bad life.  And this is the box in which I\n",
      "keep all your dear letters.  [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces letters\n",
      "tied up with blue ribbon.]\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "My letters!  But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you\n",
      "any letters.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.  I remember only too well\n",
      "that I was forced to write your letters for you.  I wrote always three times a\n",
      "week, and sometimes oftener.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, I couldn’t possibly.  They would make you far too conceited.\n",
      "[Replaces box.]  The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\n",
      "engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can hardly\n",
      "read them without crying a little.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But was our engagement ever broken off?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Of course it was.  On the 22nd of last March.  You can see the entry if\n",
      "you like. [Shows diary.]  ‘To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.  I\n",
      "feel it is better to do so.  The weather still continues charming.’\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But why on earth did you break it off?  What had I done?  I had\n",
      "done nothing at all.  Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\n",
      "off.  Particularly when the weather was so charming.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn’t\n",
      "been broken off at least once.  But I forgave you before the week was out.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "[Crossing to her, and kneeling.]  What a perfect angel you are,\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through\n",
      "his hair.]  I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, darling, with a little help from others.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I am so glad.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "You’ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I don’t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\n",
      "Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\n",
      "dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernon rises,\n",
      "Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute\n",
      "confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called\n",
      "Ernest.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I\n",
      "had some other name?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "But what name?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Oh, any name you like—Algernon—for instance . . .\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "But I don’t like the name of Algernon.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can’t see\n",
      "why you should object to the name of\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "It is not at all a bad name.\n",
      "In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.  Half of the chaps who get into the\n",
      "Bankruptcy Court are called\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But seriously, Cecily . . . [Moving to\n",
      "her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn’t you love me?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Rising.]  I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character,\n",
      "but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided attention.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up hat.]  Your Rector here is, I suppose,\n",
      "thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials of the\n",
      "Church?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.  He has never written a\n",
      "single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I must see him at once on a most important christening—I mean\n",
      "on most important business.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I shan’t be away more than half an hour.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and\n",
      "that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard that you\n",
      "should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.  Couldn’t you make it\n",
      "twenty minutes?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I’ll be back in no time.\n",
      "[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]\n",

      "Miss Fairfax!  I suppose one of the many good elderly women who\n",
      "are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.  I\n",
      "don’t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work.  I think it is\n",

      "Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a\n",
      "very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I\n",
      "like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people are never\n",
      "wrong.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other\n",
      "such a comparatively short time.  Pray sit down.\n",

      "I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my\n",
      "mentioning who I am.  My father is Lord Bracknell.  You have never heard of\n",
      "papa, I suppose?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I don’t think so.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely\n",
      "unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seems to me to be\n",
      "the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a man begins to neglect his\n",
      "domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?  And I don’t\n",
      "like that.  It makes men so very attractive.  Cecily, mamma, whose views on\n",
      "education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-\n",
      "sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you through my\n",
      "glasses?\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\n",

      "Your guardian?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward.\n",
      "How secretive of him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am not sure,\n",
      "however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.  [Rising\n",
      "and going to her.]  I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I\n",
      "met you!  But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr.\n",
      "Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were—well, just a little\n",
      "older than you seem to be—and not quite so very alluring in appearance.  In\n",
      "fact, if I may speak candidly—\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say,\n",
      "one should always be quite candid.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were\n",
      "fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.  Ernest has a strong\n",
      "upright nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour.  Disloyalty would be\n",
      "as impossible to him as deception.  But even men of the noblest possible moral\n",
      "character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of\n",
      "others.  Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us with many most\n",
      "painful examples of what I refer to.  If it were not so, indeed, History would be\n",
      "quite unreadable.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It is his\n",
      "brother—his elder brother.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that he had\n",
      "a brother.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I have never\n",
      "heard any man mention his brother.  The subject seems distasteful to most\n",
      "men.  Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growing almost\n",
      "anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship\n",
      "like ours, would it not?  Of course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr.\n",
      "Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason\n",
      "why I should make a secret of it to you.  Our little county newspaper is sure to\n",
      "chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to be\n",
      "married.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think there must be\n",
      "some slight error.  Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.  The announcement\n",
      "will appear in the Morning Post on Saturday at the latest.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under some\n",
      "misconception.  Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows\n",
      "diary.]\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It is certainly\n",
      "very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30.  If\n",
      "you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.  [Produces diary of her\n",
      "own.]  I never travel without my diary.  One should always have something\n",
      "sensational to read in the train.  I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any\n",
      "disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\n",
      "caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that\n",
      "since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any\n",
      "foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\n",
      "firm hand.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "[Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my\n",
      "dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\n",
      "married.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  You\n",
      "are presumptuous.  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\n",
      "duty to speak one’s mind.  It becomes a pleasure.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\n",
      "engagement?  How dare you?  This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of\n",
      "manners.  When I see a spade I call it a spade.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "[Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade.  It\n",
      "is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\n",

      "Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quite close\n",
      "one can see five counties.\n",
      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "Five counties!  I don’t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked\n",
      "most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  I am known for\n",
      "the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\n",
      "nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that you\n",

      "Cecily.\n",
      "It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable\n",

      "Gwendolen.\n",
      "An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I\n",
      "would like to be permitted to put to you.  Where is your brother Ernest?  We\n",
      "are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a matter of some\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "[Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for\n",

      "ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite\n",
      "inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  However, I will tell you quite\n",
      "frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at all.  I never had a\n",
      "brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever\n",

      "[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is.  The most wonderful\n",
      "Bunbury I have ever had in my life.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, you’ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "That is absurd.  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Serious Bunburyist!  Good heavens!\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have\n",
      "any amusement in life.  I happen to be serious about Bunburying.  What on\n",
      "earth you are serious about I haven’t got the remotest idea.  About everything,\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched\n",
      "business is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded.  You won’t be able to\n",
      "run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear Algy.  And a\n",
      "very good thing too.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Your brother is a little off colour, isn’t he, dear Jack?  You won’t\n",
      "be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom\n",
      "was.  And not a bad thing either.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking\n",
      "in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable.  To say nothing\n",
      "of the fact that she is my ward.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant,\n",
      "clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax.  To say nothing\n",

      "Jack.\n",
      "I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.  I love her.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to\n",

      "I adore her.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "I don’t think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss\n",
      "Fairfax being united.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Well, that is no business of yours.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "If it was my business, I wouldn’t talk about it.  [Begins to eat\n",
      "muffins.]  It is very vulgar to talk about one’s business.  Only people like\n",
      "stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this\n",
      "horrible trouble, I can’t make out.  You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butter would\n",
      "probably get on my cuffs.  One should always eat muffins quite calmly.  It is\n",
      "the only way to eat them.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the\n",
      "circumstances.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.\n",
      "Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me\n",
      "intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.  At the\n",
      "present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.  Besides, I am\n",
      "particularly fond of muffins.  [Rising.]\n",

      "Good heavens!  I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own\n",
      "garden.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances.  That is\n",
      "a very different thing.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "That may be.  But the muffins are the same.  [He seizes the\n",
      "muffin-dish from Jack.]\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "You can’t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.  It’s\n",
      "absurd.  I never go without my dinner.  No one ever does, except vegetarians\n",
      "and people like that.  Besides I have just made arrangements with Dr.\n",
      "Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of Ernest.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better.  I made\n",
      "arrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at 5.30,\n",
      "and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.  Gwendolen would wish it.  We\n",
      "can’t both be christened Ernest.  It’s absurd.  Besides, I have a perfect right to\n",
      "be christened if I like.  There is no evidence at all that I have ever been\n",
      "christened by anybody.  I should think it extremely probable I never was, and\n",
      "so does Dr.\n",
      "Chasuble.\n",
      "It is entirely different in your case.  You have been\n",
      "christened already.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Yes, but I have not been christened for years.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes, but you have been christened.  That is the important thing.\n",
      "Algernon.\n",
      "Quite so.  So I know my constitution can stand it.  If you are not\n",
      "quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it rather\n",
      "dangerous your venturing on it now.  It might make you very unwell.  You can\n",
      "hardly have forgotten that some one very closely connected with you was very\n",
      "nearly carried off this week in Paris by a severe chill.\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.\n",

      "Lady Bracknell.\n",
      "That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-\n",
      "five is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of the very\n",

      "years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still\n",

      "Of course I could,\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "You know I could.\n",
      "Cecily.\n",
      "Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all that time.  I hate\n",
      "waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather cross.  I am\n",
      "not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting,\n",
