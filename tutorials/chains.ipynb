       " 'text': 'Title: Growth of India\\n\\nRating: 80%\\n\\nReview:\\n\"Growth of India is a compelling and informative documentary that explores the economic and social development of India over the past few decades. The film delves into various aspects of India\\'s growth story, from its booming IT sector to its expanding middle class. The interviews with economists, politicians, and ordinary citizens provide a well-rounded perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing the country. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the vibrant colors and diverse landscapes of India. However, at times, the film feels a bit too focused on the positives and fails to address some of the darker aspects of India\\'s growth, such as income inequality and environmental degradation. Overall, Growth of India is a must-watch for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of India\\'s economic transformation.\"'}"
